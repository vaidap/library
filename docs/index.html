		"in Ecclefiajhcal Hijlory, an appellation affumed by a new feft which fprung up towards the clofe of the thirteenth century, and gained many adherents in Italy, France, and Germany. They took their denomina tion from the words of St Paul, Rom. chap. viii. ver. 2, ,14. and maintained, that the true children of God were inverted with the privilege of a full and perfeft freedom from the jurifdiftion of the law. They were enthufiarts to a degree of diftraftion, both in their principles and praftice. They refembled the Begbards, by which name they were fometimes called, in their alpeft, apparel, and manner of living. Some of their profefled principles refembled thofe of the Pantheifts; for they held, that all things flowed by emanation from God ; that rational fouls were portions of the Deity, and that the univerfe was God ; and that, by the power of contemplation, they were united to the Deity, and acquired hereby a glorious and fublime linerty, both from the finful lufts and the common inftindls of na ture : and hence they conclude, that the perfon, who was thus abforbed in the abyfs of the Deity, became a part of the Godhead, and was the fon of God, in the fame fenfe and manner that Chrift was, and that he was freed from the obligation of all laws human and divine. They treated with contempt all Chriftian ordinances, and all external a£ls of religion, as un- fuitable to the ftate of perfeftion at which they were arrived. Some of them wTere honeft but deluded en- thufiafts ; and they endured the torments infli&ed up on them by the inquifitors with aftoniftiing calmnefs and triumph. Others proceeded to the moft extrava gant licentioufnefs of conduct. They held their fecret aflemblies ftark naked, and lay in the fame beds with their fpiritual fillers, and indifcriminately with other women, without the lead fcruple or hefitation : mode- ity and decency being, according to their creed, marks of inward corruption. And fome of them proceeded ftill farther, and maintained, that the divine man, or believer, could not fin, let his condudl be ever fo hor rinle or atrocious. Many edidls were publifhed a- gainft them ; but notwithftanding the feverities they fuffered, they continued till about the middle of the fifteenth century.

The former ap plied to the ftudy of polite literature, and the educa tion of youth} vvhilft the latter were employed in manual labour, and the mechanic arts. They were frequently called Beghards and Lollards, by way of re proach.

This is prepared by decomposing muriate of ammo nia by means of quicklime with the addition of water, and afterwards distilling off the strongest portion with a gentle heat. The preparations of the different colleges vary a little,; the Edinburgh Pharmacopoeia ordering one pound of muriate of ammonia to one pound and a half of quicklime ; the London one pound to two pounds; and the Dublin 16 ounces to two pounds. No great quantity of water is necessary. The lime is first slaked with part of the water, and after it is cold, the salt and rest of the water are added, and the distillation carried on in well closed vessels. The Edinburgh col lege directs Woolf’s apparatus to be employed as a re ceiver, and orders all the separate liquors to be mixed together. '['he solution of ammonia should be perfectly limpid and transparent, should have an extremely pungent odour, should not effervesce with acids, and should pro duce no precipitate on the addition of alcohol or lime wrater. It should be kept in small bottles well stopt with ground stoppers, and should stand in a very cool place. This preparation is a very powerful stimulant, irri tating and inflaming the skin and nostrils, when applied externally °r snuffed up the nose. Hence its use as a rubefacient in rheumatism, cynanche, paralysis, and as a general stimulus in syncope, hysteria, &c. It is scarcely used internally. See below. ^ b. Alcohol ammoniatum, E.",

The same method is followed when the compound fraction is expressed in three parts or more. The foregoing rule extends to every case when there are fractions in either factor. For mixed numbers may be reduced to improper fractions, as is done in Ex. 2; and integers may be written, or understood to be written, in the form of fractions whose numerator is 1. It will be convenient, however, to give some further directions for proceeding when one of the factors is an integer, or when one or both are mixed numbers.

		"One pound of hydrogen unites with and requires 8 lb. ° oxygen for its combustion; measuring by volume, 1 cubic foot of hydrogen requires just half a cubic foot of oxygen for combustion ; the product being steam, aqueous vapour, or water. Oxygen is sixteen times as weighty as hydrogen, and so hydrogen combines with eight times its weight, and but half its volume, of oxygen. In round numbers, 1 pound of hydrogen is 200 cubic feet in bulk, at 62° Fahr., and the combining volume of oxygen is 100 cubic feet. One pound of carbon unites with 2§ lb., or 32 cubic feet, of oxygen for its complete combustion, forming carbonic acid. Atmospheric air is composed of oxygen and nitrogen, in the proportion of 1 lb. of the former to 3| lb. of the latter ; or, by volume, 1 cubic foot of oxygen to 4 cubic feet of nitrogen. Nitrogen is a neutral gas in combustion, and is present as a diluent simply; and for every cubic foot of oxygen required in combustion 5 cubic feet of air must be supplied. It follows, that for the combustion of 1 lb. of hydrogen 500 cubic feet of air are required; and for the complete combustion of 1 lb. of carbon, 160 cubic feet of air are required. These are the combining proportions of hydrogen and carbon with oxygen, and air, in combustion. In practice, the presence of an excess of oxygen above that which is chemically appropriated, is essential to the completeness of the combustion of the volatilised portions; but the amount of excess necessary becomes less as the general temperature in the furnace becomes greater. It is not needful, for present objects, to entertain the question of excess of air specifically, nor the relative demands of the varieties of hydro-carbons generated from coal. It suffices to show, generally, the proportions of air required for full chemical union with the volatile and the solid portions of the fuel; and thus illustrate the relative importance of the claims of the gases upon the general oxygen fund. It was shown that the average proportion of volatilised hydro carbons was 23J per cent, by weight of the whole body of coal, of which the hydrogen constituted 3^- per cent, and the carbon 20 per cent.; and there remained 60 per cent, as solid carbon. For illustration, take 100 lb. of coal; then the relative quantities of air chemically consumed in completely burning the combustinle elements are as follows:— Volatile / Hydrogen, 4 lbs. consumes 2000 cubic feet of air. \\ Carbon, 20 do. do. 3200 do. do. 5200 Fixed  Carbon, 60 do. do. 9600 do. do. 85 do. do. 14,800 do. do. It may be assumed, in round numbers, that, for the complete combustion of 100 lb. of coal, that is, of its com bustinle elements, 15,000 cubic feet of air is chemically consumed, or 150 cubic feet for 1 lb. of coal. And, of this supply of air, the volatile and fixed elements consume re spectively, for the volatile, about one-third, and for the fixed, two-thirds.

Moulds are implements of great ufe in fculpture, foundery, &c. The workmen employed in melting the mineral or metallic ore dug out of mines, have their feveral moulds to receive the melted metal as it comes out of the fur nace ; but thefe are different according to the diverfity of metals and works. In gold mines, they have moulds for ingots ; in filver mines, for bars; in copper and lead mines, for pigs or falmons; in tin mines, for pigs and ingots; and in iron mines, for fows, chimney backs, anvils, caldrons, pots, and other large utenfils and mer- chandifes of iron ; which are here caft, as it were, at firft hand. Moulds of founders of large works, as ftatues, bells, guns, and other brazen works, are of wax, fupported within-fide by what we call a core, and covered with- out-fide with a cape or cafe. It is in the fpace which the wax took up, which is afterwards melted away to leave it free, that the liquid metal runs, and the work is formed ; being carried thither through a great num- Moulds, ber of little canals, which cover the whole mould. <span class='hl'>See Foundery</span>. Moulds of moneyers are frames full of fand, where in the plates of metal are caft that are to ferve for the ftriking of fpecies of gold and filver. <span class='hl'>See Coining</span>. A fort of concave moulds made of clay, having within them the figures and inferiptions of ancient Roman coins, are found in many parts of England, and fuppofed to have been ufed for the calling of money. Mr Baker having been favoured wdth a fight of fome of thefe moulds found in Shropftiire, bearing the fame types and inferiptions with fome of the Roman coins, gave an account of them to the Royal Society. They w’ere found in digging of fand, at a place called Ryton in Shroplhire, about a mile from the great Watling- ftreet'road. They are all of the fize of the Roman de narius, and of little more than the thicknefs of oor halfpenny. They are made of a fmooth pot or brick clay, which feems to have been firft well cleanfed from dirt and fand, and well beaten or kneaded, to render it fit for taking a fair impreffion. There were a great many of them found together, and there are of them npt unfrequently found in Yorklhire; but they do not feem to have been met wdth in any other kingdom, ex cept that fome have been faid to be once found at Lyons. They have been fometimes found in great numbers joined together fide by fide, on one flat piece of clay, as if intended for the calling of a great num ber of coins at once ; and both thefe, and all the others that have been found, feem to have been of the empe ror Severus. They are fometimes found impreffed on both fides, and fome have the head of Severus on one fide and fome well known reverfe of his on the other. They feem plainly to have been intended for the coin age of money, though it is not eafy to fay in what manner they can have been employed for that purpofe, efpecially thofe which have impreflions on both fides, unlefs it may be fuppofed that they coined two pieces at the fame time by the help of three moulds, of which this was to be the middle one. If by difpofing thefe into fome fort of iron frame or cafe, as our letter- founders do the brafs moulds for calling their types, the melted metal could be eafily poured into them, it would certainly be a very eafy method of coining, as fuch moulds require little time or expence to make, arid therefore might be fupplied with new ones as often as they happen to break. Thefe moulds feem to have been burnt or baked fufficiently to make them hard ; but not fo as to ren der them porous like our bricks, whereby they would have loft their fmooth and even furface, which in thefe is plainly fo clofe, that whatever metal Ihould be form ed in them would have no appearance like the fand- holes by which counterfeit coins and metals are ufually detefted. Moulds of founders of fmall works are like the frames of coiners : it is in the'e frames, which are likewife filled* with fand, that their feveral works are falhioned ; into w'hich, when the two frames of which the mould is compofed, are rejoined, the melted brafs is run. Moulds of letter founders are partly of fteel and partly of wood. The wood, properly fpeaking, ferves only to covet the real mould which is within, and to 3 N 2 prevent M O U t46B] M O U Moulds. prevent the workman, who holds it in his hand, from being incommoded by the heat of the melted metal. Only one letter or type can be formed at once in each mould. <span class='hl'>See Letter Foundery</span>. Moulds, in the manufatlure of paper, are little frames compofed of feveral brafs or iron wires, faflen- ed together by another wire flill finer. Each mould is of the bignefs of the fheet of paper to be made, and has a rim or ledge of wood to which the wires are faftened. Thefe moulds are more ufually called frames or forms. <span class='hl'>See Pafkr-Making</span>. Moulds, with furnace and crucinle makers, are made of wood, of the fame form with the crucinles j that is, in form of a truncated cone : they have handles of wood to hold and turn them with, when, being covered with the earth, the workman has a mind to round or flatten his veflfel. Moulds for leaden bullets are little iron pincers, each of whofe branches terminates in a hemifpherical concave, which when {hut form an entire fphere. In the lips or fides where the branches meet, is a little jet or hole, through which the melted lead is conveyed. Laboratory Moulds -are made of w'ood, for filling and driving all forts of rockets and cartridges, &c. Glaciers Moulds. The glaziers have two kinds of moulds, both ferving to caff their lead : in the one they cafl: the lead into long rods or canes fit to be drawn through the vice, and the grooves formed therein 5 this they fometimes call ingot-mould. In the other, they mould thofe little pieces of* lead a line thick and tw7o lines broad, faftened to the iron bars. Thefe may be alfo caft in the vice. Goldfmiths Moulds. The goldfmiths ufe the bones of the cuttle fifti to make moulds for their fmall works; which they do by prefling the pattern between two bones, and leaving a jet or hole to convey the metal through, after the pattern has been taken out.

		"rder. <span class='hl'>See Architecture</span>. Ionic Sect, The, was the oldest of the ancient schools of philosophy. It originated in Asia Minor, under Thales of Miletus, about 600 b.c. Its most famous leaders after Thales were Anaximander of Miletus, Pherecydes of Syra, Anaximenes of Miletus, Heraclitus of Ephesus, Anaxagoras and Hermotimus of Clazomenae, and Diogenes of Apollonia. From Asia Minor the spirit of the Ionic philosophy passed into Greece, at first with Anaxagoras, and afterwards with Archelaus, the master of Socrates. Thus Athens, taught from Ionia, became in turn the headquarters of philosophy, and the parent of the most celebrated Greek schools. The interval between Thales and Archelaus embraced a period of about 150 years. The philosophers of the Ionic school directed their attention principally to physics and morals. A few only of their principles and beliefs can now be ascer tained from the fragments which have come down to us. In mental philosophy Pherecydes broached the doctrine of the immortality of the soul; Heraclitus speculated on the nature of the difference between the sleeping and waking state of an intellectual being, and on the individual sense,_ as distinct from general reason, the latter being the seat of all truth, the former of all error. Anaxagoras first drew the line of distinction between spirit and matter, and drew at tention to the regulative faculty in man. In physiology the great question which the Ionic philoso- 1 Unless we take as a proof of it, that sometimes a legislator who returns home, after giving obnoxious votes, is pelted wit emon by his displeased constituents. 2 Parliamentary Papers : Ionian Islands.

Thales believed in v one—water; Pherecydes in earth ; Anaximenes and Dio genes in air; and Heraclitus in fire. Archelaus believed in two—heat and cold, as represented by fire and water Those who believed in a plurality of elements, whether two or more, considered the mechanical action of these upon each other as sufficient to account for the existing state of things ; whereas those who admitted only one were obli°-ed to endow it with a principle of vitality and development to account for existing variety. The latter of these schemes is known as the dynamical theory, the former as the me chanical. Ijlut the labours of the Ionic philosophers were not confined to such speculations. Thales made such ob servations in astronomy as enabled him to calculate eclipses ; Anaximander and Anaximenes constructed sundials and maps; Heraclitus endeavoured to explain the causes of eclipses, and of the successions of the seasons ; while Anaxa goras turned his attention to the milky way, comets, winds, thunder, meteoric stones, &c. These labours of the Ionic- philosophers cleared the way for all those schools which, at a later period, undertook to explain the physical world, and served at once as a model and a starting point for Leucip pus, Democritus, Empedocles, Aristotle, and, finally, for Epicurus. In fact, most of the schools which arose in Greece, from the time of Thales to that of Socrates (b.c. 600 to b.c. 400), and constituted the first philosophic period, were in some sort so many offshoots from the Ionic philoso phy. Pythagoras, born at Samos, became the pupil of Phere cydes ; Xenophanes, the founder of the Eleatic school, was a native of Colophon ; Abdera, the birth-place of Leucip pus and Democritus, and the seat of the school which they founded, was a colony from Phocaea; and, besides, Demo critus was the pupil of Anaxagoras. In the course of its development the Ionic school was contemporary with the Abderitan and Eleatic systems, as also with that of Empe docles and Pythagoras. The first of these philosophies oc cupied itself with nearly the same questions as the thinkers of Ionia. Empedocles admitted, as the first principles of things, the elements of fire, water, earth, and air, thus at tempting to harmonize the opinions of Heraclitus, Thales, Pherecydes, Anaximenes, and Diogenes. The Pythago rean and Eleatic schools, on the other hand, were hostile°to it. They were the idealists of that early period, and, con sequently, in direct antagonism to the materialistic views of the Ionic philosophy. <span class='hl'>See Thales, Anaximander, &c</span>."
