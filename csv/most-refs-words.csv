AXIS,"in geometry, the ftraight line in a plain figure, about which it revolves, to produce or generate a fo- lid : thus, if a femi-circle be moved round its diame ter at reft, it will generate a fphere, the axis of which is that diameter. Axis, in aftronomy, is an imaginary right line fuppofed to pafs through the centre of the earth, and the hea venly bodies, about which they perform their diurnal revolutions. Axis in conic-fedtions, a right line dividing the fedtion into two equal parts, and cutting all its ordinates at right angles. See Conic Sections. Axis, in mechanics. The axis of a balance is that line about which it moves, or rather turns about. Axis of ofcillation is a right line parallel to the horizon, palling through the centre about which a pendulum vinrates. See Mechanics. Axis in peritrochio, one of the five mechanical potvers, confifting of a peritrochium or wheel concentric with with the bafe of a cylinder, and moveable together with it about its axis. See Mechanics. Axis, in optics, is that particular ray of light coming from any objedt which falls perpendicularly on the eye. See Optics. Axis, in architedture, fpiral axis, is the axis of a twill ed column drawn fpirally, in order to trace the cir cumvolutions without. Axis of the Ionic capital, is a line palling perpendi cularly through the middle of the eye of the volute. See Architecture. Axis of a veffel is an imaginary right line palling through the middle of it perpendicularly to its bafe, and equally diftant from its fides. ro ) a z 1 Axis, in anatomy, the fecond vertebra of the neck, fo called from the head’s turning on it like an axis. Axis, in zoology. See Cervus."
CALCULUS,"in natural hiftory, properly denotes a little ftone or pebble. See Pebble. Calculus, or calculus humanus, in medicine, the ftone in the bladder or kidneys. See Medicine, and Surgery. Calculus alfo denotes a method of computation, fo called from the calculi, or counters, anciently ufed for this purpofe. Hence, Calculus specialise or literalis, is the fame with algebra. See Algebra. Calculus diffcrentialis is a method of differencing quantities, that is, of finding an infinitely fmall quan tity, which being taken an infinite number of times, fhall be equal to a given quantity. See Fluxions. Calculus among mathematicians, a me thod of differencing exponential quantities, and fum- ming up the differentials of exponential quantities. See Fluxions. Calculus integralis, or summatorius, is a me thod of fumming up differential quanties ; that is, from a differential quantity given, to find the quantity from whofe differencing the given differential refults. See Fluxions."

CIRCLE,"in geometry, a plane figure comprehended by a Angle curve line, called its circumference, to which right lines drawn from a point in the middle, called the centre, are equal to each other. See Geo metry. Circles of the Sphere, are fuch as cut the mundane fphere, and have their periphery either on its move- able fiirface, or in another immoveable, conterminous, and equidifiant furface. See Sphere. Hence arife two kinds of circles, moveable and immoveable. The firft, thofe whofe peripheries are in the moveable fur- face, and which therefore revolve with its diurnal mo tion ; as, the meridians, &c. The latter having Circles their periphery in the immoveable furface, do not re- c;rcoJlcel. volve ; as the ecliptic, equator, and its parallels, &c. ‘^nes. See Geography. '   Circles of Altitude, otherwife called almucantars, are circles parallel to the horizon, having their com mon pole in the zenith, and ftill diminilhing as they approach the zenith. See Almucantar. Diurnal Circles, are immoveable circles, fuppo- fed to be ddcrined by the feven ftars, and other points of the heavens, in their diurnal rotation round the earth ; or rather, in the rotation of the earth round its axis. The diurnal circles are all unequal: the equator is the biggefi. Horary Circles, in dialing, are the lines which Ihew the hours on dials ; though thefe be not drawn circular, but nearly flraight. See Dialing. Circles of Latitude, or Secondaries of the Ecliptic, are great circles parallel to the plane of the ecliptic, palling through the poles thereof, and through every ftar and planer. They are fo called, becaufe they ferve to meafure the latitude of the ftars, which is no thing but an arch of one of thefe circles intercepted between the ftar and the ecliptic. See Latitude. Circles of Longitude, are feveral lelfer circles, parallel to the ecliptic; ftill diminilhing, in proportion as they recede from it. On the arches of thefe circles, the longitude of the ftars is reckoned. Circle of perpetual Apparition, one of the Idler circles, parallel to the equator ; deferined by any point of the fphere touching the northern point of the horizon ; and carried about with the diurnal motion. All the ftars included within this circle never fet, but are ever vifinle above the horizon. Circle of perpetual Occultation, is another circle at a like diftance from the equator ; and contains all thofe ftars which never appear in our hemifphere. The ftars fituate between thefe circles, alternately rile and fet at certain times. Polar Circles, are immoveable circles, parallel to the equator, and at a diftance from the poles equal to the greateft declination of the ecliptic. That next the northern pole is called the arctic ; and that next to the fouthern one the antarctic. Fairy Circle. See YhutY-Circle. Circle, in logic, or Logical Circle, is when the fame terms are proved in orbem by the fame terms ; and the parts of the fyllogifm alternately by each other, both direiftly and indirealy. Circles of the Empire, fiich provinces and princi palities of the German empire as have a right to be prefent at diets. Maximilian I. divided the empire into fix, and fome years after into ten circles. This laft divifion was confirmed by Charles V. The circles, as they Hand in the Imperial Matricola, are as follow : Auftria, Burgundy, the Lower Rhine, Bavaria, Up per Saxony, Tranconia, Swabia, Upper Rhine, Welt- phalia, and the Lower Saxony."

MOULD,"or Mold, in the mechanic arts, &c. a cavity artificially cut, with a defign to give its form or impreflion to fome fofter matter applied therein. Moulds are implements of great ufe in fculpture, foundery, &c. The workmen employed in melting the mineral or metallic ore dug out of mines, have their feveral moulds to receive the melted metal as it comes out of the fur nace ; but thefe are different according to the diverfity of metals and works. In gold mines, they have moulds for ingots ; in filver mines, for bars; in copper and lead mines, for pigs or falmons; in tin mines, for pigs and ingots; and in iron mines, for fows, chimney backs, anvils, caldrons, pots, and other large utenfils and mer- chandifes of iron ; which are here caft, as it were, at firft hand. Moulds of founders of large works, as ftatues, bells, guns, and other brazen works, are of wax, fupported within-fide by what we call a core, and covered with- out-fide with a cape or cafe. It is in the fpace which the wax took up, which is afterwards melted away to leave it free, that the liquid metal runs, and the work is formed ; being carried thither through a great num- Moulds, ber of little canals, which cover the whole mould. See Foundery. Moulds of moneyers are frames full of fand, where in the plates of metal are caft that are to ferve for the ftriking of fpecies of gold and filver. See Coining. A fort of concave moulds made of clay, having within them the figures and inferiptions of ancient Roman coins, are found in many parts of England, and fuppofed to have been ufed for the calling of money. Mr Baker having been favoured wdth a fight of fome of thefe moulds found in Shropftiire, bearing the fame types and inferiptions with fome of the Roman coins, gave an account of them to the Royal Society. They w’ere found in digging of fand, at a place called Ryton in Shroplhire, about a mile from the great Watling- ftreet'road. They are all of the fize of the Roman de narius, and of little more than the thicknefs of oor halfpenny. They are made of a fmooth pot or brick clay, which feems to have been firft well cleanfed from dirt and fand, and well beaten or kneaded, to render it fit for taking a fair impreffion. There were a great many of them found together, and there are of them npt unfrequently found in Yorklhire; but they do not feem to have been met wdth in any other kingdom, ex cept that fome have been faid to be once found at Lyons. They have been fometimes found in great numbers joined together fide by fide, on one flat piece of clay, as if intended for the calling of a great num ber of coins at once ; and both thefe, and all the others that have been found, feem to have been of the empe ror Severus. They are fometimes found impreffed on both fides, and fome have the head of Severus on one fide and fome well known reverfe of his on the other. They feem plainly to have been intended for the coin age of money, though it is not eafy to fay in what manner they can have been employed for that purpofe, efpecially thofe which have impreflions on both fides, unlefs it may be fuppofed that they coined two pieces at the fame time by the help of three moulds, of which this was to be the middle one. If by difpofing thefe into fome fort of iron frame or cafe, as our letter- founders do the brafs moulds for calling their types, the melted metal could be eafily poured into them, it would certainly be a very eafy method of coining, as fuch moulds require little time or expence to make, arid therefore might be fupplied with new ones as often as they happen to break. Thefe moulds feem to have been burnt or baked fufficiently to make them hard ; but not fo as to ren der them porous like our bricks, whereby they would have loft their fmooth and even furface, which in thefe is plainly fo clofe, that whatever metal Ihould be form ed in them would have no appearance like the fand- holes by which counterfeit coins and metals are ufually detefted. Moulds of founders of fmall works are like the frames of coiners : it is in the'e frames, which are likewife filled* with fand, that their feveral works are falhioned ; into w'hich, when the two frames of which the mould is compofed, are rejoined, the melted brafs is run. Moulds of letter founders are partly of fteel and partly of wood. The wood, properly fpeaking, ferves only to covet the real mould which is within, and to 3 N 2 prevent M O U t46B] M O U Moulds. prevent the workman, who holds it in his hand, from being incommoded by the heat of the melted metal. Only one letter or type can be formed at once in each mould. See Letter Foundery. Moulds, in the manufatlure of paper, are little frames compofed of feveral brafs or iron wires, faflen- ed together by another wire flill finer. Each mould is of the bignefs of the fheet of paper to be made, and has a rim or ledge of wood to which the wires are faftened. Thefe moulds are more ufually called frames or forms. See Pafkr-Making. Moulds, with furnace and crucinle makers, are made of wood, of the fame form with the crucinles j that is, in form of a truncated cone : they have handles of wood to hold and turn them with, when, being covered with the earth, the workman has a mind to round or flatten his veflfel. Moulds for leaden bullets are little iron pincers, each of whofe branches terminates in a hemifpherical concave, which when {hut form an entire fphere. In the lips or fides where the branches meet, is a little jet or hole, through which the melted lead is conveyed. Laboratory Moulds -are made of w'ood, for filling and driving all forts of rockets and cartridges, &c. Glaciers Moulds. The glaziers have two kinds of moulds, both ferving to caff their lead : in the one they cafl: the lead into long rods or canes fit to be drawn through the vice, and the grooves formed therein 5 this they fometimes call ingot-mould. In the other, they mould thofe little pieces of* lead a line thick and tw7o lines broad, faftened to the iron bars. Thefe may be alfo caft in the vice. Goldfmiths Moulds. The goldfmiths ufe the bones of the cuttle fifti to make moulds for their fmall works; which they do by prefling the pattern between two bones, and leaving a jet or hole to convey the metal through, after the pattern has been taken out. Mould, among mafons, is a piece of hard wood or iron, hollowed within fide, anfwerable to the contours of the mouldings or cornices, &c. to be formed. This is othervvife called caliner. Moulds, among plumbers, are the tables on which they caft ftieets of lead. Thefe they fometimes call {imply tables. Befides which they have other real moulds, wherewith they caft pipes without foldering. See each defcrined under Plumbery. Moulds, among the glafs grinders, are wooden frames, whereon they make the tubes wherewith they fit their perfpedlives, telefcopes, and other optic ma chines. Thefe moulds are cylinders, of a length and diameter according to the ufe they are to be applied to, but always thicker at one end than the other, to facilitate the Aiding. The tubes made on thefe moulds are of two kinds j the one Amply of pafteboard and paper ; the other of thin leaves of wood joined to the pafteboard. To make thefe tubes to draw out, only the laft or innermoft is formed on the mould j each tube made afterwards ferving as a mould to that which is to go over it, but without taking out the mould from the firft. See Grinding. Moulds ufed in bafket-making are very Ample, con fiding ordinarily of a willow or ofier turned or bent in to an oval, circle, fquare, or other figure, according to the balkets, panniers, hampers, and other utenfils in tended. Ou khefe moulds they make, or more properly meafure, all their wrork j and accordingly they have Mould them of all fizes, fhapes, &c. li Mould, in Ihip-building, a thin flexinle piece of ^0Ulinet,l timber, uftd by ihipwrights as a pattern whereby to ”~V form the different curves of the timbers, and other com- pafting pieces in a {flip’s frame. There are two forts of thefe, viz, the bend mould and hollow mould ; the form er of thefe determines the convexity ot the timbers, and the latter their concavity on the outfide, where they ap proach the heel, particularly towards the extremities of the veffel. The figure given to the timbers by this pattern is called their bevelling. Moulds, among tallow chandlers, are of twTo kinds: the firft for the common dipped candles, being the vef fel wherein the melted tallow is difpofed, and the wick dipped. This is of wood, of a triangular form, and fupported on one of its angles; fo that it has an open ing of near a foot a-top : the other, ufed in the fabric of mould candles, is of brafs, pewter, or tin.—Here each candle has its feveral mould. See Candle. Mould, among gol^-beatersT1 a certain number of leaves of vellum or pieces of gut, cut fquare, of a cer tain fize, and laid over one another, between which they put the leaves of gold and filver which they beat on the marble with the hammer, See Gold leaf. They have four kinds of moulds j two whereof are of vellum and two of gut : the fmallelt of thofe of vellum confifts of 40 or 50 leaves j the largelt contains 100 : for the others, each contains 500 leaves. The moulds have all their feveral cafes, confiding of two pieces of parchment, ferving to keep the leaves of the mould in their place, and prevent their being diforder- ed in beating. Mould, in Agriculture, a general name for the foft earthy fubftance with which the dry land is generally covered, and in which all kinds of vegetables take root and grown It is far from being an homogeneous fub ftance 5 being compofed of decayed animal and vege table matters, along with calcareous, argillaceous, and filiceous earths, mixed together in various proportions, and with the different degrees of moiftme, conftituting every variety of soil.

HORIZONTAL,"something that relates to the horizon, is taken in the horizon, or on a level with the horizon.—We say, a horizontal planet horizontal line, &c. Horizontal Dial, is that drawn on a parallel to the horizon : having its gnomon, or style, elevated accord ing to the altitude of the pole of the place for which it is designed. Horizontal dials are, of all others, the most simple and easy. The manner of descrining them, see under the article Dial. Horizontal Line, in Perspective, is a right line drawn through the principal point, parallel to the ho rizon : or, it is the intersection of the horizontal and perspective planes. See Perspective. Horizontal Plane, is that which is parallel to the horizon of the place, or nothing inclined thereto. The business of levelling is to find whether two points be in the horizontal plane ; or how much the deviation is. See Levelling.

LADY,"This title is derived from two Saxon words, which signify loaf-day^ which words have in time been contracted into the present appellation. It properly belongs only to the daughters of earls, and all of higher rank ; but custom has made it a word of complaisance for the wives of knights and of all emi nent women. As to the original application of this expression, it may be observed, that heretofore it was the fashion for those families, whom God had blessed with affluence, to live constantly at their mansion houses in the coun try, and that once a-week, or oftener, the lady of the manor distrinuted to her poor neighbours, xvith her own hands, a certain quantity of bread ; but the prac tice, which gave rise to this title is now as little known as the meaning of it ; however, it may be from that hospitable custom, that to this day the ladies in this kingdom alone serve the meat at their own table.

MOULD,"or Mold, in the mechanic arts, &c. a cavity artificially cut, with a design to give its form or impression to some softer matter applied therein. Moulds are implements of great use in sculpture, foundery, &c. The workmen employed in melting the mineral or metallic ore dug out of mines, have their several moulds to receive the melted metal as it comes out of the fur nace but these are different according to the diversity of metals and works. In gold mines, they have moulds for ingots; in silver mines, for bars ; in copper and lead mines, for pigs or salmons j in tin mines, for pigs and ingots; and in iron mines, for sows, chimney backs, anvils, caldrons, pots, and other large utensils and mer chandises of iron 5 which are here cast, as it were, at first hand. Moulds of founders of large works, as statues, bells, guns, and other brazen works, are of wax, supported within-side by what we call a core, and covered with- outside with a cape or case. It is in the space which the wax took up, which is afterwards melted away to leave it free, that the liquid metal runs, and the work ] M O U is formed ; being carried thither through a great nurn- Moulds ber of little canals, which cover the whole mould. See v— Foundery. Moulds of moneyers are frames full of sand, where in the plates of metal are cast that are to serve for the striking of species of gold and silver. See Coining. A sort of concave moulds made of clay, having wdthin them the figures and inscriptions of ancient Homan coins, are found in many parts of England, and supposed to have been used for the casting of money. Mr Baker having been favoured with a sight of some of these moulds found in Shropshire, bearing the same types and inscriptions with some of the Roman coins, gave an account of them to the Royal Society. They were found in digging of sand, at a place called Ryton in Shropshire, about a mile from the great Watling- street road. They are all of the size of the Roman de narius, and of little more than the thickness of our halfpenny. They are made of a smooth pot or brick clay, which seems to have been first w'ell cleansed from dirt and sand, and well beaten or kneaded, to render it fit for taking a fair impression. There were a great many of them found together, and there are of them not unfrequently found in Yorkshire 5 but they do not seem to have been met with in any other kingdom, ex cept that some have been said to be once found at Lyons. They have been sometimes found in great numbers joined together side by side, on one flat piece ot clay, as if intended for the casting of a great num ber of coins at once j and both these, and all the others that have been found, seem to have been of fhe empe ror Severus. They are sometimes found impressed on both sides, and some have the head of Severus on one side and some well known reverse of his on the other. They seem plainly to have been intended for the coin age of money, though it is not easy to say in what manner they can have been employed for that purpose, especially those which have impressions on both sides, • unless it may be supposed that they coined two pieces at the same time by the help of three moulds, of which this was to be the middle one. If by disposing these into some sort of iron frame or case, as our letter- founders do the brass moulds for casting their types, the melted metal could be easily poured into them, it would certainly be a very easy method of coining, as such moulds require little time or expence to make, and therefore might be supplied with new ones as often as they happen to break. These moulds seem to have been burnt or baked sufficiently to make them hard ; but not so as to ren der them porous like our bricks, whereby they would have lost their smooth and even surface, which in these is plainly so close, that whatever metal should be form ed in them would have no appearance like the sand- holes by winch counterfeit coins and metals are usually detected. Moulds of founders of small wrorks are like the frames of coiners: it is in these frames, which are likewise filled with sand, that their several works are fashioned ; into which, when the two frames of which the mould is composed, are rejoined, the melted brass Moulds of letter-founders are parly of steel and partly of wood. The wood, properly speaking, serves only to cover the real mould which is within, and to 3 N 2 prevent M O U [ 468 ] M O U Moulds prevent the woi'kman, who holds it in lus hand, from  r—1 being incommoded by the heat ot the melted metal. Only one letter or type can be formed at once in each mould. See Letter Foundery. Moulds, in the manufacture of paper, are little frames composed of several brass or iron wires, fasten ed together by another wire still liner. Each mould is of the bigness of the sheet of paper to be made, and has a rim or ledge of wood to which the wires are fastened. These moulds are more usually called frames or forms. See Paper-Making. Moulds, with furnace and crucinle makers,are made of wood, of the same form with the crucinles ; that is, in form of a truncated cone : they have handles of wood to hold and turn them with, when being covered with the earth, the workman has a mind to round or flatten his vessel. Moulds for leaden bullets are little iron pincers, each of whose branches terminates in a hemispherical concave, which when shut from an entire sphere. In the lips or sides where the branches meet is a little jet or hole, through which the melted lead is conveyed. Laboratory Moulds are made of wood, for filling and driving all sorts of rockets and cartridges, &c. Glaziers Moulds. The glaziers have two kinds of moulds, both serving to cast their lead: in the one they cast the lead into long rods or canes fit to be drawn through the vice, and the grooves formed therein ; this they sometimes call ingot-mould. In the other, they mould those little pieces of lead a line thick and two lines broad, fastened to the iron bars. Ihese may he also cast in the vice. Goldsmiths Moulds. The goldsmiths use the bones of the cuttle fish to make moulds for their small works j which they do by pressing the pattern between two bones, and leaving a jet or hole to convey the metal through, after the pattern has been taken out. Mould, among masons, is a piece of hard wood or iron hollowed within side, answerable to the contours of the mouldings or cornices, &c. to be formed. rlhis is otherw'ise caliner. Moulds, among plumbers, are the tables on which they cast sheets of lead. These they sometimes call simply tables. Besides which they have other real moulds, wherewith they cast pipes without soldering. See each descrined under Plumbery. Moulds, among the glass grinders, are wooden frames, whereon they make the tubes wherewith they fit their perspectives, telescopes, and other optic ma chines. These moulds are cylinders, of a length and diameter according to the use they are to be applied to, but always thicker at one end than the other, to facili tate the sliding. The tubes made on these moulds are of two kinds *, the one simply of pasteboard and paper 5 the other of thin leaves of wood joined to the paste board. To make these tubes to draw out, only the last or innermost is formed on the mould ; each tube made . afterwards serving as a mould to that which is to go over it, but without taking out the mould from the first. See Grinding. Moulds used in basket-making are very simple, con sisting ordinarily of a willow or osier turned or bent in to an oval, circle, square, or other figux-e, according to the baskets, panniers, hampers, and other utensils in tended. On these moulds they make, or more properly measure all their work •, and accordingly they have Moinh ||i- them of all siz§s, shapes, &c."
ROCK,"a large mass of stone. See Geology. Rock., a species of Vulture. See Ornithology Index. Rock Basons are cavities or artificial basons of diffe rent sizes, from six feet to a few inches diameter, cut in the surface of the rocks for the purpose, as is sup posed, of collecting the dew and rain pure as it de scended from the heavens, for the me of ablutions and purifications, prescrined in the druidical religion; these, especially the dew, being deemed the purest of all fluids. There are two sorts of these basons, one with lips or communications between the different basons, the other simple cavities. The lips as low as the bot tom of the basons, which are horizontal, and commu nicate with one somewhat lower, so contrived that the contents fell by a gradual descentthroughasuccessionof basons either to the ground, or into a vessel set to re ceive it. The basons without lips might be intended for leservoirs to preserve the rain or dew in its original purity without touching any other vessel, and was per haps used for the druid to drink, or wash his hands, previous to officiating at any high ceremony, or else to mix with their misletoe. Some of these basons are so formed as to receive the head and part of the human body; one of this kind is found on a rock called King Arthur’s Bed, in the parish of North Hall in Cornwall, where are also others, call ed by the country people Arthur’s troughs, in which they say he used to feed his dogs.

IONIC,"rder. See Architecture. Ionic Sect, The, was the oldest of the ancient schools of philosophy. It originated in Asia Minor, under Thales of Miletus, about 600 b.c. Its most famous leaders after Thales were Anaximander of Miletus, Pherecydes of Syra, Anaximenes of Miletus, Heraclitus of Ephesus, Anaxagoras and Hermotimus of Clazomenae, and Diogenes of Apollonia. From Asia Minor the spirit of the Ionic philosophy passed into Greece, at first with Anaxagoras, and afterwards with Archelaus, the master of Socrates. Thus Athens, taught from Ionia, became in turn the headquarters of philosophy, and the parent of the most celebrated Greek schools. The interval between Thales and Archelaus embraced a period of about 150 years. The philosophers of the Ionic school directed their attention principally to physics and morals. A few only of their principles and beliefs can now be ascer tained from the fragments which have come down to us. In mental philosophy Pherecydes broached the doctrine of the immortality of the soul; Heraclitus speculated on the nature of the difference between the sleeping and waking state of an intellectual being, and on the individual sense,_ as distinct from general reason, the latter being the seat of all truth, the former of all error. Anaxagoras first drew the line of distinction between spirit and matter, and drew at tention to the regulative faculty in man. In physiology the great question which the Ionic philoso- 1 Unless we take as a proof of it, that sometimes a legislator who returns home, after giving obnoxious votes, is pelted wit emon by his displeased constituents. 2 Parliamentary Papers : Ionian Islands.

Thales believed in v one—water; Pherecydes in earth ; Anaximenes and Dio genes in air; and Heraclitus in fire. Archelaus believed in two—heat and cold, as represented by fire and water Those who believed in a plurality of elements, whether two or more, considered the mechanical action of these upon each other as sufficient to account for the existing state of things ; whereas those who admitted only one were obli°-ed to endow it with a principle of vitality and development to account for existing variety. The latter of these schemes is known as the dynamical theory, the former as the me chanical. Ijlut the labours of the Ionic philosophers were not confined to such speculations. Thales made such ob servations in astronomy as enabled him to calculate eclipses ; Anaximander and Anaximenes constructed sundials and maps; Heraclitus endeavoured to explain the causes of eclipses, and of the successions of the seasons ; while Anaxa goras turned his attention to the milky way, comets, winds, thunder, meteoric stones, &c. These labours of the Ionic- philosophers cleared the way for all those schools which, at a later period, undertook to explain the physical world, and served at once as a model and a starting point for Leucip pus, Democritus, Empedocles, Aristotle, and, finally, for Epicurus. In fact, most of the schools which arose in Greece, from the time of Thales to that of Socrates (b.c. 600 to b.c. 400), and constituted the first philosophic period, were in some sort so many offshoots from the Ionic philoso phy. Pythagoras, born at Samos, became the pupil of Phere cydes ; Xenophanes, the founder of the Eleatic school, was a native of Colophon ; Abdera, the birth-place of Leucip pus and Democritus, and the seat of the school which they founded, was a colony from Phocaea; and, besides, Demo critus was the pupil of Anaxagoras. In the course of its development the Ionic school was contemporary with the Abderitan and Eleatic systems, as also with that of Empe docles and Pythagoras. The first of these philosophies oc cupied itself with nearly the same questions as the thinkers of Ionia. Empedocles admitted, as the first principles of things, the elements of fire, water, earth, and air, thus at tempting to harmonize the opinions of Heraclitus, Thales, Pherecydes, Anaximenes, and Diogenes. The Pythago rean and Eleatic schools, on the other hand, were hostile°to it. They were the idealists of that early period, and, con sequently, in direct antagonism to the materialistic views of the Ionic philosophy. See Thales, Anaximander, &c."
