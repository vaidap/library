Welcome to the world of Encyclopaedia Britannica!

Before designing the game, we know it was hard to show so much text information in such a micro-game, 
so we chose to filter some data that we want players to know, which should be the most general but little-known things.
We want people know more about the history background of the publication of encyclopaedia britannica! So we added some 
related historical pictures for you to expore!
The game is a guided tour, also a timeline. When playing, you can find the publication of edition 1 was followed by the first industrial revolution and Scottish enlightenment. After meeting the Jump Graph level, the player can jump on each pad where there are secret bounce pads so that they can reach a fixed height. For showing the data, we give the character a trail after him and we can get a bar chart after jumping. 



Enjoy!
