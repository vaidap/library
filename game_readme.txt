Welcome to the world of Encyclopaedia Britannica!

Before designing the game, we know it was hard to show so much text information in such a micro-game, 
so we chose to filter some data that we want players to know, which should be the most general but little-known things.
We want people know more about the history background of the publication of encyclopaedia britannica! So we added some 
related historical pictures for you to expore!

Enjoy!
