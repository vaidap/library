^iege‘ 1" IEGE, a bifhoprii of Germany, in the circle of
“_'v 1. a Weftphalia j bounded to the north by Brabant, to
the fouth by Champagne and Luxemburg, to the eaft by
Limburg and Juliers, and to the well by Brabant,
Namur, and Hainault. It is very unequal both in
length and breadth j the former being in fome places
above go miles, in others not half fo much ; and the
latter in fome places 45, in others hardly 25. The
air here is very temperate 5 and the foil fruitful in
corn, v/ine, wood, and pallure. Here alfo are mines
of lead and iron, pits of coal, quarries of marble and
done, and fome celebrated mineral waters, as thofe
of Spa and Chau-fontaine. "I he principal rivers are,
the Maes and Sambre. The manufactures and com¬
modities of the country are chiedy beer, arms, nails,
ierge, leather, with the produCls we have juft men¬
tioned. The ftates of the bilhopric are compofed of
three bodies : the firft is the chapter of Liege j the
feccnd, the nobility of the country 5 and the third, the
deputies of the capital and the other towns. The
three eftates are feldom called together, except to
raife taxes for the fervice of the province, or upon
fome particular emergency ; but there is a committee
of the dates, who meet thrice a-week, and in time of
war daily. They are always about the prince-bilhop,
to make remonilrances, and demand the redrefs of
grievances. The bilhop is fpiritual and temporal lord
of the whole country ; but, as bilhop, is fuftragan to
the archbilhop of Cologne. He ftyles himfelf, by the
grace of God, hi/hop and prince of Liege, duke of Bouil¬
lon, marquis of Franchimont, count of Look, Hoorn, &c.
His arms for Liege are, a pillar argent, on a pedeftal
of the fame, with a crown or, in a field ruby. In the
matricula he was formerly rated at 50 horfe and 170
foot; or j 280 florins monthly, in lieu of them, but
now only at 826. An abatement of one-third has alfo
been granted of the ancient afleffment to the chamber-
court, which was 360 rix-dollars 624- kruitzers for each
term. Here are feveral colleges which fit at Liege, for
the government of the country, and the deciiion of
caules, civil, criminal, fpiritual, and feudal, and of
Inch aKo as relate to the finances. The chapter con-
fills of 60 perfons, who mull either prove their nobility
for four generations, both by father and mother, be¬
fore they can be admitted : or if they cannot do that,
rnufi at leaft have been doftors or licentiates of divi¬
nity for feven years, or, of lawT, for five years, in fome
famous univerlity. Ihe bifhopric is very populous

Liege, the capital of the bifhopric of the fame
name, Hands upon the Maes, in a fine valley, fur-
rounded with woods and hills, being a free imperial
city, and one of the largeft and mofl eminent in Europe.
Though it is 100 miles from the fea by water, the
Maes is navigable up to it. The city has 16 gates j
17 bridges, fome of them very handfome ; 154 ilreets,
many of them ftraight and broad ; a fine epifcopal
palace ; a very large {lately cathedral, in which, be¬
fides five great filver coffers full of relics, are feveral
filver ftatues of faints, and a St George on horfeback
of malfy gold, prefented to the cathedral by Charles
the Bold, by way of atonement for ufing the inhabit¬
ants cruelly in the year 1468. Of the other churches,
that of St Paul is the moil remarkable, both for its
ftructure and fine ornaments in painting and marble.
The city is well fortified, and there are alfo two
caftles on the mountain of the Holy Walburg for its
defence. Befides a great number of other convents of
both fexes, here is a college of Englifh'Jefuits, found¬
ed in the year 1616, and a fine nunnery of Engliih
ladies. Indeed, churches, convents, and other reli¬
gious foundations, take up the greater part of it.
The reader, therefore, no doubt, will take it for
granted, that it is a moft bleffed, holy, and happy
city. But however it may fare with the profane, un¬
hallowed laity, it is certainly the paradife of priefts,
as it is exprefsly called, by way of eminence. It is
divided into the old and new, or the upper and lower;
and the latter again into the ifland, and the quarter
beyond the Maes. The houfes are high, and built
of bluifh marble. In the town and fuburbs are 12
public places or fquares, 10 hofpitals, a beguin-houfe,
and two fine quays, planted with feveral rows of trees,
for the burghers to take the air j but a great part of
that within the walls is taken up with orchards and
vineyards. The manufadtures of this city are arms,
nails, leather, ferge, and beer. In St William’s
convent, without the city, is the tomb of the famous
Englilh traveller Sir John Mandeville, with an infcrip-
tion in barbarous French, requefting thofe who read it
to pray for his foul. Near it are kept the faddle,
fpurs, and knife, that he made ufe of in his travels.
A After
LIE [2
After having feen inoft of the cities of any note in the
world, he made choice of this to fpend the eve of his
life in. A little way from the city, on the other fide
of the Maes, ftands the epifcopal palace of Seraing, in
which the bifhops generally refide during the fummer.
The latitude of this city is 50. 36. N. and the longitude
5. 40. E. .
Some difturbances took place here in the year 1789,
in confequence of certain difputes that had arifen be¬
tween the prince-biihop and the inhabitants. The lat¬
ter having demanded certain privileges, which he did
not think proper to grant, they took up arms, and com¬
pelled him and his chapter to comply with their re-
queft. The prince, together with many of the clergy,
nobility, and citizens, alarmed by this commotion, and
dreading the confequences of popular fury, which when
once roufed feldom knows any bounds, fought fafety by
a voluntary exile. They then appealed to the imperial
chamber j and this tribunal, inftead of afting the part
of arbiter*, dee*ided as a fovereign, and ordered the cir¬
cles of the Lower Rhine and Weftphalia to execute the
fentence.
The king of Prufiia, at whole court one of the chiefs
of the infurre&ion had refided, and who wilhed to gain
a party at Liege, became mediator *, and feemed to fa¬
vour the Liegoife, many of w'hofe claims were juft,
though they attempted to enforce them by violence
and the moft illegal fteps. Intoxicated with this pro-
te&ion, the people of Liege treated the remonftrances
of their bilhop, the decrees of the imperial chamber,
and the refolutions of the dire&ory of the two circles,
with the utmoft contempt; and proceeded fo far as
even to dethrone their prince, by appointing a regent
in the perfon of a French prelate. The ele&oral col¬
lege having deliberated on the belt means of putting
an end to thefe difturbances, its propofitions, though
modified by M. Dohm the Pruflian plenipotentiary,
made the infurgents break out into open fedition. De¬
luded by their leaders, they gave themfelves up every
day to new exceffes $ the effe&s of the citizens were
expofed to pillage, and their perfons to infult. The
king of Pruflia, who was defirous to bring matters to
an accommodation, and not to inftigate the Liegoife to
become independent, finding that the efforts of his
minifter were not attended with the defired fuccefs,
feemed unwilling to interfere an^ farther in an affair
which might have led him into a quarrel with the em¬
pire. The executive troops, at the fame time, re¬
mained almoft in a ftate of inactivity •, and feemed ra¬
ther to guard the frontiers of this petty ftate, than to
make any attempt to reduce it to obedience. Neither
this conduCt, however, nor the exhortations of Pruflia,
added to the moral certainty of their being foon com¬
pelled to lay down their arms, made any change in the
conduCt of the malecontents. They declared openly,
in the face of all Europe, that they would either con¬
quer or die 5 and they perfifted in this refolution, w’hile
commerce, manufactures, and the public revenues,
were going daily to decay.
Having at length openly attacked the executive
forces without the territories of their city, the emperor
could no longer remain an indifferent fpeftator. It
was now full time to put a period to that madnefs to
which the people had abandoned themfelves $ and to
accomplifh this in . an effeCLial. manner, the imperial
] LIE
chamber at Wetzlar requefted the emperor, as a mem-
ber of the ancient circle of Burgundy, to execute its Lienter
orders refpeCling this objeCt. In confequence of this
meafure, Baron Alvinzi, who commanded a body of
Auftrians cantoned in Limburg and the confines of
Brabant, notified, by order of Marfhal Bender, to
the ftates and municipality of Liege, that the em¬
peror intended to fend troops into their city and terri¬
tories, for the purpofe of reftoring tranquillity and
good order. The ftates had already been informed of
this refolution by their agent at Wetzlar. They there¬
fore wrote to Marftial Bender, to affure him of the
refpeClful confidence which they placed in the juftice
and magnanimity of the emperor, and to requeft that
the Auftrian troops might enter alone, without thofe of
the eleftors j and that they might be confined to occu¬
py the gates and the fuburbs only. To this letter,
which was carried to Bruffels by a deputation of the
ftates, Marlhal Bender returned a very fatisfaClory an-
fwer, relating to the difpofition of the electoral troops :
but Baron Alvinzi, in a note which he w’rote to the
ftates, infifted among other articles, that all the citi¬
zens fhould throw down their arms ; that proper accom¬
modations fhould be prepared for the officers and men j
that the warlike ftores, collected for making refiftance,
fhould be removed \ and that cockades, and every other
diftinCtive mark of the like kind, ftiould be laid afide
before the arrival of the imperial troops. However
humiliating thefe preliminaries might be, efpecially
that of a general difarming, the ftates and municipali¬
ties acquiefced w’ithout the leaft referve •, and their fub-
miffion, as hidden as complete, was communicated to
the people, with an exhortation to follow' their ex¬
ample.
Notwithftanding this pacific appearance, two days
before the entrance of the imperial troops, the muni¬
cipal council of Liege, flattering themfelves, perhaps,
with the hopes of affiftance from Pruflia, affured the
inhabitants that they would remain unfhaken in their
poft, and that they had fworn never to defert the caufe
in which they were engaged. This, however, did not
prevent the Auftrian troops, to the number of 6000,
from penetrating, without oppofition, into the heart
of the city } where they occupied every poft j made
the citizens lay afide their arms, uniforms, and cock¬
ades ; and in a Angle hour, dethroned fo many fove-
reigns of a year. The greater part of the municipal
officers, who two days before had folemnly promifed
fuch great things, betook themfelves to flight, and re¬
tired either to France or Wefel *, while the ancient
magiftracy, which had been expelled in the month of
Auguft 1789, was provifionally reinftated by the di-
re&orial commiflioners.—The decrees of the imperial
chamber at Wetzlar have fince been executed in their
utmoft extent. The ancient magiftracy and the privy
council of the prince-bifhop have been reftored j and
the prince himfelf having returned, peace and good
order have been re-eftablifhed. The French took this
city in 1792, and eflfe&ed another revolution ; but be¬
ing driven from it in 1793, the citizens w'ere once more
obliged to fubmit.

Lievens, LI EVENS, John or Jan, a celebrated painter, was
Kieou ^>orn at Eeyden in 1607. He difeovered an early in-
‘ 1 olination for the arts, and was the difciple firll: of Jon's
van Schooten, and afterwards of Peter Laftman. He
excelled principally in painting portraits 5 but he alfo
executed feveral hiftorical fubjefts with great fuccefs.
He came over to England, where he refided three
years, and painted the portraits of Charles I. the queen,
the prince of Wales, and feveral of the nobility ; after
which he returned to Antwerp, where he met with
full employment for his pencil. We have feveral etch¬
ings by this mafter, which are performed in a flight,
but mafterly manner. The chiaro feuro is very fkil-
fully managed in them, fo as to produce a moft power¬
ful effedt. His ftyle of etching bears feme refemblance
to that of Rembrandt j but it is coarfer in general, and
lefs finifhed.
LIEOU-KIEOU, the name of certain iflands of
Afia, fubjedf to China j but hitherto little known to
geographers, who have been fatisfied with marking
their exiflence and latitude in their charts. They,
however, form a powerful and extenfive empire, the
inhabitants of which are civilized, and ought not to
be confounded with other favage nations difperfed
throughout the iflands of Afia. Father Gabil, a Je-
fuit, has furnifhed us with fome interefting details re-
fpedling thefe iflanders, which he extradled from a
Chinefe relation, publifhed in 1721, at the end of a
voyage that was undertaken on the follownng account.
The emperor Kang-hi having refolved in 1719, to
fend an ambaflador to the king of Lieou-kieou, chofe
for this purpofe one of the great dodlors of the em¬
pire, named Supao-Koang. This learned man depart¬
ed from China in 1719, and returned to Peking in
1720, where, in the year following, he caufed a rela¬
tion of his voyage to be publiflied in two volumes. It
is in the firft of thefe that he gives an accurate and
particular defeription of the ifles of Lieou-Kieou ; and
what he relates appears to be worthy of the greater cre¬
dit, becaufe, being on the fpot, he examined, as he
himfelf fays, according to the orders of the emperor,
whatever he found curious or interefting, refpefting
the number, fituation, and produ&ions of thefe ifles ;
as alfo the hiftory, religion, manners, and cuftoms of
the people who inhabit them.
Thefe ifles, fituated between Corea, Formofa, and
Japan, are in number 36. The principal and largeft
is called Lieou-Kieou; the reft have each a particular
denomination. The largeft ifland extends from north
to fouth almoft 440 lys, and I 20 or 130 from eaft to
weft ; but on the fouth fide, the extent from eaft to
weft is not 100 lys. The fouth-eaft part of the ifland,
where the court refides, is called Cheou-li; and it is
there that Kint-ching, the capital city, is fituated. The
king’s palace, which is reckoned to be four leagues in
circumference, is built on a neighbouring mountain. It
has four gates, which correfpond to the four cardinal
points j and that which fronts the weft forms the grand
entry. The view which this palace commands is moft
extenfive and delightful j it reaches as far as the port of
Napa-kiang, at the diftance of ten lys, to the city of
Kint ching, and to a great number of other cities,
towns, villages, palaces, temples, monafteries, gardens,
pleafure houfes. It ftands in longitude 146° 26' eaft
and in latitude 26* 2' north.
3 1 L I E
I! we believe thefe iflanders, the origin of their em- Uicra-
pire is loft in the remoteft antiquity. They reckon up . Kieou-
25 fucceffive dynafties, the duration of which forms a
period of more than 18,000 years. It would be ufe-
lefs to employ a ftngle moment in pointing out the ab-
furdity of thefe pretenfions. It is, however, certain,
that the exiftence of the country called Lieou-hieou was
not known in China before the year 605 of the Chrif-
tian era. It was in the courfe of that year, that one
of the emperors of the dynafty of Soui, having heard
of thefe ifles, was defirous of knowing their fituation.
This prince at firft fent fome Chinefe thither but
their expedition proved fruitlefs, as the want of inter¬
preters prevented them from acquiring that knowledge
which was the objeft of their voyage. They only
brought fome of the iflanders with them to Sigan-fou,
the capital of the province of Chen-fi, which was the
ufual refidence of the emperors of the dynafty of S.*-;.
It fortunately happened, that an embaflador of the
king of Japan was then at court. This embaffador
and his attendants immediately knew the ftrangers to
be natives of Lieou-kieou : but they fpoke of thefe
illes as of a miferable and wretched country, the in¬
habitants of which had never been civilized. The em¬
peror of China afterwards learned, that the principal
iiland lay to the eaft of a city called at prefent Fbu-
tcheou-fou, which is the capital of the province of
Fo-kien ; and that, in a paffage of five days, one
might reach the large ifland where the king kept his
court.
On this information, the emperor Yang-ti fent fldl-
ful men, accompanied by interpreters, to fummon the
prince to do homage to the emperor of China, and to
pay him tribute. This propofal was very ill received.
The king of Lieou-kieou fent back the Chinefe, tell¬
ing them fternly, that he acknowledged no prince to
be his fuperior. This anfwer irritated the emperor,
who, to obtain revenge, caufed a fleet to be immediate¬
ly equipped in Fo-kien, in which he embarked x0,000
men. Lhis fleet fet fail, and arrived in fafety at the
port of Napa-kiang. Fhe army, in fpite of every effort
made by the natives, landed on the ifland 5 and the
king, who had put himfelf at the head of his troops to
oppofe the enemy, having fallen in battle, the Chinefe
pillaged, facked, and burnt the royal city, made more
than 5000 Haves, and returned to China.
The emperors of the dynafty of Tang, thofe of the
ftiort dynafties that followed, and thofe of the dynafty
of Song, although they were fully informed of every
thing refpefting the Lieou-kieou ifles, made no at¬
tempts to render them tributary. In 1291, Chi-tfou,
emperor of the dynafty of Yven, was defirous of reviv¬
ing the pretenfions of his predeceffors. He fitted out a
fleet to fubdue thefe iflands; but fchemes of conqueft
had become difagreeable to the Chinefe, fince the dif-
after that befel their army in an expedition againft Ja¬
pan. The fleet of Chi-tfou went no farther than the
ifles of Pong-hou, and the weftern coaft of Formofa,
from whence, under divers pretences, they returned to
the ports of Fo-kien.
It was only in 1372, under the reign of Hong-vou,
founder of the dynafty of Ming, that thefe iflands fub-
mitted voluntarily to the Chinefe government. Hong-
vou had fent one of the grandees of his court to Tfay-
tou, who was then reigning at Lieou-kieou, to inform

liira of his acceffion to the throne. The Chinefe noble-
^ man had received particular inftrudions refpefting this
commiffion, and he acquitted himfelf of it with all the
prudence and add refs of an able minifter. In a private
audience which he had with Tfay-tou, he exhorted
this prince to declare himfelf a tributary of the empire,
and laid before him the advantages he would derive
from this Hep. His reafoning, fupported by the power
of his natural eloquence, made fo much impreflion on
the mind of Tfay-tou, that he embraced the propofal
made him, and fent immediately to the emperor to de¬
mand the inveftiture of his Hates. *
Hong-vou received his envoys in a magnificent man¬
ner, and loaded them with prefents. He folemnly de¬
clared Tfay-tou a vaffal of the empire •, and, after hav¬
ing received his firfl tribute (which conliHed in valuable
horfes, aromatic wood, fulphur, copper, tin, &c. he
lent to this prince a golden feal, and confirmed the
choice he had made of one of his fons for fuc. f .'for.
The emperor afterwards fent 36 families, almoft all
from the province of Fo kien to Lieou-kieou. Tfay-
tou received them, afiigned them lands near the port
of Napa-kiang, and appointed certain revenues for their
ufe, at the fame time that Hong-vou made them con-
liderable icmittances. Thefe families firfl; introduced
into Lieou-kieou the learned language of the Chinele,
the ule of their charaflers, and the ceremonies praclifed
in China in honour of Confucius. On the other hand,
the fons of feveral of the grandees of the court of Tfay-
tou were fent to Nan-king, to ftudy Chinefe in the im¬
perial college, where they were treated with ditlimflion,
and maintained at the emperor’s expences.
The iiles of Lieou-kieou had neither iron nor porce¬
lain. Hong-vou fupplied this want 5 he caufed a great
number of utenlils of iron and inftruments to be made,
which he fent thither, together with a quantity of por¬
celain veiTels. Commerce, navigation, and the arts
foon began to flourilh. Thefe iflanders learned to call
bells for their temples, to manufafture paper and the
fineft fluffs, and to make porcelain, with which they
had been fupplied before from Japan.
The celebrated revolution which placed the Tartars
en the imperial throne of China, produced no change
in the conduft of the kings of Lieou-kieou. Chang-
tcbc, who was then reigning, fent ambaffadors to ac¬
knowledge Chun-tchi, and received a feal from him, on
which were engraven feme Tartar chara&ers. It was
then fettled, that the king of Lieou-kieou fhould pay
his tribute only every two years, and that the number
of perfons in the train of his envoys fhould not exceed
15°;
The emperor Kang-hi feemed to pay more atten¬
tion to theie ifles than any of his predeceffors. He
eaufed a fuperb palace to be erefted in honour of Con¬
fucius, and a college where he maintained mafters to
teach the fciences and the Chinefe charafters. He alfo
inflituted examinations for the different degrees of the
literati. He ordained, that the king of Lieou-kieou
fhould never fend in tribute rofe-wood, cloves, or any
other production which was not really of the growth of
the country ; but that he ihould fend a fixed quantity of
fulphur, copper, tin, fhells, and mother of pearl, which
is remarkably pretty in thefe iflands. He permitted,
that, befides the uiual tribute, he might prefent him
horfe-furniture, piftol-cafes, and other things of the
4 ] LIE
fame kind, which thefe iflanders are faid to manufa&ure
with great tafle and neatnefs.
It is more than 900 years fmee the bonzes of China
introduced at Lieou kieou the vvorftiip of Fo, and the
principal books belonging to their fed!. This worftiip
is at prefent the eftablifhed religion both of the gran¬
dees and of the people. There is ftill to be feen in the
royal city a magnificent temple, ere£ted in honour of
another idol borrowed from the Chinefe, named Tein -fcy,
which fignifies cc/cjlial queen or lady.
Thefe iflanders do not make promifes or fwear be¬
fore their idols. When they have occafion to do this,
they burn perfumes, prefent fruits, and Hand refpecl-
fully before fome ftone, which they call to witnels the
folemnity of their engagements. Numbers of ftones
are to be feen in the courts of their temples, in molt
public places, and upon their mountains, which are en¬
tirely appropriated to this purpofe. They have alfo
among them women confecrated for the worfliip of
fpirits, -who are fuppofed to have great influence over
thefe beings. They vifit the fick, diftribute medicines,
and recite prayers for their recovery.
They refpeft the dead as much as the Chinefe, and
they are no lefs ceremonious in wearing mourning j
but their funerals are neither fo pompous, nor attended
with fo much expence. Their coffins, which are of an
hexagonal or odlagonal figure, are three or four feet
high. They burn the fiefh of the bodies of their dead,
and preferve only the bones. They never offer pro-
vifions to them ; they are contented with placing lamps
round them, and burning perfumes.
Different families are diflinguilhed in Lieou-kieou by
furnames, as in China j but a man and a woman of the
fame furname cannot be united in marriage. The king
is not permitted to marry but in the three grand fami¬
lies, which always enjoy the higheft offices. There is
a fourth, of equal diiiinftion to the three former ; but
neither the king nor the princes contract any alliances
with this family 5 for it is doubtful whether it be not
fprung from the fame ftem as the royal line.
A plurality of wives is allowed in thefe ifles. Young
men and young women enjoy the liberty of feeing one
another, and of converfing together j and their union
is always in confequence of their own choice. The wo¬
men are very referved 5 they never ufe paint, and wear
no pendants in their ears \ they colieft their hair on the
top of their heads in the form of a curl, and fix it in
that manner by means of long pins made of gold or
lilver.
Befides the vaft domains which the king poffeffes, he
receives the produce of all the fulphur, copper, and tin
mines, and of the fait pits, together with what arifes-
from taxes. From thefe revenues he pays the falaries
of the mandarins and officers of his court. Thefe fala¬
ries are eftimated at a certain number of facks of rice $
but under this name is comprehended whatever the
king gives in grain, rice, filk, cloth, &c. The
whole is valued according to the price of the facks of
rice.
There are here, as in China, nine orders of manda¬
rins, who are diftinguiffied by the colour of their caps,
or by their girdles and cufliions. The greater part of
the titles of thefe mandarins are hereditary in their
families ; but there are fome which are only beftowed
upon merit. In the royal city there are tribunals efta-
blithed

There are alfo particular tribunals for civil and criminal
matters ; for whatever concerns the families of the gran¬
dees and princes •, for the affairs of religion ; for in-
fpe&ing the public granaries, king’s revenues, duties j
for commerce, manufa&ures, civil ceremonies, and for
navigation, public edifices, literature, and war.
The veffels that are built in this country are greatly
valued by the people of China and Japan. In thefe
the natives go not only from one illand to another, but
alfo to China, Tong-king, Cochin-China, Corea, Nanga-
za-ki, Satfuma, the neighbouring ifles, and to Formofa,
where they difpofe of their different commodities. Be-
fides thofe articles of commerce which their manufac¬
tures of filk, cotton, paper, arms, copper utenfils, &c.
furnuh them, they alfo export mother-of-pearl, tortoife
and other (hells, coral and whetftones, which are in
great requeft both in China and Japan.
LIEUTAUD, Dr Joseph, counfellor of (late and
firft phylician at the court of France, was born at Aix
In Provence, and refided principally there till he took
the degree of doctor of medicine. After this he profe-
cuted his ftudies for fome years at Montpelier. , He
returned to Aix, where he foon acquired extenfive
practice, and became eminent for literary abilities. He
refided there till the year 1750, when he was invited
to a6t as phyfician to the royal infirmary at Ver-
failles. There he practifed with fuch reputation and
fuccefs, that he foon arrived at the head of his pro-
feffion $ and in tlie year 1774, upon the death of M.
Senac, he was appointed archiater. His extenfive en¬
gagements in practice did not prevent him from culti¬
vating the fcience of medicine in all its branches, and
from freely communicating to others the refult of his
own ftudies. He publifhed many valuable works 5 a-

remarkable. Element a Vhijsiologice. 2. Precis de la

LIEUTENANT, an officer who fupplies the place
and difeharges the office of a fuperior in his abfenefe.
Of thefe, fome are civil, as the lords-lieutenants of
kingdoms, and the lords-lieutenants of counties j and
others are military, as the lieutenant-general, lieutenant-
colonel, &c.
Lord-LiEUTENANT of Ireland, is properly a viceroy ;
and has all the ftate and grandeur of a king of Eng¬
land, except being ferved upon the knee. He has the
power of making war and peace, of beftowing all the
offices under the government, of dubbing knights, and
of pardoning all crimes except high treafon *, he alfo
calls and prorogues the parliament, but no bill can pafs
without the royal affent. He is affifted in his govern¬
ment by a privy council j and, on his leaving the king¬
dom, he appoints the lords of the regency, who govern
in his abfence.
Lords-LiEVTENANTs of Counties, are officers, who
upon any invafion or rebellion, have power to raife
the militia, and to give commiflions to colonels and
other officers, to arm and form them into regiments,
troops, and companies. Under the lords-lieutenants,
; 1 lie
are deputy-lieutenants, who have the fame power; Lieute
thefe are chofen by the lords-lieutenants, out of the
principal gentlemen of each county, Slid prefented to
the king for his approbation. ,

Lieutenant, in the land fervice, is the fecond
commiffioned officer in every company of both foot
and horfe, and next to the captain, and who takes the
command upon the death or abfence of the captain.
Lieutenant of Artillery. Each company of ar¬
tillery hath four; 1 firft and 3 fecond lieutenants.
The firft lieutenant hath the fame detail of duty v;ith
the captain, becaufe in his abfence he commands the
company : he is to fee that the foldiers are clean and
neat; that their clothes, arms, and accoutrements, are
in good and ferviceable order; and to wTatch over every
thing elfe which may contribute to their health. He
muft give attention to their being taught the exercife,
fee them pun&ually paid, their meffes regularly kept,
and to vifit them in the hofpitals when fick. He muft:
aflift at all parades, &c. He ought to underhand the
do&rine of proje&iles and the fcience of artillery, with
the various eft'e<fts of gunpowder, however managed
or dire&ed j to enable him to conftruft and difpofe.
his batteries to the beft advantage; to plant his can¬
non, mortars, and howitzers, (b as to produce the
greateft annoyance to an enemy. He is to be well
(killed in the attack and defence of fortified places j
and to be converfant in arithmetic, mathematics, me¬
chanics, &c.
Second Lieutenant in the Artillery, is the fame as
an enfign in an infantry regiment, being the youngeft
commulioned officer in the company, and muft affift
the firft lieutenant in the detail of the company’s duty.
His other qualifications (hould be equal with thofe of
the firft lieutenant.
Lieutenant of a Ship of War, the officer next in
rank and power to the captain, in whofe abfence he is
accordingly charged with the command of the (hip, as
alfo the execution of whatever orders he may have re ¬
ceived from the commander relating to the king’s fer¬
vice.
The lieutenant who commands the watch at fea,
keeps a lift of all the officers and men thereto belong¬
ing, in order to mufter them when he judges it expe¬
dient, and report to the captain the names of thofe
who are abfent from their duty. During the night
watch, he occafionally vifi^s the lower decks, or fends
thither a careful officer, to fee that the proper centinels
are at their duty, and that there is no diforder amongft
the men •, no tobacco fmoked between decks, nor any
fire or candles burning there, except the lights which
are in lanthorns, under the care of a proper watch, on
particular occafions. He is expetled to be always up¬
on deck in his watch, as well to give the neceffary or¬
ders with regard to trimming the fails and fuperintend-
ing the navigation, as to prevent any noife or con-
fufion j but he is never to change the fhip’s courfe with¬
out the captain’s diredlions, unlefs to avoid an im¬
mediate danger.
The lieutenant, in time of battle, is particularly to
fee that all the men are prefent at their quarters
where they have been previoufly ftationed according
to the, regulations made by the captain. He orders
and
L I F [6
and exhorts them everywhere to perform their duty,
and acquaints the captain at all other times of the mif-
behaviour of any perlon in the fhip, and of whatever
elfe concerns the fervice or difcipline.
The youngeft lieutenant in the fhip, who is alfo
ft'yled lieutenant at arms, befides his common duty, is
particularly ordered, by his inftruftions, to train the
feamen to the ufe of fmall arms, and frequently to ex-
ercife and dilcipline them therein. Accordingly his
office, in time of battle, is chiefly to direft and attend
them ^ and at all other times to have a due regard to
the prefervation of the fmall arms, that they be not loft
or embezzled, and that they are kept clean and in good
condition for fervice.
LiEUTENANV-Reformed, he whofe company or troop
is broke or difbanded, but continued in whole or half
pay, and ftill preferves his right of feniority and rank
in the army.
LIFE, is peculiarly ufed to denote the animated
ftate of living creatures, or the time that the union of
their foul and body lafts.
The Prolongation of Life is made by Lord Bacon one
of the three branches of medicine •, the other two re¬
lating to the prefervation of health, and the cure of
difeafes. See Medicine.
The theory of prolonging life he numbers among the
defiderata. Some means or indications that feem to
lead to it, he lays down as follow :
Things are preferved in two manners; either in their
identity, or by reparation. In their identity; as a fly or
ant in amber ; a flower, or fruit, or wood, in a con-
fervatory of fnow; a dead carcafe in balfams. By
reparation; as a flame, or a mechanical engine, &c. To
attain to the prolongation of life, both thefe methods
muft be ufed. And hence, according to him, arife
three intentions for the prolongation of life ; Retarda¬
tion of confumption, proper reparation, and renovation
of what begins to grow old.
Confumption is occafioned by two kinds of depreda¬
tion ; a depredation of the innate fpirit, and a depre¬
dation of the ambient air. Thefe may be each pre¬
vented two ways; either by rendering thofe agents lefs
predatory, or by rendering the paffive parts (viz. the
juices of the body), lefs liable to be preyed on. The
fpirit -will be rendered lefs predatory, if either its fub-
ftance be condenfed, as by the ufe of opiates, grief,
&c.; or its quantity diminifhed, as in fpare and mo-
naftic diets; or its motion calmed, as in idlenefs and
tranquillity. The ambient air becomes lefs predatory,
if it be either lefs heated by the rays of the fun, as in
cold climates, in caves, mountains, and anchorets cells;
or be kept off from the body, as by a denfe fkin, the
feathers of birds, and the ufe of oils and unguents with¬
out aromatics. The juices of the body are rendered
lefs liable to be preyed on, either by making them
harder or more moift and oily; harder, as by a coarfe
fharp diet, living in the cold, robuft exercifes, and fome
mineral baths : nioifter, as by the ufe of fweet foods,
&c. abftaining from falts and acids; and efpecially by
fhch a mixture of drink as conflfts wholly of fine fub-
tile particles, without any acrimony or acidity.
Reparation is performed by means of aliment; and
alimentation is promoted four ways: By the concoftion
of the vifcera, fo as to extrude the aliment: By exciting
the exterior parts to the attra&ion of the aliment; as
] L I F
in proper exercifes and frications, and fome unflions
and baths; By the preparation of the food itfelf, fo
as it may more eafily infinuate itfelf, and in fome mea-
fure anticipate the digeftion ; as in various ways of
dreffing meats, mixing driilks, fermenting breads, and
reducing the virtues of thefe three into one : By pro¬
moting the aft of affimilation itfelf, as in feafonable
fleep, fome external application, &c.
The renovation of what begins to grow' old, is per¬
formed tw7o ways : By the inteneration of the habit of
the body ; as in the ufe of emollients, emplafters, unc¬
tions, &c. of fuch a nature, as do not extraft but im-
prefs: Or by purging off the old juices, and fubftitut-
ing freffi ones; as in feafonable evacuations, attenuat¬
ing diets, &c.
The fame author adds thefe three axioms : That the
prolongation of life is to be expefted, rather from fome
ftated diets, than either from any ordinary regimen or
any extraordinary medicines; more from operating on
the fpirits, and mollifying the parts, than from the
manner of feeding ; and this mollifying of the parts
wdthout is to be performed by fubftantials, impriments,
and occludents. See Longevity.
Life Boat, a moft important invention, confifting in
an improvement of the ordinary conftruftion of a boat,
by which it cannot be funk in the rougheft fea; fo that
it is peculiarly fitted for bringing off mariners from
wrecks during a ftorm, and thus faving many valuable
lives. The life-boat was firft conceived at South Shields,
in the county of Durham. A committee of the inha¬
bitants of that town, who had often been the fad wit-
neffes of many melancholy (hipwrecks in w'hich by the
ordinary means no relief could be given, in a public ad-
vertifement requefted information on this fubjeft, with
models of boats which would be moft proper for the
purpofe of faving perfons from fliipwreck. The com¬
mittee it would appear, employed Mr Greathead, a
boat-builder in South Shields, who had with others
prefented the model of a boat for this purpofe, to build
the firft boat, which upon trial was found fully to an-
fwer the purpofe. Two claimants have fince appeared
for the honour of the invention, which according to
Mr Fades, the chairman of the committee, in his letter
to Mr Hails the fupporter of one claim, belongs to two
of the members themfelves, namely Mr Fades himfelf
and Mr Rockwood. The claimants above alluded to
are Mr Greathead, and a Mr Wouldhave a painter in
South Shields, and a very ingenious man, who alfo pre¬
fented a model to the committee. The claim of the latter
is keenly fupported by Mr Hails, in a pamphlet publilhed
in 1806, two years after Mr Greathead’s pamphlet con¬
taining the hiftory and progrefs of the invention, and of
the boats which he had built for the purpofe, his applica¬
tion to parliament, and the premium of 1200I. which he
received for the invention, &c. and four years after this
application to parliament. It is true that in 1802,
Mr Wouldhave and his friends afferted his claim in the
Monthly Magazine and in fome provincial newfpapers;
but ftill this was one year after Mr Greathead’s appli¬
cation for reward was made to parliament. But, with¬
out being at all underftood to decide to whom the
merit of the invention is due, we (hall leave it to
our readers to examine the evidence for themfelves, and
fhall now proceed to give an account of the conftruc-
tion of the life-boat, of which 31 have been built by
Mr
L 1 f r :
Life-Boat. Mr Greathead, and fent to different parts of Britain,
' tind the north of Europe. The following conltrudHon
is according to Mr Greathead’s plan :
“ The length thirty feet; the breadth ten feet j the
depth, from the top of the gunwale to the lower part
of the keel in midlhips, three feet four inches j from the
gunwale to the platform (within) two feet four inches *,
from the top of the Hems (both ends being fimilar) to
the bottom of the keel, five feet nine inches. The keel
is a plank of three inches thick, of a proportionate
breadth in midlhips, narrowing gradually toward the
ends, to the breadth of the Items at the bottom, and
forming a great convexity downward ; the Hems are
fegments of a circle with confiderable rakes; the bot¬
tom fedtion, to the floor heads, is a curve fore and aft
with the fwTeep of the keel j the floor timber has a fmall
rife curving from the keel to the floor heads 5 a bilge
plank is wrought in on each fide next the floor heads,
with a double rabbit or groove of a fimilar thicknefs
with the keel, and on the outfide of this are fixed two
bilge-trees correfponding nearly with the level of the
keel 5 the ends of the bottom fe&ion form that fine
kind of entrance obfervable in the lower part of the
bow of the fifhing boat called a coble, much ufed in the
north •, from this part to the top of the- ftem, it is more
elliptical, forming a confiderable projection ; the fides
from the floor heads to the top of the gunwale, flaunch
off on each fide, in proportion to about half the breadth
of the floor ; the breadth is continued far forward to¬
ward the ends, leaving a fufficient length of ftraight
fide at the top ; the ftieer is regular along the ftraight
fide, and more elevated toward the ends j the gunwale
fixed on the outfide is three inches thick j the fides,
from the under part of the gunwale along the whole
length of the regular ftieer, extending twrenty-one feet
fix inches, are cafed with layers of cork, to the depth
of 16 inches downward •, and the thicknefs of this cafing
of cork being four inches, it proje&s at the top a little
without the gunwale ; the cork on the outfide is fecured
with thin plates or flips of copper, and the boat is fa-
ftened with copper nails ; the thwarts (or feats) are five
in number, double banked, confequently the boat may
be rowed with ten oars; the thwarts are firmly ftan-
chioned ; the fide oars are ftiort (a), with iron tholes,
and rope grommets, fo that the rower can pull either
w^ay. The boat is fleered with an oar at each end ; and
the fleering oar is one-third longer than the rowing
oar ; the platform placed at the bottom within the boat,
is horizontal the length of the midfhips, and elevated at
the ends, for the convenience of the fteerman, to give
him a greater power with the oar. The internal part
of the boat next the fides, from the under part of the
thwarts down to the platform, is cafed with cork ; the
whole quantity of which, affixed to the life-boat, is
nearly feven hundred weight ; the cork indifputably
contributes much to the buoyancy of the boat when
full of water, is a good defence when going alongfide a
veffel, and is of principal ufe in keeping the boat in an
ere£l pofition in the fea, or rather of giving her a very
] LIE
lively and quick difpofition to recover from any fudden Life-
cant or lurch which fhe may receive from the ftroke of '
a heavy wave : but, exclufive of the cork, the admi¬
rable conftru£lion of this boat gives it a decided pre¬
eminence. The ends being fimilar, the boat can be
rowed either w7ay,- and. this peculiarity of form allevi¬
ates her in rifing over the waves ; the curvature of the
keel and bottom facilitates her movement in turning,
and contributes to the eafe of the fteerage, as a Angle
ftroke of the fleering oar has an immediate effedl, the
boat moving as it were upon a centre ; the fine en¬
trance below is of ufe in dividing the waves, when
rowing againft them ; and combined with the convexi¬
ty of the bottom and the elliptical form of the ftem,
admits her to rife with wonderful buoyancy in a high
fea, and to launch forward with rapidity, without (hip¬
ping any water, when a common boat would be in dan¬
ger of being filled. The flaunching or fpreading form
of the boat, from the floor heads to the gunwale, gives
her a confiderable bearing; and the continuation of the
breadth w'ell forward, is a great fupport to her in the
fea ; and it has been found by experience that boats of
this conllrudlion are the beft fea boats for rowing a-
gainft the turbulent waves. The internal (hallownefs
of the boat from the gunwale down to the platform, the
convexity of the form, and the bulk of cork within,
leave a very diminiflied fpace for the water to occupy ;
fo that the life boat, when filled with water, contains
a confiderably lefs quantity than the common boat, and
is in no danger either of finking or overturning.
It may be prefumed by fome, that in cafes of high
wind, agitated fea, and broken weaves, a boat of fuch
a bulk could not prevail againft them by the force of
the oars; but the life-boat, from her peculiar form,
may be rowed a head, when the attempt in other boats
would fail (b). Boats of the common form, adapted
for fpeed, are of courfe put in motion with a fmall
pow7er; but for want of buoyancy and bearing, are
overrun by the waves and funk, wThen impelled againft
them : and boats conftrufted for burthen, meet with
too much refiftance from the wind and fca, when oppo-
fed to them, and cannot in fuch cafes be rowed from
the (hore to a (hip in diftrefs. An idea has been enter¬
tained that the fuperior advantages of the life-boat are
to be aferibed folely to the quantity of cork affixed;
but this is a very erroneous opinion, and I trufl has ,
been amply refuted by the preceding obfervations on .
the conftru&ion of this boat. It muft be admitted that
the application of cork to common boats would add to
their buoyancy and fecurity y and it might be a ufeful
expedient, if there was a quantity of cork; on board of .
(hips, to prepare the boats with, in cafes of (htpwreck,
as it might be expeditioufly done in a temporary way,
by means of clamps, or fome other contrivance. The
application of cork to fome of the boats of his majefty’s
(hips (the launches) might be worthy of confideration,
more particularly, as an experiment.might be made at
a little expence, and without injury to the boats,
“ The life-boat is kept in a boat-houfe, and placed
upon
(a) The (hort oar is more manageable, in a, high fea, than the long oar, and its ftroke is more certain.
(b) An extraordinary cafe might certainly happen, when a forcible combination of the wind, the waves, and
the tide, might render it impraflicable to row the life-boat from the (bore,
L I F
upon four low wheels, re^dy to be moved at a mo-
' ment’s notice. Thefe wheels are Convenient in con¬
veying tb6 boat along the fliore to the fea ; but if (lie
had to travel upon them, on a rough road, her frame
would be exceedingly fhaken 5 befides, it has been found
difficult and troublefome to replace her upon thefe
wheels, on her return from fea.
“ Another plan has therefore been adopted : two
wheels of 12 feet diameter, with a moveable arched
axis, and a pole fixed thereto, for a lever, have been
conftrudled. The boat is fufpended, near her centre,
between the wheels, under the axis $ tow ard each ex¬
tremity of which is an iron pin. When the pole is-ele¬
vated perpendicularly^ the upper part of the axis be¬
comes depreffed, and a pair of rope flings, which go
round the boat, being fixed to the iron pins, ffie is
raifed wdth Ihe greatefl facility, by means of the pole,
which is then faftened down to the ftem of the boat.”
Temporary LiFE-Boat,—an invention by the reverend
Mr Bremner minifler of Walls and Flota in Orkney,
by w’hich any ordinary ffiips boat may be converted in¬
to a life-beat, fo that in cafes of Ihipwreck, the crew
may be faved by means of their own boats. Mr Brem¬
ner dates, in deferibing his plan to the Highland So¬
ciety of Scotland, that it had received the approbation
of the Trinity houfes of London and Leith, of the
Royal Humane Society of London, and of many cap¬
tains of merchantmen. An experiment was made in
the poet of Leith under the fuperintendance of Mr
Bremner himfelf, and in prefence of a committee of the
directors of the fociety. This experiment proved fatis-
fa,£!ory to the committee, whofe favourable report to
the diredlors induced them to prefent Mr Bremner
with a piece of plate in teflimony of their approbation
of his fcheme. The following is a general defeription
of the method of preparing a boat for this purpofe.
“ The dimenfions of the (loop’s boat, with which
the experiment was tried, wTere 14 feet in length, 5
feet 4 inches in width, and 2 feet 2 inches in depth.
The only addition or previous preparation of the boat,
was four ring bolts in the infide, and two auger bores or
holes in the outfide of the keel, as points of fecurity
for fixing the neceffary feizing ropes (c). The ring
bolts, within fide the keel, were placed, the one for¬
ward, one-third from the ftem, the other aft, one-third
from the ftern $ the other two, the one diredlly at
the ftem, the other at the ftern. The auger bores,
outfide the keel, being half wTay betwdxt the rings, viz.
the one betwixt the two rings forward, the other be¬
twixt the twro rings aft.
“ Two empty hogffieads w'ere then placed in the
fore part of the boat, parallel and clofe to each other,
and laid lengthw-ays, fore and aft. Thefe w^ere fecured
in their places by palling the feizing ropes round all,
that is. over the gunwales and through the auger bore
in the keel, as alfo from the ring bolt in the flem to
that next it in the keel, taking care in doing this, to
pafs the rope alfo through eyes on the flings of the
calks, which had been previoufly prepared. The fame
procefs w as obferved in the after part of the boat. And
L I F
laftly, a bar of iron about three hundred Weight, was
fixed to the keel, on the infide. A fmall quantity of
cork was allb placed in the ftern, intended chiefly to
raile to a proper height the calks placed above it, but
without which the refult of the experiment would have
been the fame.
“ The quantity of cork neceflary, which will depend
on the fize of the boat, is to be made up into feveral
parcels, but none larger than one perfon can eafily
manage. Each parcel to be properly lecured and num¬
bered, fo as that the whole may fit and .fill up the boat
completely, in the fpaces betwixt the ring bolts, fore
and aft, as above deferibed j and to anfwer the end, it
is material that there ffiould be cork enough to rife
nearly three feet above the gunwales, fo as to form an
arch from gunwale to gunwale. The cork being
thus laid in the boat, it is to be properly fecured, firlt
by palling a ftrong rope round all, over the gunwales,
and through the auger bore, outfide the keel; as alfo
by palling feizing ropes from the ring bolt in the ftem,
to that next it in the keel, taking care to make as
many turns and feizings betwixt thefe ring bolts, as
completely to fecute the cork from flipping out. The
very fame thing to be done as to the rope round the
gunwales, and through the hole outfide the keel, with
feizing ropes from the ring bolts, to be made aft, or in
the ftern of the boat.
“ Where cork cannot be had, or may not be kept
in readinefs on account of its expencc, which, however,
is not very great, calks will anfwer the purpofe, though
it may be doubtful whether there would not be a great¬
er chance that the fury of the waves might unloofe
them, unlefs particular care was taken to have them
properly fixed. In the cafe of calks, two empty ones
are to be placed in the fore part of the boat, parallel
to one another, clofe together, and to be laid length-
wife fore and aft. Two other empty calks to be placed
in the fame w'ay in the ftern, or aft part of the boat,
and the wffiole to be fecured as firmly and compa&ly as
poffible, by ftrong ropes round the boat and calks, and
alfo by feizing ropes in the fame w*ay as deferibed in
the cafe of cork j then two other empty calks, of the
fame dimenfions, one fore, and another aft, to be
placed over and in the middle between the two al¬
ready fixed, and to be firmly fecured, as above-men¬
tioned.
“ As the boat is to be thus prepared on the deck of
the Ihip, wffien danger appears, a piece of fail ffiould
be thrown in below, betwixt, and about the calks, for
the more effe&ually fecuring them, and to prevent the
feizing ropes from fo readily flipping •, it would be
proper alfo to have flings on the calks, with eyes in'
them, through which to pafs the feizing ropes.
“ Laftly, both in the cafe of cork and calks, an iron
bar, of about three hundred weight, for fuch a boat as
above defcribed, Ihould be fecured to the keel on the
infide, in the middle or empty fpace. This middle, or
empty fpace of the boat, is ipr the failors, and in a
(hip’s boat of the common fize may hold eight people,
with room to work a pair of oars. Every thing being
previoufly
[ 8 ]
(t) It is probable, that ring bolts fixed in the gunw ales, might anfwer as well as palling the ropes round the
bottom of the boat and through the auger bores in the keel.
L I G [
Life previoufly ready, it is certain that the neceffary fixing
II of the calks will not take up above ten or twelve mi-
Ligature. ^ nuteSj antl it is obvious the cork can be fixed in a much
Ihorter period. It is alfo completely afcertained, that
a boat fo prepared, though full of water, will not fink,
but on the contrary be extremely buoyant, and will
eafily go a-head : That it would be next to impoffible
the boat fliould overfet •, but, in cafe of this at any time
happening, fire would inftantly return to her proper
pofition on her keel. Though the experiment was
tried only with calks, with but a fmall quantity of
cork, as before ftated, yet it is generally believed, and
and Mr Bremner himfelf is of the fame opinion, that it
might anfwer equally well, and perhaps better, to have
the cork or calks flowed in midfliips, leaving an empty
fpace in each end, by which means the management of
the boat by the helm or rudder would be preferved,
though the other plan feems better, in the view of ufing
oars.

LIGATURE, in Surgery, is a cord,'band, or
firing j or the binding any part of the body with a
cord, band, fillet, &c. whether of leather, linen, or any

Ligatures are ufed to extend or replace bones that
are broken or diflocated j to tie the patients down in
lithotomy and amputations j to tie upon the veins in
phlebotomy, on the arteries in amputations, or in large
wounds; to fecure the fplints that are applied to frac¬
tures ; to tie up the proceffes of the peritonaeum wdth
the fpermatic veflels in caftration; and, laftly, in taking
off w'arts or other excrefcences by ligature.
Ligature, is alfo ufed to fignify a kind of bandage
or fillet, tied round the neck, arm, leg, or other part
of the bodies of men or beafts, to divert or drive off
fome difeafe, accident, &c.
Ligature, is alfo ufed for a ftate of impotency, in
refpedl to venery, pretended to be caufed by fome

perfons, and done with defign to elude and counter¬
work any other perfon that might pofiibly be inducing
the ligature.
The fecret of inducing a ligature is delivered by the
fame author, as he was taught it on the fpot by one
of their adepts : but it is too abfurd and obfcene to
delerve being tranfcribed here.
M. Marlhal mentions a ridiculous form of ligature,
which he received from a bramin of Indoftan : “ If
(fays he) the little worm in the wood lukerara kara
be cut into two, and the one part ftirs and the other
not, if the flirting part be bruifed, and given with half
a beetle to a man, and the other half to a w’oman, the
charm will keep each from ever having to do with any
other perfon. Phil. Tranf. N° 268.
Ligature, in the Italian mufic, fignifies a tying
or binding together of notes. Hence fyncopes
are often called ligatures, becaufe they are made by
the . ligature of many notes. There is another fort
of ligatures for breves, when there are many of thefe
on different lines, or on different fpaces, to be fung to
one fyllable.
Ligatures, among printers, are types confifting of
two letters or characters joined together j as B, is’, ff,
Jl, Ji. The old editions of Greek authors are extreme¬
ly full of ligatures •, the ligatures of Stephens are by
much the moft beautiful.—Some editions have been
lately printed without any ligatures at all j and there
was a defign to explode them quite out of printing.,
Had this fucceeded, the fineft ancient editions would
in time have grown ufelefs : and the reading of old
manufcripts would have been rendered almofl impracti¬
cable to the learned themfelves.
LIGHT, in the moft common acceptation of the
wTord, fignifies that invifible etherial matter which makes
objeCts perceptible to our fenfe of feeing. Figurative¬
ly, it is alfo ufed for whatever conveys inftruCtion to
our minds, and likewife for that inffruCtion itfelf.

Light independent of Heat. In general, a very con-
fiderable degree of heat is requifite to the emiflion of
light from any body; but there are feveral excep¬
tions to this, efpecially in light proceeding from pu-
trefcent fubftances and phofphorus, together with that
of luminous animals, and other fimilar appearances.
Light proceeding from putrefcent animal and vege¬
table fubftances, as well as from glow-worms, is men¬
tioned by Ariftotle. Thomas Bartholin mentions four ^uce
kinds of luminous infeCls, two with wings, and two an,mfL
without j but in hot climates travellers fay they are p'lS3’2o6'
found in much greater numbers, and of different fpe-*
B cies.

cits. Columna, an induftrious naturaliit, obferves, that
v thdr light is not extinguilhed immediately upon the
death of the animal.
Light frcna The firft diftinft account that we meet with of light
Putt'd IhdP-procecc|jng from putrefcent animal ilefh is that which
fie Vijione, is given by Fabricius ab Aquapendente ; who fays,
that when three Roman youths, refiding at Padua,
had bought a lamb, and had eaten part of it on Ra¬
fter day 1562, feveral pieces of the remainder, which
they kept till the day following, fhone like fo many
dandies when they were cafually viewed in the dark.
Part of this luminous flefh was immediately fent to
Aquapendente, who was profeflbr of anatomy in that
city. He obferved, that both the lean and the fat of
this meat (hone with a whitifh kind of light ; and alfo
took notice, that fome pieces of kid’s flefh, which had
happened to have lain in contaft with it, w’ere luminous,
as well as the fingers and other parts of the bodies of
thofe perfons who touched it. Thofe parts, he ob¬
ferved, fhone the moft which were foft to the touch,
and feemed to be tranfparent in candle light; but
where the flefb was thick and folid, or where a bone
was near the outfide, it did not fhine.
After this appearance, we find no account of any
other firailar to it, before that which was obferved by
Bartholin, and of which he gives a very pompous de-
feription in his ingenious treatife already quoted.
This happened at Montpelier in 1641, when a poor
old woman had bought a piece of flefh in the market,
intending to make ufe of it the day following. But
happening not to be able to fleep well that night, and
her bed and pantry being in the fame room, fhe obferv¬
ed fo much light come from the flefh, as t© illuminate
all the place where it hung. A part of this luminous
flefh was carried as a curiofity to Henry Bourbon,
duke of Conde, the governor of the place, who viewed
it for feveral hours with the greateft aftonifhment.
This light was obferved to be whitifh ; and not to
cover the whole furface of the flefh, but certain parts
only, as if gems of unequal fplendour had been fcattered
over it. This flefh was kept till it began to putrefy,
■when the light vanifhed •, which, as fome religious
people fancied, it did in the form of a crofs.
It is natural to expe6t, that the almoft univerfal ex¬
perimental philof'opher Mr Boyle fhould try the effeft
of his air-pump upon thefe luminous fubftances. Ac¬
cordingly, we find that he did not fail to do it j when
he prefently found that the light of rotten wood was
extinguilhed in vacuo, and revived again on the ad-
miffion of the air, even after a long continuance in
vacuo ; but the extinguifhing of this light was not fo
complete immediately upon exhaufting the receiver, as
fome little time afterwards. He could not perceive, .
however, that the light of rotten wood was increafed
in condenfed air 5 but this, he imagined, might arife
from his not being able to judge very well of the de¬
gree of light, through fo thick and cloudy a glafs
Bird's hijl. veflel as he then made ufe of j but we find that the
light of a fhining fifh, which was put into a condenf-
ing engine before the Royal Society, in 1668, was
rendered more vivid by that means. The principal
of Mr Boyle’s experiments were made in October
1667.
This philofopher attended to a great variety of cir-
cumftances relating to this curious phenomenon. A-

mong other things he obferved, that change of air w’as Light
not neceffary to the maintenance of this light j for ft1——y—
continued a long time when a piece of the wood was
put into a very fmall glafs hermetically fealed, and it
made no difference when this tube which contained
the wood was put into an exhaufled receiver. This
he alfo obferved with refpeff to a luminous fifh, which
he put into water, and placed in the fame circum-
ftances. He alfo found, that the light of fhining
fifhes had other properties in common with that of
fhining wood ; but the latter, he fays, was prefently
quenched with water, fpirit of wine, a greater variety
of faline mixtures, and other fluids. Water, however,
did not quench all the light of fome finning veal on
which he tried it, though fpirit of wine deftroyed its
virtue prefently.
Mr Boyle’s obfeivation of light proceeding from
flefh meat was quite cafual. On the 15th of Februa-
ary 1662, one of his fervants was greatly alarmed
with the fhining of fome veal, which had been kept
a few days, but had no bad fmell, and was in a flate
very proper for ufe. The fervant immediately made
his mailer acquainted with this extraordinary appear¬
ance $ and though he was then in bed, he ordered it si,ch iL -
to be immediately brought to him, and he examined 70.
it with the greateft attention. Sufpeiffing that the
ftate of the atmofphere had fome fhare in the produc¬
tion of this phenomenon, he takes notice, after de-
feribing the appearance, that the wind was fouth-wTeft
and bluftering, the air hot for the feafon, the moon
was paft its laft quarter, and the mercury in the baro¬
meter wras at 29 T’oth inches.
Mr Boyle wras often difappointed in his experiments Light from
on fhining fifhes 5 finding that they did not always fifties,
fhine in the very fame circumftances, as far as he could
judge, with others which had fhined before. At one
time that they failed to fhine, according to his expec¬
tations, he obferved that the weather wras variable,
and not without fome days of froft and fnow. In
general he made ufe of whitings, finding them the
fitteft for his purpofe. In a difeourfe, however, up¬
on this fubjedl at the Royal Society in 1681, it was
afferted, that, of all fifhy fubftances, the eggs of lob-
fters, after they had been boiled, fhone the brighteft.
Olig. Jacoboeus obferves, that, upon opening a fea- ^ jfaea
polypus, it was fo luminous as to ftartle feveral per- vol. v.
fons who faw it j and he fays, that the more putrid thep- 282*
fifh was, the more luminous it grew. The nails alfo,
and the fingers of the perfons who touched it, became
luminous j and the black liquor wBich iffued from the
animal, and which is its bile, fhone alfo, but with a
very faint light.
Mr Boyle draws a minute comparifon between the
light of burning coals and that of fhining wood or fifh,
{bowing in what particulars they agree, and in what
they differ. Among other things he obferves, that ex¬
treme cold extinguifhes the light of fhining wood, as
appeared when a piece of it was put into a glafs tube,
and held in a frigorific mixture. He alfo found that
rotten tvood did not wafte itfelf by fhining, and that
the application of a thermometer to it did not difeo-
ver the leaf! degree of heat.
There is a remarkable (hell-fifh called pholas, which Of pre¬
forms for itfelf holes in various kinds of ftone, &c. ^as> a r^-

L I G [ i
iight. obferves, that it (hines in the mouth of the perfon who
eats it, and, if it touch his hands or clothes, makes
them luminous. He alfo fays that the light depends
upon its moiftnre. The light of this filh has furnilhed
matter for various obfervations and experiments to
M. Reaumur, and the Bolognian academicians, efpe-
cially Beccarius, who took fo much pains with the
fubjeft of phofphoreal light.
M. Reaumur obferves, that, whereas other fifties
give light when they tend to putrelcence, this is more
luminous in proportion to its being frefti j that when
they are dried, their light will revive if they be moiften-
ed either with freth or fait water, but that brandy im¬
mediately extinguilhes it. He endeavoured to make
this light permanent, but none of his fchemes fuc-
ceeded.
The attention of the Bolognian academicians was
engaged to this fubjecl by M. F. Marfilius, in I724>
who brought a number of thefe fifties, and the ftones
in which they were enclofed, to Bologna, on purpofe
for their examination.
■€om.Bonon. Beccarius obferved, that though this fifli ceafed to
vol.ii. *32. flfine when it became putrid*, yet that in its moft pu¬
trid ftate, it would ftiine, and make the water in which
it was immerfed luminous, when it was agitated.
Galeatius and Montius found, that wine or vinegar ex-
tinguiftied this light $ that in common oil it continued
fome days ; but in redtified fpirit of wine or urine,
hardly a minute.
In order to obferve in what manner this light was af-
fedled by different degrees of heat, they made ufe of a
Reaumur’s thermometer, and found that water render¬
ed luminous by thefe fifties increafed in light till the
heat arrived to 45 degrees $ but that it then became
fuddenly extindl, and could not be revived.
In the experiments of Beccarius, a folution of fea
fait Increafed the light of the luminous water j a folu¬
tion of nitre did not increafe it quite fo much. Sal
ammoniac diminiftied it a little, oil of tartar per deli-
quium nearly extinguiftied it, and the acids entirely.
This water poured upon frefti calcined gypfum, rock
cryftal, cerufe, or fugar, became more luminous. He
alfo tried the effedfs of it when poured upon various
other fubftances, but there was nothing very remark¬
able in them. Afterwards, ufing luminous milk, he
found that oil of vitriol extinguiftied the light, but
that oil of tartar increafed it.
This gentleman had the curiofity to try how dif¬
ferently coloured fubftances were affedted by this kind
of light j and having, for this purpofe, dipped feveral
ribbons in it, the white came out the brighteft, next
to this was the yellow, and then the green j the other
colours could hardly be perceived. It was not, how¬
ever, any particular colour, but only light that was
perceived in this cafe. He then dipped boards painted
with the different colours, and alfo glafs tubes, filled
with fubftances of different colours, in water rendered
luminous by the fifties. In both thefe cafes the red
was hardly vifible, the yellow was the brighteft, and
the violet the dulleft. But on the boards the blue was
nearly equal to the yellow, and the green more lan¬
guid j whereas in the glaffes, the blue was inferior to
the green.
Of all the liquors into which he put the pholades,
milk was rendered the moft luminous. A fingle pho-
i ] L I G
las made fevefi ounces of milk fo luminous, that the Light,
faces of perfons might be diftinguiftied by it, and it v
looked as if it wras tranfparent.
Air appeared to be neceifary to this light $ for
when Beccarius put the luminous milk into glafs tubes,
no agitation would make it ftiine, unlefs bubbles of
air were mixed with it. Alfo Montius and Galeatius
found, that, in an exhaufted receiver, the pholas loft
its light, but the wTater was fometimes made more lu¬
minous j which they aferibed to the rifing of bubbles
of air through it.
Beccarius, as well as Reaumur, had many fchemes
to render the light of thefe pholades permanent. For
this purpofe he kneaded the juice into a kind of pafte,
with ftour, and found that it would give light when
it was immerfed in wrarm water ; but it anfwered beft
to preferve the fifti in honey. In any other method of
prefervation, the property of becoming luminous would
not continue longer than fix months, but in honey it
had lafted above a year j and then it would, when
plunged in warm water, give as much light as ever it
had done.
Similar, in fome refpefts, to thofe obfervations on Acla Cafa-
the light of the pholas, was that wbich was obferved
to proceed from wood which was moift, but not in a ^
putrid ftate, which w-as very confpicuous in the dark.
That the fea is fometimes luminous, efpecially when Light from
it is put in motion by the daftiing of oars or the ^ea water*
beating of it againft a ftiip, has been obferved with
admiration by a great number of perfons. Mr Boyle,
after reciting all the circumftances of this appearance,
as far as he could colledt them from the accounts of
navigators j as its being extended as far as the eye
could reach, and at other times being vifible only when
the water was dallied againft fome other body j that,
in fome feas, this phenomenon is accompanied by fome
particular winds, but not in others $ and that fome¬
times one part of the fea will be luminous, when an¬
other part, not far from it, will not *be fo 5 concludes
with faying, that he could not help fufpefring that
thefe odd phenomena, belonging to great maffes of wa¬
ter, were in fome meafure owing to fome cofmical law
or cuftom of the terreftrial globe, or at leaft of the
planetary vortex.
Some curious obfervations on the Ihining of fome Beale s
fifties, and the pickle in wriiich they were immerfed, exPen*
were made by Dr Beale, in May 1665 •, and had they °n
been properly attended to and purfued, might have
led to the difeovery of the caufe of this appearance.
Having put fome boiled mackerel into water, together Phil.Tranf.
with fait and fweet herbs ; when the cook was, fome vol‘ ^x"
time after, ftirring it, in order to take out fome of the tJ
fifties, (he obferved, that, at the firft motion, the water
was very luminous ; and that the fifti Ihining through
the water added much to the light which the water
yielded. The water was of itfelf thick and blackifti,
rather than of any other colour j and yet it ftiined on
being ftirred, and at the fame time the fifties appeared
more luminous than the water. Wherever the drops
of this water, after it had been ftirred, fell to the
ground, they ftiined j and the children in the family
diverted themfelves with taking the drops, which were
as broad as a penny, and running with them about the
houfe. The cook obferved, that, when ftie turned up
that fide of the fifti that was loweft, no light came from
B 2 it;
L I G [i
t Iit j and that, when the water had fettled for fome time,
' ‘ it did not ihine at all. The day following, the water
gave but little light, and only after a brilk agitation,
though the fillies continued to Ihine as well from the
infide as the outfide, and efpecially about the throat,
and fuch places as feemed to have been a little broken
in the boiling.
When in the light of the fun, he examined, with a
microfcope, a fmall piece of a fiih which had fhined very
much the night before, he found nothing remarkable
on its furface, except that he thought he perceived
what he calls a Jieam, rather dark than luminous,
arifing like a very fmall dull from the filh, and here
and there a very fmall and almoft imperceptible fparkle.
Of the fparkles he had no doubt; but he thought it
poflible that the fleam might be a deception of the
fight, or fome dull in the air.
Finding the filh to be quite dry, he moiftened it
with his fpittle ; and then obferved that it gave a little
light, though but for a Ihort time. The filh at that
time wTas not fetid, nor yet infipid to the bell difcern-
ing palate. Two of the fillies he kept two or three
- days longer for farther trial : but, the weather being
very hot, they became fetid : and, contrary to his ex-
pedlations, there w7as no more light produced either by
the agitation of the water or in the filh.
Father Father Bourzes, in his voyage to the Indies in
Bourzes’s 1704, took particular notice of the luminous appear-
fuminous0 ance t^e ^ea* ^ was fometimes fo great,
fea water, he could eafily read the title of a book by it,
though he was nine or ten feet from the furface of the
water. Sometimes he could eafily dillinguilh, in the
wake of a Ihip, the particles that were luminous from
thofe that were not j and they appeared not to be all
of the fame figure. Some of them were like points of
light, and others fuch as liars appear to the naked eye.
Some of them were like globes, of a line or two in
diameter; and others as big as one’s head. Sometimes
they formed themfelves into fquares of three or four
inches long, and one or two broad. Sometimes all
thefe different figures were vifible at the fame time ;
and fometimes they were what he calls vortices of light,
which at one particular time appeared and difappeared
immediately like flalhes of lightning.
Nor did only the wake of the Ihip produce this
light, but fifhes alfo, in fwimming, left fo luminous a
track behind them, that both their fize and fpecies
might be diftinguilhed by it. When he took fome of
the water out of the fea, and llirred it ever fo little
with his hand, in the dark, he always faw in it an in¬
finite number of bright particles; and he had the fame
appearance whenever he dipped a piece of linen in the
fea, and wrung it in a dark place, even though it w^as
half dry ; and he obferved, that when the fparkles fell
upon any thing that was folid, it would continue (hining
for fome hours together.
His conjee- After mentioning feveral circumllances which did
lures con- not contribute to this appearance, this father obferves,
eaufe?g ^ t^at 'lt depends very much upon the quality of the water;
and he was pretty fure that this light is the greateft
when the water is fatteft, and fulleft of foam. For in
the main fea, he fays, the water is not everywhere
equally pure 5 and that fometimes, if linen be dipped
in the fea, it is clamny when it is drawn up again :
and he often obferyed, that when the wake of the fhip
2 ] l 1 G
was the brighteff, the water was the moft fat and Light,
glutinous, and that linen moifiened w ith it produced
a great deal of light, if it was ftirred or moved brilkly.
Befides, in fome parts of the fea, he faw a fubitance
like faw duft, fometimes red and fometimes yellow ;
and when he drew up the water in thofe places, it
was always vifeous and glutinous. The failors told
him, that it was the fpawn of whales ; that there are
great quantities of it in the north ; and that fome¬
times, in the night, they appeared all over of a bright
light, without being put in motion by any veffel or fiih
paffing by them.
As a confirmation of this conjedlure, that the more
glutinous the fea water is, the more it is difpofed to
become luminous, he obferves, that one day they took a
fifli which was called a bonite, the infide of the mouth of
which w^as fo luminous, that, without any other light,
he could read the fame charafters wrhich he had before
read by the light in the wake of the fliipj and the
mouth of this fiih was full of a vifeous matter, which,
wdien it was rubbed upon a piece of wTood, made it im¬
mediately all over luminous j though, when the moif-
ture w7as dried up, the light was extinguiflied/'
The abbe Nollet was much ftruck with the lumi-Abbe Nol-
noufnefs of the fea when he wras at Venice in 1749; let’s theory*
and, after taking a great deal of pains to afeertain the
circumftances of it, concluded that it wras occaiioned
by a ihining infedi; and having examined the wTater
very often, he at length did find a fmall infedi:, which
he particularly deferibes, and to which he attributes
the light. The fame hypothefis had alfo occurred to
M. Vianelli, profeffor of medicine in Chioggia near
Venice y. and both he and M. Grizellini, a phyfician in
Venice, have given drawings of the infedts from which
they imagined this light to proceed.
The abbe was the more confirmed in his hypothefis,
by obferving, fome time after, the motion of fome lumi¬
nous particles in the fea. For, going into the water,
and keeping his head juft above the furface, he faw
them dart from the bottom, which was covered with
weeds, to the top, in a manner which he thought
very much refembled the motions of infedts ; though,
when he endeavoured to catch them, he only found
fome luminous fpots upon his handkerchief, which
were enlarged when he preffed them with his finger.
M. le Roi, making a voyage on the Mediterranean, obferva-
prefently after the abbe Nollet made his obfervationstions of M.
at Venice, took notice, that in the day time, the prow*6
of the ihip in motion threw up many fmall particles,
which, falling upon the water, rolled upon the furface Memoires
of the fea for a few feconds before they mixed with Prefer^tes,
it j and in the night the fame particles, as he con-voh ih-144=
eluded, had the appearance of fire. Taking a quan¬
tity of the water, the fame fmall fparks appeared
whenever it was agitated j but, as was obfervsd with
refpedl to Dr Beale’s experiments, every fucceflive agi¬
tation produced a lefs effedt than the preceding, except
after being fuffered to reft a while j for then a freih
agitation would make it almoft as luminous as the firft.
This water, he obferved, would retain its property of
ihining by agitation a day or two j but it difappeared
immediately on being fet on the fire, though it was
not made to boil.
This gentleman, after giving much attention to this
phenomenon, concludes, that it is not occafioned by

any ilnnmg infers, as the abbe Nollet imagined j efpe-
J cially as, after carefully examining fome of the lumi¬
nous points, which he caught upon an handkerchief,
he found them to be round like large pins heads, but
with nothing of the appearance of any animal, though
he viewed them with a microfcope. He alfo found,
that the mixture of a little fpirit of wine with water
juft drawn from the fea, would give the appearance of
a great number of little fparks, which would continue
vifible longer than thofe in the ocean. All the acids,
and various other liquors, produced the fame efiefl,
though not quite fo confpicuoufly ; but no frelh agi¬
tation would make them luminous again. M. le Roi
is far from afferting that there are no luminous infe&s
in the fea. He even fuppofes that the abbe Nollet
and M. Vianelli had found them. But he was fatif-
fied that the fea is luminous chiefly on fome other ac¬
count, though he does not fo much as advance a con-
je&ure about what it is.
M. Ant. Martin made many experiments on the
light of fifties, with a view to difcover the caufe of the
light of the fea. He thought that he had reafon to
conclude, from a great variety of experiments, that all
fea fifties have this property *, but that it is not to be
found in any that are produced in frefti water. No¬
thing depended upon the colour of the fifties, except
that he thought that the white ones, and efpecially
thofe that had white fcales, were a little more lumi¬
nous than others. This light, he found, was increafed
by a fmall quantity of fait 5 and alfo by a fmall degree
of warmth, though a greater degree extinguifhed it.
This agrees with another obfervation of his, that it
depends entirely upon a kind of moifture which they
had about them, and which a fmall degree of heat
would expel, when an oilinefs remained which did not
give this light, but would burn in the fire. Light from
the flefti of birds or beafts is not fo bright, he fays, as
that which proceeds from fi(h. Human bodies, he fays,
have fometimes emitted light about the time that they
began to putrefy, and the walls and roof of a place
in which dead bodies had often been expofed, had a
kind of dew or cla itninefs upon it, which was fome¬
times luminous *, and he imagined that the lights which
are faid to be feen in burying-grounds may be owing
to this caufe.
From fome experiments made by Mr Canton, he
concludes, that the luminoufnefs of fea water is owfing
to the flimy and other putrefcent fubftances it con¬
tains. On the evening of the 14th of June Ij68, he
put a fmall frefti whiting into a gallon of fea water, in
a pan which was about 14 inches in diameter, and
took notice that neither the whiting nor the wmter,
when agitated, gave any light. A Fahrenheit’s ther¬
mometer, in the cellar where the pan was placed, flood
at 540. The 15th, at night, that part of the fifti
which was even with the furface of the water was lu¬
minous, but the water itfelf was dark. He drew the
end of a flick through it, from one fide of the pan to
the other ; and the water appeared luminous behind
the flick all the way, but gave light only where it
was difturbed. When all the water was ftirred, the
whole became luminous, and appeared like milk, giv¬
ing a confiderable degree of light to the fides of the
pan *, and it continued to do fo for fome time after it
was at reft. The water was moft luminous when the
fifti had been in it about 28 hours 5 but would not give Light,
any light by being ftirred, after it had been in it three ‘■'-’""v*—
days.
Fie then put a gallon of frefli water into one pan,
and an equal quantity of fea water into another •, and
into each pan he put a frefli herring of about three
ounces. The next night the whole furface of the fea
water was luminous without being ftirred j but it was
much more fo wrhen it was put in motion ; and the
upper part of the herring, which was confiderably be¬
low the furface of the water, was alfo very bright;
while at the fame time the frelh water, and the fifti
that was in it, were quite dark. There were feveral
very bright luminous fpots on different parts of the
furface of the fea water 5 and the whole, when viewed
by the light of a candle, feemed covered with a greafy
fcum. The third night, the light of the fea water
while at reft, was very little, if at all lefs than before j
but when ftirred, its light wras fo great as to difcover
the time by a w7atch, and the fifti in it appeared as a
dark fubftance. After this, its light w^as evidently
decreafing, but was not quite gene before the yth night.
The frefti w-ater and the fifti in it were perfe&ly dark
during the whole time. The thermometer was gene¬
rally above 6o°.
The preceding experiments were made with fea
rvater : but he now made ufe of other water, into wftiich
he put common or fea fait, till he found, by an hydro¬
meter, that it was of the fame fpecific gravity with the
fea water 5 and, at the fame time, in another gallon of
water, he diffolved two pounds of fait 5 and into each
of thefe waters he put a fmall frefti herring. The next
evening the whole furface of the artificial fea water
was luminous without being ftirred j but gave much
more light when it was difturbed. It appeared exadlly
like the real fea water in the preceding experiment;
its light lafted about the fame time, and went off in
the fame manner : while the other water, which was
almoft as fait as it could be made, never gave any
light. The herring which was taken out of it the
feventh night, and w7aftied from its fait, was found firm
and fweet ", but the other herring was very foft and
putrid, much more fo than that which had been kept
as long in frefti water. If a herring, in warm weather,
be put into 10 gallons of artificial fea water, inftead
of one, the water, he fays, w'ill ftill become luminous,
but its light wall not be fo ftrong.
It appeared by fome of the firft obfervations on
this fubjedt, that heat extinguilhes the light of putref¬
cent fubftances. Mr Canton alfo attended to this cir-
cumftance •, and obferves, that though the greateft
fummer heat is well known to promote putrefaftion,
yet 20 degrees more than that of the human blood
feems to hinder it. For putting a fmall piece of a
luminous fifti into a thin glafs ball, he found, that
water of the heat of n 8 degrees would extinguifti its
light in lefs than half a minute ; but that, on taking
it out of the water, it would begin to recover its light
in about 10 feconds; but it was . never afterw’ards-fa
bright as before.
Mr Canton made the fame obfervation that Mr Ant.
Martin had done, viz. that feveral kinds of river fifti
could not be made to give light, in the fame circum-
ftances in which any fea fifti became luminous. He
fays, however, that a piece of carp made the water very
luminous,

luminous, though the outfide, or fcaly part of it, did
^ not fhine at all.
For the fake of thofe perfons who may choofe to re¬
peat his experiments, he obferves, that artificial fea wa¬
ter may be made without the ufe of an hydrometer, by
the proportion of four ounces avoirdupois of fait to feven
'piints of water, wine meafure.
A very elaborate paper on the fubjedt by Dr Hulme
appeared in the Philofophical Tranfa&ions for 1800, to
which we refer our readers, and to Chemistry, p. 451.
From undoubted obfervations, however, it appears,
that in many places of the ocean it is covered with lumi¬
nous infects to a very confiderable extent. M. Dagelet,
a French aftronomer ivho returned from the Terra Au-
ftralis in the year I774> brought with him feveral kinds
of worms which ftiine in water when it is fet in motion •,
and M. Rigaud, in a paper inferted (if we are not mif-
taken) in the Journal des S^avans for the month of
March 1770, affirms, that the luminous furface of the
fea, from the port of Breft to the Antilles, contains an
immenfe quantity of little, round, ffiining polypufes of
about a quarter of a line in diameter. Other learned
men, who acknowledge the exillence of thefe luminous
animals, cannot, however, be perfuaded to conlider
them as the caufe of all that light and fcintillation that
appear on the furface of the ocean : they think that
fome fubftance of the phofphorus kind, ariiing from pu-
trefadlion, mull be admitted as one of the caufes of this
phenomenon. M. Godehoue has publiffied curious ob¬
fervations on a kind of fiffi called in French bonite, al¬
ready mentioned ; and though he has obferved, and ac¬
curately defcribed, feveral of the luminous infers that
are found in fea water, he is, neverthelefs, of opinion,
that the fcintillation and flaming light of the fea pro¬
ceed from the oily and greafy fubftances with which it
is impregnated.
The abbe Nollet was long of opinion, that the light
of the fea proceeded from eledtricity (aJ) j though he
afterwards feemed inclined to think, that this pheno¬
menon was caufed by fmall animals, either by their lu¬
minous afpedt, or at leaft by fome liquor or effluvia
which they emitted. He did not, however, exclude
other caufes j among thefe, the fpawn or fry of fifli de-
ferves to be noticed. M. Dagelet, failing into the bay
of Antongil, in the ifland of Madagafcar, obferved a
prodigious quantity of fry which covered the furface
of the fea above a mile in length, and wffiich he at firft
took for banks of fand on account of their colour ; they
•xhaled a difagreeable odour, and the fea had appear¬
ed with uncommon fplendor fome days before. The
fame accurate obferver, perceiving the fea remarkably
luminous in the road of the Cape of Good Hope during
a perfedl calm, remarked, that the oars of the canoes
produced a wfflitilh and pearly kind of luftre j when he
took in his hand the water which contained this phof¬
phorus, he difcerned in it, for fome minutes, globules
of light as large as the heads of pins. When he prefled
thefe globules, they appeared to his touch like a foft
and thin pulp 5 and fome days after the fea was covered

To putrefaftion, alfo, fome are willing to attribute
that luminous appearance which goes by the name of
ignUfatuus, to which the credulous vulgar afcribe very hnisf<*~
extraordinary and efpeciaily mifchievous powers, ittum'
is moil frequently obferved in boggy places and near
rivers, though fometimes alfo in dry places. By its
appearance benighted travellers are faid to have been
fometimes milled into marfliy places, taking the light
which they faw before them for a candle at a diftance \
from which feemingly mifchievous property it has been
thought by the vulgar to be a fpirit of a malignant na¬
ture, and been named accordingly Will with a wifjt>, or
Jack with a Ian thorn ; for the lame reafon alfo it pro¬
bably had its Latin name ignis fatuus.
This kind of light is faid to be frequent about bury¬
ing places and dunghills. Some countries are alfo
remarkable for it, as about Bologna in Italy, and fome
parts of Spain and Ethiopia. Its forms are fo un¬
certain and variable that they can fcarce be defcribed,
efpecially as few philofophical obfervers ever had the
good fortune to meet wdth it. Dr Derham, however,
happened one night to perceive one of them, and got
fo near that he could have a very advantageous view
of it. This is by no means eafy to be obtained 5 for,
among other Angularities of the ignis fatuus, it is
obferved to avoid the approach of any perfon, and
fly from place to place as if it was animated. That
wffiich Dr Derham obferved w7as in fome boggy ground
betwdxt twro rocky hills j and the night was dark and
calm ; by which means, probably, he was enabled to
advance within two or three yards of it. It appeared
like a complete body of light without any divifion, fo
that he was fure it could not be occalioned by infefls
as fome have fuppofed j the feparate lights of wffiich
he could not have failed to diftinguilh, had it been
occafloned by them. The light kept dancing about
a dead thiftle, till a very flight motion of the air, oc¬
calioned, as he fuppofed, by his near approach to it,
made it jump to another place; after which it kept
flying before him as he advanced. M. Beccaria endea¬
voured to procure all the intelligence he could concern*
ing this phenomenon, by inquiring of all his acquaint¬
ance who might have had an opportunity of obferving
it. Thus he obtained information that two of thefe
lights appeared in the plains about Bologna, the one to
the north, and the other to the fouth, of that city, and
were to be feen almolt every dark night, efpecially that
to the eaftward, giving a light equal to an ordinary
faggot. The latter appeared to a gentleman of his ac¬
quaintance as he w7as travelling ; moved conftantly be¬
fore him for about a mile $ and gave a better light
than a torch which was carried before him. Both thefe
appearances gave a very ftrong light, and were con-
ftantly in motion, though this various and uncertain.
Sometimes they would rife, fometimes link ; but com¬
monly they would hover about fix feet from the
ground ; they would alfo frequently difappear on a hid¬
den,

Auftrian fervice, under the title, Dell'1 Eletrecifmo.

Light, den, and appear again in fome other place. They dif-
^ fertd alfo in fize and figure, fometimes fpreading pret¬
ty wide, and then centrafting themfelves j fometimes
breaking into two, and then joining again. Sometimes
they would appear like waves, at others they would
feem to drop fparks of fire: they were but little aifiedl:-
ed by the wind } and in wet and rainy weather were
frequently obferved to caft a ftronger light than in dry
weather : they were alfo obferved more frequently
when fnow lay upon the ground, than in the hotteft
fummer 5 but he was affured that there was not a dark
night throughout the whole year in which they were
not to be feen. The ground to the eaftward of Bolog¬
na, where the largeft of thefe appearances was o$ferved,
is a hard chalky foil mixed with clay, which will re¬
tain the moifture for a long time, but breaks and cracks
in hot weather. On the mountains, where the foil is of
a loofer texture, and lefs capable of ^retaining moilture,
the ignes fatui were lefs.
From the beft information which M. Beccaria was
able to procure, he found that thefe lights urere very
frequent about rivers and brooks. He concludes
his narrative with the following Angular account:
“ An intelligent gentleman travelling in the evening,
between eight and nine, in a mountainous road about
ten miles fouth of Bologna, perceived a light which
fhone very ftrangely upon fome flones wdrich lay on the
banks of the river Rioverde. It feemed to be about
two feet above the Hones, and not far from the water.
In fize and figure it had the appearance of a parallele¬
piped, fomewhat more than a foot in length, and half
a foot high, the longeft fide being parallel to the ho¬
rizon. Its light wTas fo ftrong, that he could plainly
difeern by it part of a neighbouring hedge and the
water of the river 5 only in the call corner of it the
light was rather faint, and the fquare figure lefs per-
fe61, as if it was cut off or darkened by the fegment of
a circle. On examining it a little nearer, he w7as fur-
prifed to find that it changed gradually from a bright
red, firft to a yellowifh, and then to a pale colour, in
proportion as he drew nearer; and when he came to
the place itfelf, it quite vanifhed. Upon this he Hep¬
ped back, and not only faw it again, but found that
the farther he wrent from it, the Hronger and brighter
it grew7. When he examined the place of this lumi¬
nous appearance, he could perceive no fmell nor any
other mark of fire.” This account was confirmed by
another gentleman, who informed M. Beccaria, that he
had feen the fame light five or fix different times in
fpring and in autumn ; and that it always appeared of
the fame fiiape, and in the very fame place. One night
m particular, he obferved it come out of a neighbouring
field to fettle in the ufual place.
A very remarkable account of an ignis fatuus is
given by Dr Shaw in his Travels to the Holy Land.
Jt appeared in the valleys of Mount Ephraim, and at¬
tended him and his company for more than an hour.
Sometimes it would appear globular, or in the fhape of
the flame of a candle ; at others it wTould fpread to fuch
a degree as to involve the whole company in a pale in-
offenfive light, then contradl itfelf, and fuddenly dif-
appear ; but in lefs than a minute would appear again j
fometimes running fwiftly along, it w'ould expand itfelf
at certain intervals over more than two or three acres
of the adjacent mountains. The atmofphtre from the
5 1 L 1 G
beginning 'of the evening had been remarkably thick
and hazy ; and the dew, as they felt it on the bridles
of their horfes, was very clammy and un&uous.
Lights refembling the ignis fatuus are fometimes
obferved at fea, fkipping about the mafis and rigging
of fiiips 3 and Dr Shaw informs us, that he has feen
thefe in fuch weather as that juH mentioned when he
faw the ignis fatuus in Paleffine. Similar appearances
have been obferved in various other fituations 3 and we
are told of one which appeared about the bed of a
woman in Milan, furrounding it as w7ell as her body
entirely. This light fled from the hand which ap¬
proached it 3 but was at length entirely difperfed by the
motion of the air. Of the fame kind alfo, mofl pro¬
bably, are thofe fmall luminous appearances which fome¬
times appear in houfes or near them, called in Scot¬
land Elf candles, and which are fuppofed to portend
the death of fome perfon about the houfe. In general
thefe lights are harmlefs, though not always 3 for w7e
have accounts of fome luminous vapours which would
encompafs flacks of hay and corn, and fet them on
fire 3 fo that they became obje&s of great terror and
concern to the country people. Of thefe it was
obferved, that they would avoid a drawn fword, or
fharp-pointed iron inflrument, and that they would
•be driven away by a great noife 3 both which methods
were made ufe of to diflipate them : and it w7as like-
wife obferved, that they came from fome diflance, as it
wrere on purpofe to do mifehief.
Several philofophers have endeavoured to account
for thefe appearances, but hitherto with no great
fuccefs 3 nor indeed does there feem to be fufficient
data for folving all their phenomena. Willoughby,
Ray, and others, have imagined that the light was
occafioned by a number of fhining infefts ; but this
opinion was never fupported in fuch a manner as
to gain much ground. The ignis fatuus feen by Dr
Derham above mentioned, as wrell as all the other in¬
fiances we have related feem to demonflrate the
contrary. Sir Ifaac Newton calls it a vapour finn¬
ing without heat; and fuppofes that there is the fame
difference between the vapour of ignis fatuus and
flame, that there is between the finning or rotten
wood and burning coals. But though this feems gene¬
rally to be the cafe, there are Hill fome exceptions,
as has been inflanced in the vapours which fet fire to
the flacks of corn. Dr Prieftley fuppofes that the light
is of the fame nature with that produced by putref-
cent fubftances 3 and others are of opinion, that the
eledlrical fluid is principally concerned; but none
have attempted to give any-particular folution of the
phenomena.
From the frequent appearance of the ignis fatuus
in marfhes, moift ground, burying places, and dung¬
hills, we are naturally led to conclude^ that putrefaction
is concerned in the prodli£tion of it. This procefs,
we know7, is attended with the emiflion of an aqueous
fleam, together with a quantity of fixed, inflammable,
and azotic airs, all blended together in the form
of vapour. It is likewife attended with fome de¬
gree of heat 3 and we know7 that there are fome va¬
pours, that of fulphur particularly, which become lu--
minous, with a degree of heat much lefs than that fuffi¬
cient to fet fire to combuftible bodies. There is no
inconfiftency, therefore, in fuppofing that the putrid
vapour
L I G [ i
, vapour may be capable of fhining with a ftill fmaller
v degree of heat than that of fulphur, and confequently
become luminous by that which putrefa&ion alone af¬
fords. This wmuld account for the ignis fatuus, were
it only a fteady luminous vapour arifmg from places
where putrid matters are contained j but its extreme
mobility, and flying from one place to another on the
approach of any perfon, cannot be accounted for on this
principle. If one quantity of the putrid vapour be¬
comes luminous by means of heat, all the reft ought
to do fo likewife ; fo that, though we may allow heat
and putrefaction to be concerned, yet of neceffity we
muft have recourfe to fome other agent, wdiich cannot
be any other than eleClricity. Without this, it is im-
poffible to conceive how any body of moveable vapour
Ihould not be carried away by the wind $ but fo far is
this from being the cafe, that the ignes fatui, defcribed
by M. Beccaria, were but little affe&ed by the wind.
It is belides proved by undoubted experiment, that
ele&ricity always is attended with fome degree of heat;
and this, however fmall, may be fufficient to give a lu¬
minous property to any vapour on which it a£ts ftrong-
ly ; not to mention, that the eledtric fluid itfelf is no
other than that of light, and may therefore by its adlion
eafily produce a luminous appearance independent of
, any vapour.
We have a ftrong proof that eledlricity is con¬
cerned, or indeed the principal agent, in producing
the ignis fatuus, from an experiment related by Dr
Prieftley of a flame of this kind being artificially pro¬
duced. A gentleman, who had been making many
ele&rical experiments for a whole afternoon in a fmall
room, on going out of it, obferved a flame following
him at fome little diftance, This, we have no reafon
to doubt, was a true ignis fatuus, and the circumftances
neceffary to produce it were then prefent, viz. an at-
mofphere impregnated with animal vapour, and like¬
wife ftrongly eleftrified. Both thefe circumftances un¬
doubtedly muft have taken place in the prefent cafe ;
for the quantity of perfpiration emitted by a human-
body is by no means inconfiderable j and it, as well as
the eledricity, would be colle&ed by reafon of the
fmallnefs of the room. In this cafe, however, there
feems to have been a confiderable difference between
the artificial ignis fatuus and thofe commonly met with;
for this flame followed the gentleman as he went out
of the room; but the natural ones commonly fly
from thofe who approach them. This may be ac¬
counted for, from a difference between the eledlricity
of the atmofphere in the one room and the other; in
which cafe the flame would naturally be attrafted to¬
wards that place where the ele&ricity was either dif¬
ferent in quality or in quantity; but in the natural
way, where all bodies may be fuppofed equally elec¬
trified for a great way round, a repulfion will as natu¬
rally take place. Still, however, this does not feem to
be always the cafe. In thofe inftances where travellers
have been attended by an ignis fatuus, we cannot fup-
pofe it to have been influenced by any other, power than
what we call attraBion, and which electricity is very
capable of producing. Its keeping at fome diftance is
likewife eafily accounted for ; as we know that bodies
poffeffed of different quantities of eleftricity may be
made to attratt one another for a certain fpace, and
then repel without having ever come into contaft.
i
6 ] L I G
On this principle we may account for the light which Light.
furrounded the woman at Milan, but fled from the' v—-
hand of any other perfon. On the fame principle may
we account for thefe mifchievous vapours which fet
fire to the hay and corn ftacks, but were driven away
by pjefenting to them a pointed iron inftrument, or by
making a noife. Both thefe are known to have a great
effed upon the ele&ric matter ; and by means of either,
even lightning may occafionally be made to fall upon
or to avoid particular places, according to the circum¬
ftances by which the general mafs happens to be affeded
at that time.
On the whole, therefore, it feems moft probable, that
the ignis fatuus is a colledion of vapour of the pu-
trefcent kind, very much affeded by eledricity; ac¬
cording to the degree of which, it will either give a
weak or ftrong light, or even fet fire to certain fub-
ftances difpofed to receive its operation. This opinion
feems greatly to be confirmed from fome luminous ap¬
pearances obferved in privies, where the putrid vapours
have even colleded themfelves into balls, and exploded
violently on the approach of a candle. This laft effed,
however, we cannot fo well afcribe to the eledricity, as
to the accenfion of the inflammable air which frequently
abounds in fuch places.
In the appendix to Dr Prieftley’s third volume of
Experiments and Obfervations on Air, Mr Warltire
gives an account of fome very remarkable ignes fatui,
which he obferved on the road to Bromfgrove, about
five miles from Birmingham. The time of obfervation
wras the 12th of December 1776, before day-light. A
great many ©f thefe lights were playing in an adjacent
field, in different diredions ; from lome of which there
fuddenly fprung up bright branches of light, fomething
refembling. the explofion of a rocket that contained
many brilliant ftars, if the difcharge was upwards, in-
ftead of the ufual diredion ; and the hedge and trees
on each fide of the hedge were illuminated. This ap¬
pearance continued but a few feconds, and then the
jack-a-lanterns played as before. Mr Warltire was not
near enough to obferve if the apparent explofions w'ere
attended with any report.
Cronftedt gives it as his opinion, that ignis fatuust
as well as the meteors called falling Jlars, are owing to
colledions of inflammable air railed to a great height
in the atmofphere. But, with regard to the latter,
the vaft height at which they move evidently ftiows
that they cannot be the effed of any gravitating vapour
whatever; for the lighteft inflammable air is one-twelfth
.of that ol the common atmofphere ; and we have no
reafon to believe, that at the diftance of 40 or 50 miles
from the earth, the latter has near one-twelfth of its
weight at the furface. From the account given by
Mr Warltire, w'e Ihould be apt to conclude, that there
is a ftrong affinity betwixt the ignes fatui and fire balls, -
infomuch that the one might be very eafily converted
into the other. From this then we muft afcribe an
eledrical origin to the one as w^ell as the other. Elec¬
tricity, we know, can affume both thefe appearances, as
is evident in the cafe of points: or even when the at¬
mofphere is violently eledrified, as around the firing
of an eledrical kite, which ahvays wrill appear to be
furrounded with a blue flame in the night, if the elec¬
tricity be very ftrong.
On the whole, it appears, that eledricity ading up¬
on
L I G [i
Light, on a fmall quantity of atmofpherical air, with a certain
1 " v— ' degree of vigour, will produce an appearance refem-
bling an ignis fatuus; with a fuperior force it will pro¬
duce a fire ball; and a hidden increafe of electrical
power might produce thofe fparks and apparent ex-
plofions obferved by Mr Warltire. The only diffi¬
culty therefore is, Why does eleCtricity exert its power
upon one portion of the atmofphere rather than an¬
other, feeing it has an opportunity of diffufing itfelf
equally through the whole ? To this it leetns im-
poffible to give any other reafon than that we fee the
fa£t is lo ; and that in all cafes where there is a quan¬
tity of eleCfrified air or vapour, there will be an accu¬
mulation in one part rather than another. Thus, in
the experiment already related, where the gentleman
perceived a blue flame following him, the whole air
of the room was {leftrified, but the greateft power of
the fluid was exerted on that w'hich gave the luminous
appearance.
With regard to the ufes of the ignes fatui in the
fyftem of nature, we can only fay, that they feem to
be accidental appearances refulting from the motion of
the eleftric fluid, and, no doubt, like other meteors
fubfervient to the prefervation of its equilibrium, and
thus are ufeful in preventing thofe dreadful commo¬
tions which enfue when a proper medium for fo doing
is deficient.
Phofphoric A light in fome refpecls fimilar to thofe above men-
light. tioned has been found to proceed from that celebrated
chemical production called phofphorus, which always
tends to decompofe itfelf, fo as to take fire by the accefs
of air only. Phofphorus, therefore, wdien it emits
light, is properly a body ignited ; though when a very
fmall quantity of it is ufed, as what is left after draw¬
ing it over paper, or what may be diffolved in effential
oil, the heat is not fenfible. But perhaps the matter
which emits the light in what w7e call putrefcent fub-
Jiances may be fimilar to it, though it be generated by
a different procefs, and burn with a lefs degree of heat.
Putrefcence does not feem to be neceflary to the light
of glow-worms or of the pholades*, and yet their light
is fufficiently fimilar to that of fhining wood or flelh.
EleClric light is unquellionably fimilar to that of phof¬
phorus, though the fource of it is apparently very dif¬
ferent.
Kunckel formed his phofphorus into a kind of pills
about the fize of peas, which being moiffened a little,
and fcraped in the dark, yielded a very confiderable
light, but not without fmoke. The light was much
more pleafing when eight or ten of thefe pills were put
into a glafs of water; for being fhaken in the dark,
the whole glafs feemed to be filled with light. Kunc¬
kel alfo reduced his phofphorus into the form of larger
Hones; which being wanned by a perfon’s hand, and
rubbed upon paper, would defcribe letters that were
very legible in the dark.
I he greateft variety of experiments with the light
of phofphorus was made by Dr Slare ; who fays, that
the liquid phofphorus (which is nothing more than the
folid phofphorus diffolved in any of the effential oils)
would not hurt even a lady’s hand ; or that, when the
hands or face were waftied with it, it would not only
make them vifible to other perfons in the dark, but that
the light was fo confiderable as to make other neigh¬
bouring objeCls vifible.
Vog. XII. Part I.

When the folid phofphorus is quite immerfed in wa¬
ter, he obferves that it ceafes to ihine ; but that if any
part of it chance to emerge, or get into the air, it will
Ihine though the glafs be hermetically fealed. In a
large glafs he kept it without water for feveral daysj
and yet it continued fhining, with very little diminu¬
tion of its light or weight. If the letters that were writ¬
ten with this phofphorus were warmed by the fire, they
prefently became dark lines, which continued upon the
paper, like ink. To try how much light was given by
a fmall quantity of this phofphorus, he obferved that
it continued to flame in the open air for feven or
eight days ; the light being vifible whenever he ihut
his window.
As air was generally thought to contain the pabu¬
lum of flame, Dr Slare was determined to try this with
refpeCt to phofphorus; and for this purpofe he placed
a large piece of it in a receiver ; but upon exhaufting
it, be perceived that it became more luminous, and
that, upon admitting the air, it returned to its former
ftate. This property of the light of phofphorus, which
is the very reverfe of that of fhining wood and fifties,
was alfo afcertained by feveral very accurate experi¬
ments of Mr Haukfbee’s.
Endeavouring to blow the phofphorus into a flame
with a pair of bellows, Dr Slare found that it was pre-
fently blown out, and that it was a confiderable time
before the light revived again. All liquors would ex-
tinguiifi this light when the phofphorus was put into
them ; nor would it (bine or burn, though it was even
boiled in the moll inflammable liquors, as oil of olives,
fpirit of turpentine, or even fpirit of wine.
In order to keep his phofphorus from confuming,
he ufed to put it in a glafs of water ; and fometimes he
has feen it, when thus immerfed in water, make fuch
bright and vigorous corufcations in the air, as, he fays,
would furprife and frighten thofe who are not ufed to
the phenomenon. This fiery meteor, he fays, is con-
tradled in its paffage through the water, but expands
as foon as it gets above it. If any perfon would make
this experiment to advantage, he informs them that the
glafs muft be deep and cylindrical, and not above three
quarters filled with water. This effedl he perceived in
warm weather only, and never in cold.
The phofphorus of which we have been treating is
prepared from urine ; but in fome cafes the fweat,
which is fimilar to urine, has been obferved to be
phofphoraceous, without any preparation. This once Acla Cafa-
happened to a perfon who ufed to eat great quantities
of fait, and who was a little fubjedl to the gout, after vo1- v*
fweating with violent exercife. Stripping himfelf in P‘ ,334‘

prifed him very much. Upon examination, red fpots
were found upon his fhirt ; and the phyfician who was
prefent perceived an urinous fmell, though it had no¬
thing in it of volatile alkali, but of the muriatic acid:
the fame, he fays, that iffues from cabbage much fail¬
ed, and ftrongly fermented.
The eafieft method of accounting for all thefe kindsAI1 the^
of lights, perhaps, is from elearicity. If light confifts lighttS

place, there light muft appear, whether in putrefcent *See
animal fubftances, fea water, phofphorus, or any thing tncity'
elfe. We know that the electric matter pervades all

L I G [ i
light terrefiiial fubffarices, and is very liable to be fet in mo-
tion from caufes of which we are ignorant. The ac¬
tion of the air by which putrefaction is produced may
be one of thefe caufes ; and it can by no means appear
furpriiing that the ele&ric matter Ihould a£t in the bo¬
dies o'7 living animats in fuch a manner as to produce a
permanent light, when we certainly know it aCts in
feme of them fo powerfully as to produce a fhockfnni-
lar to that of a charged phial. On this fubjeft we
fhali only obferve farther, that whert this vibration be¬
comes to powerful as to penetrate the folid fubftance of
the body itfeif, the luminous body then becomes tranf-
parent, as in the milk mentioned in the former part of
this article ; but when it is only fuperficial, the body,
though it emits light, is itfeif opaque.
Light from Diamonds. Among luminous bodies the
diamond is to be reckoned } as fome diamonds are known
to fhine in the dark. But on account of the feeblenefs
of their fplendour, it is neceffary for the perfon who is
to obferve them, previoudy to ftay in the dark at lealt
a quarter of an hour \ that the pupil of the eye may
be dilated and enlarged, and fo rendered capable of
receiving a large quantity of the rays of light. M. du
Fay has alfo obferved, that the eyes ought to be Ihut
for this time, or at lead: one of them ; and that, in that
cafe, the light of the diamond is afterwards only feen by
that eye which has been (hut. Before the diamond is
brought into the dark room, it mud be expofed to the
funlhine, or at lead to the open daylight, to imbibe
a fufficient quantity of rays j and this is done in one
minute, or even lefs; eight or ten feconds having
been found to furnifh as much light as a done is ca¬
pable of receiving : and when brought into the dark,
its light continues about twelve or thirteen minutes,
weakening all the while; by infenfible degrees. It is
very remarkable, that in bodies fo extremely limilar to
each other as diamonds are, forae Ihould have this pro¬
perty of imbibing the fun’s rays, and Ihining in the
dark, and that others diould not j yet fo it is found
to be by experiment, and the mod nearly refembling
dones lhall be found one to have this property, and
another to be deditute of it j while many of the mod
didimilar have the property in common. There feems
to be no rule, nor even the lead traces of any imper-
feft rule of judging, which diamonds have, and which
have not this property •, their natural brightnefs, their
purity, their fize, or their lhape, contribute nothing to
it: and all that has been yet difeovered of the lead re¬
gularity among them, is, that all yellow diamonds
have this property. This is fuppofed to arife from
their having more fulphur in their compofition, and
therefore illuminating more readily, or emitting a more
vilible flame.
The burning of diamonds is a term ufed among the
jewellers, for putting them into a fierce fire, as they
frequently do, when they are fouled with brown, or
yellow, or the like j this always diverts them of their
colour, without doing them the lead fenfible injury.
M. du Fay, having been informed of this common prac¬
tice, formed a conje&ure, that the difference of dia¬
monds in their diining or not diming in the dark, was
owing to it; and that either all thofe which had been
burnt, or all thofe which had not, were thofe which
alone fhone in the dark. But this was found an erro¬
neous conje&ure j for two diamonds, one lucid in the
8 ] L I G
dark, the other not, were both burnt, and afterwards Light,
both were found to retain the fame properties they tf*—
had before. It is not only the open funfliine, or open
daylight, which gives to thtlc diamonds the power of
Ihining in the dark ; they receive it in the fame manner
even it laid under a glafs, or plunged in water or in
milk.
M. du Fay tried whether it was pofiible to make the
diamond retain, for any longer time, the light it natu¬
rally parts with fo foon : and found, that if the dia¬
mond, after being expofed to the light, be covered with
black wax, it will thine in the dark, as well fix hours
afterwards as at the time it was firtt impregnated with
the light.
The imbibing light, in this manner^ being fo nice
a property as not to be found in feveral diamonds, it
was not to be fuppofed that it would be found in any
other ftones : accordingly, on trial, the ruby, the fap-
phire, and the topaz, wxre found wholly deffitute of
it \ and among a large number of rough emeralds, one
only was found to poffcfs it. Such is the itrange un¬
certainty of thefe accidents.
All the other lefs precious ftones were tried, and
found not to poffefs this property of imbibing light
from the daylight or funftiine, but they all became
luminous by the different means of heating or fri&ion :
with this difference, that fome acquired it by one of
thefe methods, and others by the other ; each being
unaffefted by that which gave the property to the
other. The diamond becomes luminous by all thefe
ways.
Beccarius alfo difeovered, that diamonds have the
property of the Bolognian phofphorus, about the fame
time that it occurred to M. du Fay. Com. Bonon.
vol. ii. p. 276. M. du Fay likewife obferved, that the
common topaz, when calcined, had all the properties of
this phofphorus j and purfuing the difeovery, he found
the fame property, in a great degree, in the belemni-
tes> gyp^m, limeftone, and marble : though he was
obliged to diffolve fome very hard fubftances of this
kind in acids, before calcination could produce this
change in them $ and with fome fubftances he could
not fucceed even thus j efpecially with flint ftones, ri¬
ver fand, jafpers, agates, and rock cryftal.
Light from Plants. In Swreden a very curious phe¬
nomenon has been obferved on certain flowers by M.
Haggern, le&urer in natural hiftory. One evening
he perceived a faint flafh of light repeatedly dart from
a marigold. Surprifed at fuch an uncommon appear¬
ance, he refolved to examine it with attention j and,
to be affured it was no deception of the eye, he placed
a man near him, with orders to make a fignal at the
moment when he obferved the light. They both faw
it conftantly at the fame moment.
The light was moft brilliant on marigolds of an
orange or flame colour j but fcarcely viftble on pale
ones.
The flafti was frequently feen on the fame flower two
or three times in quick fucceflion , but more common¬
ly at intervals of feveral minutes : and when feveral
flowers in the fame place emitted their light together,
it could be obferved at a confiderable diftance.
This phenomenon was remarked in the months of
July and Auguft at funfet, and for half an hour, when
the atmofphere was clear j but after a rainy day, or
when

when the air was loaded with vapours, nothing of it
was feen.
The following flowers emitted flaflies, more or lefs
vivid, in this order :
1. The marigold, calendula officinalis.
2. Monk’s-hood, tropceolum majus.
3. The orange lily, lilium bulbiferum.
4. The Indian pink, tagetes patula et erecla.
To difcover whether fome little infedls or phofpho-
ric worms might not be the caufe of it, the flowers
were carefully examined, even with a microfcope, with¬
out any fuch thing being found.
From the rapidity of the flalh, and other circumftan-
ces, it may be conje&ured that there is fomething of
electricity in this phenomenon. It is well known, that
when the piftil of a flower is impregnated, the pollen
burfts away by its elafticity, with which eleCtricity may
be combined. But M. Haggern, after having obferved
the flafli from the orange lily, the antherae of which are
a confiderable fpace diftant from the petals, found that
the light proceeded from the petals only •, whence he
concludes, that this eleClric light is caufed by the pol¬
len, which, in flying off, is fcattered on the petals.
Whatever be the caufe, the effeft is Angular and highly
curious.
Lights, in Painting, are thofe parts of a piece
which are illuminated, or that lie open to the luminary
by whif.i the piece is fuppofed to be enlightened j and
which, for this reafon, are painted in bright vivid co¬
lours.
In this fenfe, light is oppofed to fliadow-.
Different lights have very different effedls on a pic¬
ture, and occafion a difference in the management of
every part. A great deal therefore depends on the
painter’s choofing a proper light for his piece to be
illuminated by 5 and a great deal more, in the conduCt
of the lights and (hadows, when the luminary is pitch¬
ed upon.
The ftrength and relievo of a figure, as well as its
gracefulnefs, depend entirely on the management of
the lights, and the joining of thofe to the lhadovrs.
The light a figure receives is either direft or refleCI-
ed ; to each *f which fpecial regard muff be had. The
doCtrine of lights and ihadows makes that part of
painting called clair-obfcure.

coutred, and armed at all points. See Ligbt-HoRss.
Light-Hou/c, a building ere&ed upon a cape or pro¬
montory on the fea coaft, or upon fome rock in the

attended by fome careful perfon, fo as to be feen at a

doubtful. Lamp-lights are, on many accounts, pre¬
ferable to coal fires or candles ; and the effedt of thefe
may be increafed by placing them either behind glafs

LIGHTFOOT, John, a moft learned Englilh di¬
vine, w7as the fon of a divine, and born in March
1602, at Stoke upon Trent in Staffordftnre. After
having finiflied his ftudies at a fchool on Morton-green
near Congleton in Cheftiire, he wTas removed in 16
to Cambridge, where he applied himfelf to eloquence,
and fucceeded fo well in it as to be thought the bell;
orator of the under graduates in the univerfity. He
alfo made an extraordinary proficiency in the Latin
and Greek , but neglected the Hebrew, and even loft
that knowledge he brought of it from fchool. His
tafte for the oriental languages was not yet excited ;
and as for logic, the ftudy of it as managed at that
time among the academics, was too quarrelfome and
fierce for his quiet and meek difpofition. As foon as
he had taken the degree of B. A. he left the univer¬
fity, and became afliftant to a fchool at Repton in
Derbyfliire. After he had fupplied this place a year
or two, he entered into orders, and became curate of
Norton under Hales in Shroplhire. This curacy gave
an occafion of awakening his genius for the Hebrew
tongue. Norton lies near Bellaport, then the feat of
Sir Rowland Cotton ; who w’as his conftant hearer,
made him his chaplain, and took him into his houfe.
This gentleman being a perfeft mafter of the Hebrew
language, engaged Lightfoot in that ftudy •, who, by
converfing with his patron, foon became fenfible that
without that knowledge it was impofiible to attain an
accurate underftanding of the feriptures. He there¬
fore applied himfelf to it with extraordinary vigour,
and in a little time made a great progrefs in it : and
his patron removing with his family to refide in Lon¬
don, at the requeft of Sir Alland Cotton his uncle,
who was lord-mayor of that city, he followed his pre¬
ceptor thither. But he did not flay long there : for,
having a mind to improve himfelf by travelling abroad,
he went down into Staffordfliire to take leave of his
father and mother. Faffing through Stone in that
county, he found the place deliitute of a minifler : and
the prefling inflances of the pariftiioners prevailed up¬
on him to undertake that cure. Hereupon, laying
afide his riefign of travelling abroad, he began to turn
his thoughts upon fettling at home. During his refi-
dence at Bellaport, he had fallen into the acquaintance
of a gentlewoman who was daughter of William
Crompton of Stonepark, Efq. and now, being in pof-
feiTion of that living, he manied her in 1628. But
notwithflanding this fettlemcnt, his unquenchable thirft
after rabbinical learning would not fuffer him to con¬
tinue there. Sion-college library at London, he knew,

Lightfoot. ^ ^vas well Hocked with books of that kind. He there-
' tore quitted his charge at Stone, and removed with his
family to Hornfey, near the city ; where he gave the
public a notable fpecimen of his advancement in thofe
Hudies, by his “ Erubhim, or Mifcellanies Chriftian
and Judaical,” in 1629. He was at this time only
27 years of age 5 and appears to have been well ac¬
quainted with the Latin and the Greek fathers, as well
as the ancient heathen writers. Thefe firil fruits of
lis (Indies were dedicated to Sir Rowland Cotton j
who, in 1631, prefented him to the reflory of Afliley
in Staffordlhire.
^ fie feemed now to be fixed for life : Accordingly,
he built a (ludy in the garden, to be out of the noife
o( tne houfe 5 and applied himfelt with indefatigable
diligence in fearching the feriptures. Thus employ¬
ed, the days palled very agreeably 5 and he continued
quiet and. unmolefted, till the great change which
happened in the public affairs brought him into a (hare
of the adminidration relating to the church j for he
w as. nominated a member of the memorable affembly
of divines for fettling a new form of ecclefiadical po-
hty: This appointment was purely the effe£l of his
didinguidied merit j and he accepted it purely with a
view to ferve his country, as far as lay in his power.
The non-refidence, which this would neceffarily occa-
fion, apparently induced him to refign his re&ory :
and having obtained the prefentation for a younger
biother, he let out for London in 1642. He had now
fatisfied himfelf in clearing up many of the abdrufed
palfages in the Bible, and therein had provided the chief
materials, as well as formed the plan, of his “ Harmo¬
ny and an opportunity of infpetting it at the prefs
was, no doubt, an additional motive for his going to
the capital : where he had not been long before he
vras chofen minider of St Bartholomew’s, behind the
Royal Exchange. 1 he afiembly of divines meeting in
°tir author gave his attendance diligently there,
and made a didinguilhed figure in their debates ; w'here
he tiled great freedom, and gave fignal proofs of his
courage as well as learning, in oppofing many of thofe
tenets which the divines were endeavouring to edablilh.
His learning recommended him to the parliament,
whofe vifitors, having ejedled Ur William Spurdow’
trom the maderfhip of Catharine-hall in Cambridge,
put Lightfqot in his room, this year i6?3 j and he
was aifo prefented to the living of Much-Munden in
Hertford (hire, void by the death of Dr Samuel Ward,
Margaret-profeflbr of divinity in that univerfity, before
the expiration of this year. Meanwhile he had his turn
tvith other favourites in preaching before the houfe of
commons, mod of which fermons were printed •, and in
them we fee him warmly preffing the fpeedy fettlement
of the church in the Prefhyterian form, which he cor¬
dially believed to be according to the pattern in the
Mount. He was all the while employed in preparing
and publifiung the feveral branches of his Harmony • all
which were fo many excellent fpecimens of the ufeful-
nefs of human learning to true religion : and he met
with great difficulties and difeouragements in that work,
chiefly from that antieruditional fpirit which prevailed’
and even threatened the deffruftion of the univerfities!
In 1655 he entered upon the office of vice-chancellor
of Cambridge, to which he u’as chofen that year, hav¬
ing taken the degree of doftor of divinity in 1652.

l i d
He performed all the regular exercifes for his degree Ligfitfoot,
with great applaufe, and executed the vice-chancellor’s lighting,
office wuth exemplary diligence and fidelity ; and, par- '
ticularly at the commencement, fupplied the place of
profeflbr of divinity, then undifpofed of, as an aft which
was kept for a doftor’s degree in that profeffion. At
the fame time he was engaged with others in perfecting
the Polyglott Bible, then in the prefs. At the Refto-
ration he offered to refign the mafterflnp of Catharine-
hall : But, as what he had done had been rather in
compliance with the neceffity of the times than from
any zeal or fpirit of oppofition to the king and govern¬
ment, a confirmation w'as granted him from the crown,
both of the place and of his living. Soon after this he
was appointed one of the afliftants at the conference
upon the liturgy, which was held in the beginning of
1661, but attended only once or twice j probably dif-
gufted at the heat with which that conference was ma¬
naged. However, he (luck clofe to his defign of per-
feCling his Harmony : and being of a ftrong and heal¬
thy conftitution, which was affifted by-an exact tem¬
perance, he profecuted his ftudies with unabated vi¬
gour to the laft, and continued .to publifli, notwith-
ftanding the many difficulties he met with from the ex¬
pence of it. However, not long before he died, fome
bookfellers got a promife from him to colleR and me-
thodife his works, in order to print them ; but the exe¬
cution was prevented by his death, which happened
Dec. 6. 1675. The doClor was twice married : his
firit wife, already mentioned, brought him four fons
and. two daughters. His fecond wife was likewife
a widow, and relift of Mr Auftin Brograve, uncle of
Sir Thomas Brograve, Bart of Hertfordihire, a gen¬
tleman well verfed in rabbinical learning, and a parti¬
cular acquaintance of our author. He had no ifllic by
her. She alfo died before him, and was buried in
Munden church ; where the doftor was himfelf like¬
wife interred near both his wives. Dr Lightfoot’s
works were colle&ed and publilhed firft in 1684, in
two volumes folio. The fecond edition was printed at
Amfterdam, 1686, in two volumes folio, containing all
his. Latin writings, with a Latin tranflation of thofe
which he Wrote in Engliffi. At the end of both ’thefe
editions there is a lift of fuch pieces as he left unfiniffi-
ed. It is the chief of thefe, in Latin, which make
up. the third volume, added to the former two, in a
third edition of his works, by John Leufden, at Utrecht,
in 1699, fobo. They were communicated by Mr
Strype, who, in 1700, publiffied anorher collection of
thefe papers, under the title of “ Same genuine re¬
mains of the late pious and learned Dr John Lieht-
foot.”
LIGHTING OF Streets. This invention, which is
generally confidered as of modern date, contributes
greatly to the convenience and fafety of the inhabitants
of large cities, as well as to the ornament ©f their
ftreets. It is not probable that the ftreets of ancient
Rome were lighted, fince the Romans confidered the
ufe of flambeaux and lanterns to be fo necelTary in re¬
turning home from their no&urnal vifits. It appears
that fuch as walked the rtreets without thefe went home
in darknefs j and the return of Gito in the night-time,
of which Petronius makes mention, clearly proves that
the ftreets of Naples were not lighted. Such as have
aferibed a remote antiquity to the lighting of ftreets,
feem
Lighting, feem to have miftaken it for what are called illumina-
*—-'vr—tions, which indeed are of great antiquity. Egyptians,
Jews, Greeks, and Romans, during the celebration of
memorable feftivals, were in the habit of illuminating
their houfes ; but this is entirely different from the prac¬
tice which we are now confidering.
Paris was probably the firft city in modem times, the
ilreels of which were lighted, about the beginning of
the 16th century, as they were very much infeded by
robbers and incendiaries. This occafioned an edift,
iffued in 1524, commanding the inhabitants, whofe
windows fronted the ftreet, to keep lights burning af¬
ter nine o’clock at night. In 1558, falots were placed
at the corners of the tlreets; but when thefe were too
long to receive benefit from the light of one, three were
ereiffed in different parts of it. The city of Paris had
then 91 2 ilreets, and the number of lights rather under
2736 ; but in the fame year thefe were changed for
lanterns, of a fimilar conftruflion with thofe ufed at
prefent.
In 1671, the lanterns were ordered to be lighted
every year from the 20th October to the end of March
the enfuing year. Some time after this a premium was
offered for a differtation on the belt means of improving
the lighting of the ftreets, when a journeyman glazier
obtained a premium of 200 livres, and Meffrs Bailly,
le Roy, and Bourgeois de Chateaublanc, 2000 livres.
The lamps of Paris amounted to 5772 in the year
1721, and in 1771, to 6232. The city of Nantz was
lighted in 1777, and had no fewer than 300 lamps in
the year 1780.
The inhabitants of the city of London were ordered,
in 1688, to hang out lanterns duly at the accuftomed
time, which was renewed in 1690 and in 1716 it was
enabled, that all thofe whofe houfes fronted any ftreet,
lane, or public paffage, fliould hang out one or more
lights, which were to burn from 6 o’clock to 11. But
as the time of lighting them was rertridled to 117
nights in the year, on which account many depreda¬
tions were eafily committed by thieves and robbers, the
lord mayor and council applied for, and obtained an aft
of parliament, empowering them to light the ftreets in
a better manner. In confequence of this aft, the lamps
were increafed from ICOO to 4769, and afterwards to
5000. But as thefe were confined to the city and li¬
berties, about one-fifth of the whole of London, the
number of lamps could not be lefs than 15,000. The
continuance of their burning was alfo increafed from
750 to 5000 hours. In 1744, another aft wyas obtain¬
ed to regulate ftill farther the lighting of the city, and
it was placed on the footing on which it Hands at pre¬
fent. Thefe are nov? fo numerous, that Oxford ftreet
alone is faid to contain more lamps than the whole city
of Paris. Birmingham was lighted for the firft time in
I733> with 700 lamps.
In 1669, Amfterdam was lighted by lanterns 5 the
Hague in 1553 was lighted in a particular manner, but
lamps were not fixed up in all the ftreets till the year
J678. The ftreets of Copenhagen wxre lighted in
1681, the plan of which w’as much improved in T683.
Berlin at prefent has 2354 lamps, kept lighted from
September to May at the expence of the fovereign.
Vienna began to be lighted in 1687, and lamps were
introduced in 1704. In 1776 their number amounted
to 2000, which was increafed to 3000, to be lighted at
] L 1 G
the annual expence of 30,000 florins. Leipzig was Lightning
lighted in 1702, Drefden in 1705, Caffel in 1721, afid H
Gottingen in 1735. A praftice fo beneficial to the. <
fafety and convenience of mankind, has been very lau¬
dably imitated by almoft every city and town in Europe.

LIGHTNING, a bright and vivid flaftr of fire,
fuddenly appearing in the atmofphere, and commonly
difappearing in an inftant, fometimes attended with
clouds and thunder, and fometimes not. For an ac¬
count of the phenomena of lightning, and of the opi¬
nions concerning it, fee Electricity Index.
Artificial Lightning. Before the difeoveries of
Dr Franklin concerning the identity of eleftricity
and lightning, many contrivances were invented in
order to reprefent this terrifying phenomenon in mi¬
niature : the corufcations of phofphorus in warm rvea-
ther, the accenfion of the vapour of fpirit of wane
evaporated in a clofe place, See. wrere ufed in order to
fupport the hypothefis which at that time prevailed;
namely, that lightning was formed of fome fulphu-
reous, nitrous, or other combuftible vapours, floating
in long trains in the atmofphere, which by fome un¬
accountable means took fire, and produced all the
deftruftive effefts of that phenomenon. Thefe repre-
fentations, however, are now no more exhibited j
and the only true artificial lightning is univerfally ac¬
knowledged to be the difeharge of eleftric matter from
bodies in which it is artificially fet in motion by ma¬
chines.
Lightning was looked upon as facred both by the
Greeks and Romans, and was fuppofed to be fent to
execute vengeance on the earth : Hence perfons kill¬
ed with lightning, being thought hateful to the gods,
were buried apart by themfelves, left the afhes of other
men fhouid receive pollution from them. Some fay
they were interred upon the very fpot where they died j
others will have it that they had no interment, but
were fuffered to rot where they fell, becaufe it was
unlawful for any man to approach the place. For
this reafon the ground vras hedged in, left any perfon
unawares fhouid contraft pollution fiom it. All
places ftruck with lightning were carefully avoided and
fenced round, out of an opinion that Jupiter had ei¬
ther taken offence at them, and fixed upon them the
marks of his difpleafure, or that he had, by this means,
pitched upon them as facred to himfelf. The ground
thus fenced about was called by the Romans bidentul.
Lightning was much obferved in augury, and was a
good or bad omen, according to the circumftances at¬
tending it.

•LIGURIA, in Ancient Geography^ a country of
Italy, bounded on the fouth by the Mediterranean fea,
on the north by the Apennine mountains, on the weft
by part of Iranfalpine Gaul, and on the eaft by Etru¬
ria. . There is a great difagreement among authors con¬
cerning the origin of the Ligurians, though moft pro¬
bably they were defeended from the Gauls. Some
carry up their origin as far as the fabulous heroes of
antiquity ; while others trace them from the Ligyes,
a people mentioned by Herodotus as attending Xerxes
‘in his expeditions againft Greece. I hefe Ligyes are
by fome ancient geographers placed in Colchis j by
■others, in Albania.—According to Diodorus Siculus,
the Ligurians led a very wretched life; their country
-being entirely overgrown with woods, which they
were obliged to pull up by the root, in order to cul¬
tivate their land, which was alfo encumbered with
great ftones, and, being naturally barren, made but
very poor returns for all their labour. They were
much addi&ed to hunting; and, by a life of continual
exercife and labour, became fo ftrong, that the weakeft
Ligurian was generally an overmatch for the ftrongeft
and moft robuft among the Gauls. The women are
faid to have been almoft as ftrong as the men, and to
have borne an equal fhare in all laborious enterpriles.
With all their bravery, however, they were not able
to refift the Roman power j but were fubdued by that
warlike nation, about 211 B. C.

LILBURNE, John, an enthufiaftic demagogue,
who was tyrannically punilhed by the ftar-chamber
court, being put in the pillory, whipped, lined, and
impnfoned, for importing and publilhing feditious
pamphlets, which he had got printed in Holland ;
they chiefly refleaed on the church of England and
its bilhops; he fullered in 1637, and in prifon was
doubly loaded with irons. In 1641, he was releafed
by the long parliament : and from this time he had
the addrefs to make himfelf formidable to all parties,
by his bold, afpiring genius. He fignalized himfelf
m the parliament army, and was at one time the
fecret friend and confidant of Cromwell, and at ano
ther his avowed enemy and accufer j fo that, in 1650,
Cromwell found it to be his intereft to filence him, by

grew outrageous againft the protedlor’s government} .11
became chief of the levellers; and was twice tri-d for L f

LILLO, George, an excellent dramatic writer,
was born at London in 1693. He was a jeweller by
profeffion, and followed his bulinefs for many years in
that neighbourhood with the faireft reputation. He
was at the fame time ftrongly attached to the mufes,
yet feemed to have laid it down as a maxim, that the
devotion paid to them ought always to tend to the
promotion of virtue, morality, and religion. In pur-
fuance of this aim, Lilly was happy in the choice of
his fubje&s, and Ihowed great power of affe&ing the
heart, by working up the paflions to fuch a height as
to render the diftreffes of common and domeftic life
equally interefting to the audiences as that of kings
and heroes, and the ruin brought on private families
by an indulgence of avarice, lull, &c. as the havock
made in ftates and empires by ambition, cruelty, or
tyranny. His “ George Barnwell,” “ Fatal Curiofi-
ty,” and “ Arden of Eeverftiam,” are all planned on
common and well known ftories ; yet they have per¬
haps more frequently drawn tears from an audience
than the more pompous tragedies of Alexander the
Great, All for Love, &c. In the prologue to “ El-
meric,”. which was not atted till after the author’s
death, it is faid, that when he wrote that play, he
“ was deprelfed by want,” and affiiaed by dileafe;
but in the former particular there appears to be evident¬
ly a miftake, as he died polfeffed of an eftate of 60I. a-
year, befides other effedls to a conliderable value. His
death happened in 1739, in the 47th year of his age.
His works have been collected, and publilhed, with an
account of his life, in 2 vols 1 2mo.
LILLY, John, a dramatic poet, was born in the
Wealds of Kent, about the year 15 $3, and educated in
Magdalen-college, Oxford, where he took the degree
of bachelor of arts in 1573, and that of mafter in
I575* From Oxford he removed to Cambridge } but
how long he continued there, is uncertain. \)n his
arrival in London, he became acquainted with fome of
Queen Elizabeth’s courtiers, by whom he was carefied,
and admired as a poet and a wit} and her majefty*
on particular feftivals, honoured his dramatic pieces
with her prefence. His plays are nine in number.
His firft publication, however, printed in 1580, was a
romance called Euphues, which was univerfally read and
admired. This romance, which Blount, the editor of
fix of his plays, fays introduced a new language, efpe-
cially among the ladies, is, according to Beikenhout,
in fadl a moft contemptible piece of affectation and*
non feme : neveithelefs it (eems very certain, that it
was in high eftimation by the women of fafliion of
thofe times, who, we are told by Whalley, the editor
of Ben Johnfon’s works, had all the phraies by heart}
and
L I L [ 23 ] L I M
Lilly, and thofe who did not fpeak Euphui/m were as little
—V" regarded at court as if they could not fpeak French.
“ He was (fays Oldys) a man of great reading, good
memory, ready faculty of application, and uncommon
eloquence ; but he ran into a vaft excefs of allufion.”
When or where he died is not known. Anthony Wood
fays he was living in 1597, when his laid: comedy was
publifned. After attending the court of Queen Eliza¬
beth 13 years, notwithftanding his reputation as an author,
he was under a necelfity of petitioning the queen for
feme fmall ftipend to fupport him in his old age. His
two letters or petitions to her majefly on this fubjecl
are preferved in manufeript.
Lilly, William, a noted Englilh aftrologer, born
in Leicelterfhire in 1602 } where his father not be¬
ing able to give him more learning than common
writing and arithmetic, he reiolved to feek his for-
tune in London. He arrived in 1620, and lived four
years as a fervant to a mantua-maker in the parifli of
St Clements Danes •, but then moved a ftep higher to
the fervice of Mr Wright, mailer of the Salters com¬
pany in the Strand, who not being able to write, Lilly
among other offices kept his books. In 1627, when
his mailer died, he paid his addrefles to the widow,
whom he married with a fortune of 1000I. Being now
his own mailer, he followed the puritanical preachers *,
and, turning his mind to judicial aftrology, became pu¬
pil to one Evans, a profligate Welffi parfon, in that
pretended art. Getting a MS. of the Ars Notitia of
Corn. Agrippa, with alterations, he drank in the doc¬
trine of the magic circle, and the invocation of fpi-
rits, with great eagernefs. He was the author of the
Merlinus Anglicus junior; The Supernatural Sight; and
The White King’s Prophecy. In him we have an in-
ftance of the general fuperllition and ignorance that
prevailed in the time of the civil war between Cha. I.
and his parliament : for the king confulted this allro-
loger to know in what quarter he ffiould conceal him-
felf, if he could efcape from Hampton court j and Ge¬
neral Fairfax, on the other fide, fent for him to his
army, to alk him if he could tell by his art, whether
God was with them and their caufe ? Lilly, who made
his fortune by favourable predidlions to both parties,
affured the general that God would be with him and
his army. In 1648, he publiffied his Treatife of the
Three Suns feen the preceding winter ; and alfo an
aftrological judgement upon a conjunction of Saturn
and Mars. This year the council of Hate gave him in
money 50I. and a penfion of 100I. per annum, which
he received for two years, and then refigned on fome
dilgult. In June 1660, he was taken into cuftody by
order of the parliament, by whom he was examined
concerning the perfon who cut off the head of King
Charles I. The fame year he fued out his pardon un¬
der the great feal of England. The plague raging in
London, he removed with his family to his eilate at
Heriham j and in Oflober 1666 was examined before
a committee of the houfe of commons concerning the
"fire of London, which happened in September that
year. After his retirement to Herffiam, he applied
himfelf to the Iludy of phyfic, and, by means of his
friend Mr Affimole, obtained from Aichbifkop Shel¬
don a licenfe for the pra£lice of it. A little before his
death he adopted for his fon, by the name of Merlin
junior, one Henry Coley, a taylor by trade 3 and at
the fame time gave him the impreffion of his almanac!-: j Lily
after it had been printed for 36 years. He died in T
1681 of a dead palfy. Mr Aflimole fet a monument .
over his grave in the church of Walton upon Thames.
His “ Obfervations on the Life and Death of Charles
late King of England,” if we overlook the altrological
nonfenfe, may be read with as much fatisfadlion as
more celebrated hillories 3 Lilly being not only very
well informed, but flridlly impartial. This work, with
the Lives of Lilly and Afhmole, written by them-
felves, were publiffied in one vol. 8vo, in 1774, by Mr
Burman. -

LILYByEUM, in Ancient Geography, a city of Si¬
cily, fituated on the molt welterly promontory of the
ifland of Sicily, and faid to have been founded by the
Carthaginians on their expulfion from Motya by Diony-
fius tyrant of Syracufe. It is remarkable for three
fieges it fubfla'ned ; one againfl Dionyfius the tyrant,
another againfl Pyrrhus king of Epirus, and the third
againft the Romans. The two firft failed in their at¬
tempts, but the Romans with great difficulty made
themfelves mailers of it. No remains of this once Ilate-
Iv city are now to be feen, except fome aqueducts and
temples 3 though it was Handing in Strabo’s time.
LILYE, William, the grammarian, was born in
the year 1466 at Oldham in Hampffiire 5 and in i486
was admitted a femi-commoner of Magdalen college
in Oxford. Having taken the degree of bachelor of
arts, he left the univerfity, and travelled to Jerufalem.
Returning from thence, he continued five years in the
ifland of Rhodes, where he Iludied the Greek language,
feveral learned men having retired thither after the ta¬
king of Conllantinople. From Rhodes he travelled to
Rome 3 where he improved himfelf/in the Greek and
Latin languages, under Sulpitius and P. Sabinus. He
then returned to London, where for fome time he-
taught a private grammar-fehool, being the firlt per¬
fon who taught Greek in the metropolis. In 1510,
when Dr Colet founded St Paul’s fchool, Lilye was ap¬
pointed the firlt mailer 3 at which time, it feems, he was
married and had many children. In this employment
he had laboured 12 years, when, being feized by the
plague, which then raged in London, he died in Fe¬
bruary 1523, and was buried in the north yard of St
Paul’s. He had the character of an excellent gram¬
marian, and a fuccefsful teacher of the learned lan¬
guages. His principal work is BreviJJima inJUtutio,
feu ratio grammatices cognofcenduc ; Lond. 1513. Re¬
printed times without number, and commonly called
Lilye's grammar. The Engliffi rudiments were writ¬
ten by Dr Colet, dean of St Paul’s j and the preface
to the firft edition, by Cardinal Wolfey. The Englifh
fyntax was written by Lilyealfo the rules for the
genders of nouns, beginning with propria qiue mari~
bus: and' thofe for the preterperfedl tenfes and fupines,
beginning with As in prefenti. The Latin fyntax was
chiefly the work of Erafmus. See Ward?s-preface to
his edition of Lilye’s Grammar, 173^..
LIMA, the metropolis of Peru, contains 209>fquares
of buildings, which comprile 8222 doors of dwelling
houfes and (hops, and iffiefe are branched oot into 355
ffreets. In order to maintain peace and tranquillity among
th%-
L I M [ 24 ] L I M
the inhabitants, and for the accommodation of the po¬
lice, the city is divided into four quarters, containing
35 diftri&s, over each of which there prefides an alcaid,
who is always elected from among the people of the
molt diftinguiihed rank. The population, according to
eltimates made at different periods, is as follows.
In 1600,
1614,
1700,
1746,
*755,
1781,
1790,
14,262
25,455
37,259
60,000
54,000
60,000
52,627
By this table it appears, that from 1746 to 1755, the
population fullered a diminution of 6oco, which was
owing to an earthquake that happened at the former
period ;—a calamity with w'hich that city is often vi-
fited. Were it not for this circumllance, Lima would
be a perfect paradife, as the adjacent country abounds
with corn, wine, oil, fugar, fruits and flax. Such
abundance of wealth do the inhabitants enjoy, that
when the duke of Palata was lent from Spain as vice¬
roy to Peru, they paved the ftreets through which he
was to pafs with ingots of fllver. Libertinifm and de¬
bauchery are the diftinguilhing chara&eriftics of the
people of Lima, for which even the nuns are as notori¬
ous as the reft of the females, feldom being free from
•venereal complaints.
In the month of March 1543, the emperor Charles V.
eftablilhed an audience at Lima, in confequence of which
the inhabitants w^ere freed from the painful neceflity of
feeking a redrefs of their grievances at fo great a di-
ftance as Panama. Among the excellent inftitutions
by which the Peruvian capital is diftinguiihed we may
rank the provincial councils, which Ihew the conftant
zeal of the fovereigns of Spain for the defence of reli¬
gion and prefervation of dilcipline. The prelates, by
their paftoral vigilance, fpare neither pains nor labour
to promote their views, to accomplilh their facred and
interefting purpofes.
By a decree of the Spajiilh emperor, which reached
Lima in 1553, a univerfity was begun in a central fpot
of the capital, called the univerfity of St Mark, which
is now in a moft flouriftfing condition. Don Francifco
Toledo afligned 20,3 1 2 piaftres as a fund for the main¬
tenance of the profeffors, ariiing from the tributes paid
by the Indians. Two leisures are given daily on
grammar, one on the Indian language, three on philo-
fophy, three on theology, three on law, two on canons,
and twro on medicine. In the year 1790 an amphi¬
theatre was ere&ed for the ufe of the anatomical ftu-
dents.
The college for female orphans wras founded by
Mateo Paftor De Velafco, not at the hour of death,
which often gives to charitable endowments an air of
fufpicion, but when he was in the full polleflion of per¬
fect health. In 1597 a pious philofopher founded a
charitable inftitution for the fupport of fuch helplefs
children as were laid down in the ftreets by their un¬
feeling parts. This building was deftroyed by the
earthquake of 1687, which laid in ruins the greater
part of the city. It was afterwards rebuilt and is at
prefent in a flouriftiing condition. In 1559 an hofpital
was ere&ed for the relief of the unfortunate fick, who
2
might otherwife have periihed for want of medical aid, Limaflbl.
and obtained the name of the felloxvjkip of Charity and —v 
ConipaJJion. A general hofpital lor the poor was be¬
gun about 1758, but not completed till 1770, which
in 1790 afforded a comfortable afylum to 29 poor
people. The afylum for penitent females was founded
in 1669. has been laid that there is not a city in
the world in which fo many alms are diftributed as in
Lima.
In the centre of the great fquare there is a fountain
of bronze, the ornaments of which are conformable to
the rules of the compofite order. It has an elevation
1 5t yards to the helmet of Fame, from which de¬
ducing 14 yards for the height of that figure, the re¬
mainder gives the part to which the water rifes in
order to diftufe itfelf. This produdlicn of art, combin-
ing magificence in every part of it with fine architec¬
tural tafte, is furrounded by 24 pieces of artillery, and
16 iron chains, a narrow fpace being left for accefs to
the inhabitants.
Coffee-houles were not known in Lima till the year
1771, when one was opened in the ftreet of Santo Do-
mingo, and another the year following. A third was
eftablilhed in 1775, a fourth in 1782, and a fifth in
1788, in each of which there is a billiard table for the
amufement of the inhabitants. We are forry to fay
that the barbarous pradlice of cock-fighting obtains in
Lima, for which purpole a building was ereCed in
the year 1762. The tennis court isopen to the public,
and affords the fpedfator an agreeable hour of relaxa¬
tion from more ferious purfuits. Lima is fituated in W.

LIMASSOL, or Limisso, a town of Cyprus, in MaritVs
the fouth of the illand. Of the ancient city nothing TVrtw/j
but ruins now remains j though it was a celebrated
place, even under the government of the dukes. King ^yPruM
Richard, the conqueror of the laft of thefe vaffals of the
empire, razed it in 1191, and it was never afterwards
rebuilt. This city originally was the fame as Ama-
thus, or Amathonte4 fo famous, as Paufanias tells us,
for its temple ereCed in honour of Venus and Adonis.
Amathus was the refidence of the nine firft kings of
the illand j and, among!! others of Oneliftus, who was
fubje&ed afterwards by the arms of Artabanes, the
Perfian general. This city, eredled into an archbifliop-
ric in the time of the Chriftians, has produced a number
of perfonages celebrated for their knowledge and the
fan&ity of their lives. In the neighbourhood there are
feveral copper mines, which the Turks have been forced
to abandon. The following lines, in the tenth book
of Ovid’s Metamorphofes, prove that they were known
in the time of that poet :
Capta viri forma, non jam Cytherea curat
Littora, non alto repetit Paphon ccquore cinBam,
Pifcofamque Gnidon, gravidamque Amathunta metallis.
The place where the new Limaffol now Hands former¬
ly had the name of Nemojia, from the multitude of
woods by which it was furrounded. Richard king of
England having deftroyed Amathonte, Guy de Lu-
fignan, in the ’. 2th century, laid the foundation of that
new city which the Greeks called Neopolcos. The fa¬
mily of Lufignan, who continued to embellifti and for¬
tify it, built there palaces, and Greek and Latin
churches } and made it the feat of a bilhop. When
the
L I M [ 25 ] L I M
Limax tlie illand was taken by tlie Turks in 1570, the Ot-
II toman army entered this city on the 2d of July, and
Limbat. ravagec[ without mercy. It was then deftroyed by
the dames : and at prefent it is only a wretched place,
in which one can fcarcely diftinguith any remains of its
ancient editices. It is governed by a commiflary and
a cadi: the latter judges cafes only provilionally, before
they are carried to the fuperior tribunal of Nicofia.
The harbour is very commodious j and being (heltered
from impetuous wands, it affords a fafe and calm afy-
lum to veffels wdien overtaken by a ftorm. The carob
tree is here more abundant than anyw’here elfe j and
it is from the port of Limalfol that the greateft quan¬
tity of its fruit is exported. The inhabitants export
alfo fait, procured from a lake near Salines. Cotton,
wheat, barley, and mulberry trees, are both plentiful
and wrell cultivated in this part of the ifland : the
ground alfo produces ail kinds of garden duff. The
bed Cyprus wine is made from the vines that grow on
the hills of Limaffal. All the wines of the country
are collefted in this city to be tranfported to Larnic,
where there are the larged cellars, and which on that
account becomes the natural centre of commerce.

faid to be the place where the patriarchs waited the
redemption of mankind : in this place they fuppofe
our Saviour’s foul continued from the time of his death
to his refur region. 2. The limb of infants dying
without baptifm, is a place fuppofed to be didinCf
both from heaven and hell ; fince, fay they, children
dying innocent of any a&ual fin, do not deferve hell;
and, by reafon of their original fin, cannot be admitted
into heaven.
LIMBAT, the name of a periodical wind common
in the ifland of Cyprus, and of great fervice in mode¬
rating the heats of the climate, which would otherwife
be intolerable.
According to the abbd Mariti, it begins to blow
at eight in the morning the firft day increafes as the
fun advances till noon j then gradually weakens, and
at three falls entirely. On the fecond day it arifes at
the fame hour; but it does not attain its greateft
ffrength till about one in the afternoon, and ceafes at
four precifely. On the third day it begins as before ;
but it falls an hour later. On the five fucceeding
days, it follows the fame progreffion as on the third ;
but it is remarked, that a little before it ceafes, it be-
cismes extremely violent. At the expiration of five
days it commences a new period like the former. By
narrowly obferving the fea on that fide from w’hich
it is about to blow, a little before it arifes, one may
determine what degree of ftrength it will have during
the day. If the horizon is clear, and entirely iree
from clouds, the wind will be weak, and even almoft
infenfible ; but if it is dark and cloudy, the wind will
be flrong and violent. This limbat wind, notwith-

Handing its utility in moderating the exceflive heat, of- Limborch,

from their being lefs habituated to the climate, and
moie apt than the natives to fuffer thernfelves to be fur-
prifed by the cool air when in a ftate of perfpiration.
This wind, the falling of which happens an hour iboner
or later, is fucceeded by a calm, accompanied by a
certain moifture that renders the air fomewhat heavy.
This moilture difappears in the evening, being diflipa-
ted by a wind which arifes every day at that period.
This wind is confidered as a land breeze by the inha¬
bitants of the fouthern and eafiern parts of the illand ;
but it is called a fea breeze by thole in the northern and
wreftern, who indeed receive it immediately from the
fea. In fummer it blows till four o’clock in the morn¬
ing, and when it ceafes, it leaves a profound calm,
w'hich continues till the hour wdien the limbat com¬
mences. In autumn and winter it never falls till day¬
break, when it is fucceeded by other winds, which
proceed from the irregularity of the feafon. In fpring
it does not continue longer than midnight; and is then
fucceeded by that happy calm, during which thofe re-
frething dews are formed that moiften the earth at fun-
riling. The limbat winds, which arife in the beginning
of fummer, ceafe about the middle of September ; and
this is the period when the moll infupportable heats
commence, becaufe their violence is not moderated by
the fmalleli breeze. They are however, luckily not of
long duration ; and about the latter end of Oftober
they decreafe fenfibly, as the atmolphere begins to be
loaded with watery clouds.
LIMBORCH, Philip, a learned writer among the
remonllrants, born at Amllerdam in 1633. After ha¬
ving made great proficiency in his lluclies, he wras, in
1655, admitted to preach in public, which he did firll
at Haerlem. His fermonshad in them no affedled elo¬
quence ; but were folid, methodical, and edifying. He
was chofen minilter of Goudja ; from whenpe he was
called to Amllerdam, where he had the profefforlhip
of divinity, in which he acquitted himfelf with great
reputation till his death, which happened in 1712.
He had an admirable genius, and a tenacious memory.
He had many friends of dillinftion in foreign parts as
well as in bis own country. Some of his letters to Mr
Locke are printed wdth thofe of that celebrated author.
He had all the qualifications fuitable to the character
of a fincere divine, lived an example of every virtue,
and preferved the vigour of his body and mind to a
confiderable age. He wrote many ivorks, which are
elleemed ; the principal of which are, 1. Arnica col-
latio de veritate religionis ChriJIiance cum erudito Judao,
in 1 2mo. 2. A Complete Body of Divinity, accord¬

LIMERICK, a county of Ireland, in the province
of Munfter, is bounded on the eaft by Tipperary, on
the weft by Kerry, on the north by the river Shan¬
non, and on the South by Cork. It is a fruitful and
populous traff, the foil requiring little or no manure
in moft places: beftdes rich pafture for flieep and cows,
it produces rich crops of all kinds of corn and rape,
with Some hemp. It gave title of earl to the family of
Donegal. It contains 375,320 Iriih plantation acres,
about 56 church livings, though a much greater num¬
ber of pariihes, 10 baronies, three boroughs; and
formerly Sent eight members to parliament. It has
Some clays, furze, fern, and mountain lands, and is
famous for good cyder; it has been much benefited
by the Palatines, who Settled there and increafed til¬
lage ; they are a laborious independent people, moftly
employed in their own farms. This county is well
watered by large and Small rivers; the Shannon runs at
the north fide of the county, and fertilizes its banks.
The firing of the inhabitants is chiefly turf, and the
bogs are conveniently fituated. At Loghill in the
weft of the county, there is a mine of coal or culm,
but it is more ufed in kilns than in houfes. There are
few lakes except Lough Gur ; and the principal hills
are Knockgreny, Knockany, Knokfiring and Tory-
hill. The mountains lie weftward, the higheft being
Knockpatrick or St Patrick’s hill. This county is
about 45 miles long and 42 broad.
Limerick, or Lough-Meath, a market town, a bo¬
rough, and a bifhop’s fee, now the metropolis of the
province of Munfter. It is Situated on the river Shan¬
non, 94 miles from Dublin ; and was the ftrongeft
fortrels in the kingdom. Its ancient name was Lun-
neach; and during the firft ages it was much frequented
by foreign merchants, and after the arrival ‘of the
Danes was a place of confiderable commerce until the
1 2th century. It was plundered by Mahon, brother
of Brien Boromh, after the battle of Sulchoid, in 970 ;
and Brien, in a future period, exafted from the Danes
of this city 365 tons of wine as a tribute, which Ihows
the extenfive traflic carried on by thofe people in that
article. About the middle of the 6th century, St
Munchin erecled a church and founded a biihopric
here ; which, however, was deftroyed by the Danes on
their taking pofleffion of this port in 853, and remained
in ruins until their converfion to the Chriftian faith in
the 10th century ; at which period the church of St
Munchin was rebuilt, and the bifhopric eftablilhed.
Donald O’Brien, about the time of tire arrival of the Limerick*
Englfth, founded and endowed the cathedral ; and Do- v
nat O’Brien, bilhop of Limerick, in the 13th century,
contributed much to the opulence of the lee. About
the clofe of the 1 2th century, the biftiopric of Innis-Ca-
thay was united to that of Limerick. It was befieged
by King William III. in the year 1690, and though
there was no army to aflift it, the king was obliged to
raife the fiege. In the year 1691, it w'as again belieged
by the Englilh and Dutch on the 21ft of September ;
and it was obliged to furrender on the 13th of Odlober
following, not without the lofs of abundance of men;
however, the garrifon had very honourable and advan¬
tageous conditions, being permitted to retire where
they thought fit, and the Roman catholics by thefe ar¬
ticles were to be tolerated in the free exercife of their
religion. Within a century this place was reckoned
the fecond city in Ireland ; at prelent it has loft its
rank ; not becaufe it thrives lefs, but becaufe Cork
thrives more. It is compofed of the Irifli and Englilh
town ; the latter Hands on the King’s ifland, formed
by the river Shannon. The town is three miles in
circumference, having weekly markets on Wednefday
and Saturday, and fairs on Eafter Tuefday, ift July,
4th Auguft, and 12th December. There is a privi¬
lege annexed to the fair held on 4th Auguft, that, dur¬
ing 15 days, no perfon can be arrefted in the city or
liberties, on any procefs ifiuing cut of the thollel
court of Limerick. Ardfert and Achadoe, in the
county of Kerry, are united to the biihopric of Li-
meric. This city formerly returned two members to
parliament; and gives title of vifcount to the family of
Hamilton. It is governed by a mayor, ftrerifts, recorder,
aldermen, and burgefles ; there is alfo a barrack and
a military governor and town major : it had feme time
the privilege of coinage; and different parliaments
have been held there. The towm was formerly entire¬
ly walled in ; and in 1760, there were 17 of the city
gates Handing ; but to the great improvement of the
place they are now all demolilhed, except the ivater-
gate of King John’s caflle. The linen, woollen, and
paper manufactures, are carried on here to great extent,
and the export of provifions is very confiderable. Here
are many charitable hofpitals, and handfome public
buildings, befides the cathedral and other churches. A
charter was granted to this city by King John, and
confirmed in fucceeding reigns. Dr Campbell ob-
ferves, that as you approach Limerick, the grounds
grow’ rich and exquifitely beautiful ; the only dif-
agreeable matter is, that the fituation renders the air
moift, and confequently rather unwholefome to ftran-
gers. About fix miles from this is the famous Caitle-
connel fpa. Limerick is 50 miles from Cork, 50
from Galw’ay, and 73 from Waterford. It appears
that Limerick obtained the privilege of having inayors
10 years before that right was allowed to the citizens
of London. It was before governed by provoHs, of
which the firft was John Spafford in 1195 and 1197 ;
during the provoftfliip of Henry Troy a charter was
granted, 9 Richard I. whereby the citizens were allow¬
ed to choofe mayors and kailiffs, Adam Servant, in
1198, being the firft mayor. It continued to be go¬
verned by mayors and bailiffs, until the office of bailiff
was changed into that of Iheriff in 1629.

LIMIT, in a reftrained fenfe, is ufed by mathema¬
ticians for a determined quantity to which a variable
one continually approaches 5 in which fenfe, the circle
may be faid to be the limit of its circumfcribed and
infcribed polygons. In Algebra, the term limit is ap¬
plied to two quantities, one of which is greater and
the other lefs than another quantity ; and in this fenfe
it is ufed in fpeaking of the limits of equations, whereby
their folution is much facilitated.
LIMITED PROBLEM, denotes a problem that has
but one folution, or fome determinate number of folu-
tions; as to defcribe a circle through three given points

LIMNING, the art of painting in water colours,
in contradiflindlion to painting wffiich is done in oil-
colours.
Limning is much the more ancient kind of paint¬
ing. Till a Flemiffi painter, one John van Eyck, bet¬
ter known by the name of 'John of Bruges, found out
the art of painting in oil, the painters all painted in
water and in frefco, both on their walls, on wooden
boards, and elfewhere. When they made ufe of
boards, they ufually glued a fine linen cloth over them,
to prevent their opening j then laid on a ground of
white ; laftly, they mixed up their colours with water
and fize, or with water and yolks of eggs, well beaten
with the branches of a fig tree, the juice whereof thus
mixed with the eggs j and with this mixture they paint¬
ed their pieces.
In limning, all colours are proper enough, except
the wffiite made of lime, which is only tiled in frefco.
The azure and ultramarine mult always be mixed with
fize or gum ; but there are always applied two layers
of hot fize before the fize colours are laid on : the co¬
lours are all ground in water each by itfelf j and, as
they are required in working, are diluted with fize wa¬
ter. When the piece is finilhed, they go over it with

place where the pidture is to be. The ground being
laid, and the party placed in a due pofition, begin the
work, which is to be done at three fittings. At the
firlt you are only to dead-colour the face, which will
require about two hours. At the fecond fitting, go
over the work more curioully, adding its particular
graces or deformities. At the third fitting, finifli the

LINACRE, Thomas, phyfician, was born at Can¬
terbury about the year 1460, and there educated under
the learned William Selling : thence he removed to
Oxford, and in 1484 was chofen fellow of All-Soul’s
college. Tilly, alias Selling, his former inftruftor,
being at this time appointed ambaffador from King
Henry VII. to the.court of Rome, Mr Linacre accom¬
panied him to Italy, where he attained the higheft de¬
gree of perfeflion in the Greek and Latin languages.
At Rome, he applied himfdf particularly to the ftudy
of Ariftotle and Galen, in the original. On his return
to Oxford, he was incorporated doflor of phyfic, and
chofen public profeffor in that faculty. But he had not
been long in England, before he was commanded to
court by King Henry Vil. to attend the young prince
Arthur as his tutor and phyfician. He was afterwards
appointed phyfician to the king, and after his dea'h, to
his fucceffor Henry VIII. Dr Linacre founded two
medical leflures at Oxford, and one at Cambridge*, but
that which moft effeflually immortalized his name a-
mong the faculty, is his being the firft founder of the
college of phyficians in London. He beheld with vexa-

tion the wretched date of phyfic in thofe times ; and
by an application to Cardinal Wolfey, obtained a pa¬
tent in 1518, by which the phyficians of London were
incorporated. The intention of this corporation was to
prevent illiterate and ignorant medicarters from prac-
tifmg the art of healing. Dr Linacre was the firlt pre-
fident, and held the office as long as he lived. Their
meetings were in his own houfe in Knight-rider flreet,
which houfe he bequeathed to the college. But our
dodor, when he was about the age of 50, took it into
his head to iludy divinity-, entered into orders ; and
was collated, in 1509, to the redory of Merffiam. In
the fame year he was inftalled prebendary of Wells, in
1518 prebendary of York, and in the following year
was admitted precentor of that cathedral. This, we are
told, he refigned for other preferments. He died of
the Hone in the bladder in Oclober 1524, aged 64 ;
and was buried in St Paul’s. Thirty-three years after
his death, Doctor John Caius caufed a monument to
be ere&ed to his memory, with a Latin infeription,
which contains the outlines of his life and charader.
He was a man of great natural fagacity, a Ikilful phy-
fician, a profound grammarian, and one of the belt
Greek and Latin fcholars of his time. Erafmus in
his e pi Hies fpeaks highly of the Dodor’s tranflations
from Galen, preferring them even to the original
Greek. His works are, 1. De emendata JlruBura La-

LINCOLN, a city of England, and capital of a
county of the fame name, is diftant 132 miles from
London. It Hands on the fide of a hili at the bot¬
tom of which runs the river Witham in three fmall
channels, over which are feveral bridges. The old
Lindum of the Britons, which flood on the top of the
hill, as appears from the veltigeS of a rampart, and
deep ditches flill remaining, was taken and demoliffied
by the Saxons 5 who built a town upon the fouth fide
of the hill down to the river fide, which was feveral
times taken by the Danes, and as often retaken by the
Saxons. In Edward the Confeffor’s time, it appears,
from Doomfday-book, to have been a very confider-
able place and in the time of the Normans, Malmfbury
fays, it was one of the moft populous cities in Eng¬
land. William I. built a caftle upon the fummit of
the hill above the town. The diocefe, though the bi-
fliopric of Ely was taken out of it by Henry II. and
thofe of Peterborough and Oxford by Henry VIII. is
flill vaftly large, containing the counties of Leicefler,
Huntingdon, Bedford, and part of Bucks, making 1 255
parifhes. 1 hough the other churches are mean, the
cathedral or minfler is a moft magnificent piece of Go¬
thic architefture. Here is a prodigious large bell,
called Tom of Lincoln, which is near five ton in weight,
and 23 feet in compafs. The hill on which the church
Bands is fo high, and the church itfelf fo lofty, that
it may be feen 30 miles to the north and 30 to the
fouth. Befides other tombs, it contains one of brafs,

in which are the entrails of Queen Eleanor, wife to Lincoln.
Edward I. It is faid there were anciently 32 churches, —-v—
which are now reduced to 14. Such is the magnifi-
cence and elevation of the cathedral, that the monks
thought the fight of it muft be very mortifying to the
devil ; whence it came to be laid of one who was dif-
plealed, that he holed like the devil over Lincoln. The
declivity on which the city is built being fteep,
the communication betwixt the upper and lower town
is very troublefome, and coaches and horfes are obli¬
ged to make a compafs.
King Edward HI. made this city a ftaple for wool,
leather, lead, &c. It was once burnt; once befieged
by King Stephen, who was here defeated and taken
pnfoner ; and once taken by Henry III. from his re¬
bellious barons. It abounded heretofore with mona-
heries and other religious houfes. There is a great
pool here, formed by the river on the weft fide of it,
called Swan Pool, becaufe of the multitude of fwans
on it. The Roman north gate ftill remains entire, by
the name of Newport Gate. It is one of the nobleft:
of this fort in Britain. It is a vaft femicircle of ftones
of very large dimenfions laid without mortar, conneft-
ed only by their uniform fhape. This magnificent arch
is 16 feet in diameter, the fttmes are four feet thick at
the bottom. It feems to have a joint in the middle
not a keyftone : and on both fides, towards the upper
part, are laid horizontal ftones of great dimenfions
fome 10 or 12 feet long. This arch rifes from an im¬
port of large mouldings, which are not perceivable
now; there are alfo divers fragments of the old Roman
wall. Over againft the caftle is an entrenchment caft
up by King Stephen ; and here are carved the arms of
John of Gaunt duke of Lancafter, who lived here like
a king, and had a mint, hhe city has a communica¬
tion with the Trent, by a canal called the Fofs-dyke.
In the centre of the old ruined caftle there is a hand-
fome modern ftrufture for holding the affizes. Its
walls are almoft entire, and very fubftantial : the keep
or principal tower is fituated on a high and very fteep
mount, which yet continues in its original ftate, but the
remains of the tow^er on it are only five or fix yards
high. The outer walls of the caftle are of very con-
fiderable height, which appear ftill higher than they
really are from their lofty fituation and the moat below
them. The great gateway is ftill entire. This city
is a county of itfelf, and has a vifeountial jurifdiaion,
for 20 miles round, which is a privilege that no other
city in England can equal. It now' confifts principal¬
ly of one ftreet above two miles long, well paved, be¬
fides feveral crois and parallel ftreets well peopled.
Here are fome very handfome modern buildings, but
more antique ones j upon the whole, it has an air of
ancient greatnefs, arifing in a great meafure from the
number of raonaftic remains, moft of which are nowr
converted into ftables, out-houfes, &c. Upon the hill,
in the caftle, are the ruins of the bithop’s palace, and
other ruins of ancient grandeur and magnificence.
The city is fupplied with water by feveral conduits,
among w’hich is a modern one, fomewhat in the pyra-
midical ftyle, enriched with fculpture. It is governed
by a mayor, twelve aldermen, two flieriffs, a recorder,
four chamberlains, a fwordbearer, four coroners, and
above forty common-council men. Here are four cha¬

, Sir David, a celebrated Scots poet,
was defcended of an ancient family, and born in the
reign of King James IV. at his father’s feat, called the
5/////“, near Cupar, in Fifefhire. He was educated
at the univerfity of St Andrew’s ; and, after making
the tour of Europe, returned to Scotland in the year
1514. Soon after his arrival, he was appointed gen¬
tleman of the bedchamber to the king, and tutor to
the young prince, afterwards James V. From the
verfes prefixed to his dream, we learn that he enjoyed
feveral other honourable employments at court : but,
in H33> he was deprived of all his places, except that
of Lion king at arms, which he held to the time of
his death. His difgrace was moft probably owing to Lindfey,
his inveftives againft the clergy, which are frequent in Gneus.
all his waitings. After the deceafe of King James V. ' ~ v
Sir David became a favourite of the earl of Arran, re¬
gent of Scotland ; but the abbot of Paifley did not
fuffer him to continue long in favour with the earl.
He then retired to his paternal eftate, and fpent the
remainder of his days in rural tranquillity. He died in
the year 1553. His poetical talents, confidering the
age in which he wrote, were not contemptible ; but
he treats the Romifh clergy with great feverity, and
writes with fome humour : but, whatever merit might
be formerly attributed to him, he takes fuch licentious
liberties with wmrds, ftretching or carving them for
meafure or rhime, that the Scots have a proverb, when
they hear an unufual expreflion, that, There is nae
Jic a word in a’ Davie Lindfay. Mackenzie tells us,
that his comedies were fo facetious, that they afford¬
ed abundance of mirth. Some fragments of thefe co¬
medies are ftill preferved in manufcript. He is faid
to have alfo written feveral tragedies, and to have firfl
introduced dramatic poetry into Scotland. One of his
comedies was played in 1515. Mackenzie fays, he
underftood nothing of the rules of the theatre. He
was cotemporary with John Heywood, the firfl: Eng-
lifh dramatic poet. His poems are printed in one
fmall volume } and fragments of his plays, in manu¬
fcript, are in Mr William Carmichael’s colle&ion.

the convenience of carriage in thofe parts. It had its
name from Lincoln, tne capital of the county, which
flands in it, and by the Romans called Lindum, by
the Britons Lindcoite, by the Saxons Lindo-col/yne, pro¬
bably from its fituation on a hill, and the lakes or
woods that were anciently thereabouts 3 but the Nor¬
mans called it Nichol. It gives title of earl and mar¬

LINEN, in commerce, a wmll known kind of
cloth, chiefly made of flax.— Linen was not worn by
the Jews, Greeks, or Romans, as any part of their
ordinary drefs. Under-tunics of a finer texture fup-
plied the place of fliirts : Hence the occafion for fre¬
quent bathing. Alexander Severus was the firit em¬
peror who wore a fliirt : but the ufe of fo necef-
fary a garment did not become common till long after
him.
The linen manufaflure was probably introduced into
Britain wdth the firrt fettlements of the Romans. The
flax was certainly firit planted by that nation in the
Britifh foil. The plant itfelf indeed appears to have
been originally a native of the eaft. The woollen-
drapery would naturally be prior in its origin to the
linen 5 and the fibrous plants from wLich the threads of
the latter are produced, feem to have been firft noticed
and worked by the inhabitants of Egypt. In Egypt,
indeed, the linen manufafture appears to have been
very early : for even in Jofeph’s time it had rifen to a
confiderable height. From the Egyptians the knowr-
ledge of it proceeded probably to the Greeks, and
from them to the Romans. Even at this day the
flax is imported among us from the eaftern nations j
the weflern kind being merely a degenerate fpecies
of it.
In order to fucceed in the linen manufacture, one
fet of people fhould be confined to the ploughing and
preparing the foil, fowing and covering the leed, to
the weeding, pulling, rippling, and taking care of
the new feed, and watering and drefling the flax till
it is lodged at home : others fliould be concerned in
the drying, breaking, fcutching, and heckling the flax,
to fit it for the fpinners •, and others in fpinning and
reeling it, to fit it for the weaver : others fliould be
concerned in taking due care of the weaving, bleach¬
ing, beetling, and finifliing the cloth for the market.
It is reafonable to believe, that if thefe feveral branches
of the manufaClure were carried on by diftinCl dealers
in Scotland and Ireland, where our home-made linens
are manufactured, the feveral parts would be better ex¬
ecuted, and the whole wrould be afforded cheaper, and
with greater profit.
Staining of Linen. Linen receives a black colour
with much more difficulty than woollen or cotton. The
black ftruck on linen with common vitriol and galls, or
logwood, is very periffiable, and foon w^aflies out.—In-
ftead of the vitriol, a folution of iron in four ffrong beer
is to be made ufe of. This is well known to all the calico-
printers 5 and by the ufe of this, which they call their
iron-liquor, and madder root, are the blacks and pur¬
ples made which we fee on the common printed linens.
LIN [ 31 ] LIN
Linen The method of making this iron-liquor is as follows :
U A quantity of iron is put into the four ftrong beer*,
Linlithgow. an(^ to proroote the diffolution of the metal, the whole
" v is occalionally well itirred, the liquor occafionally drawn
off, and the ruff beat from the iron, after which the li¬
quor is poured on again. A length of time is required
to make the impregnation perfect *, the folution being
reckoned unfit for ufe till it has flood at leaft a twelve-
month. This folution flains the linen of a yellow, and
different lhades of buff-colour; and is the only known
fubflance by which thefe colours can be fixed on linen.
The cloth ftained deep with the iron-liquor, and after¬
wards boiled with madder, without any other addition,
becomes of the dark colour which we fee on printed
linens and cottons \ which, if not a perfebl black, has
a very near refemblance to it. Others are ftained paler
with the fame liquor diluted with wrater, and come out
purple.
Linen may alfo be ftained of a durable purple by
means of folution of gold in aqua regia. The folution
for this purpofe fhould be as fully laturated as poflible *,
it fhould be diluted with three times its quantity of
water and if the colour is required deep, the piece,
when dry, muft be repeatedly moiftened with it. The
colour does not take place till a conftderable time,
fometimes feveral days, after the liquor has been ap¬
plied : to haften its appearance, the fubjett fhould be
expofed to the fun and free air, and occafionally re¬
moved to a moift place, or moiftened wdth water.—
When folution of gold in aqua regia is foaked up in
linen cloths, the metal may be recovered by drying and
burning them.
Linen flowered with Gold-leaf. Dr Lewis mentions a
manufacture eftabliftied in London for embellifhing
linen with flowers and ornaments of gold-leaf. The
linen, he fays, looks whiter than moft of the printed
linens 5 the gold is extremely beautiful, and bears walk¬
ing well. The doClor informs us, that he had feen a
piece which he was credibly informed had been vvaflied
three or four times, with only the fame precautions
which are ufed for the finer printed linens j and on
which the gold continued entire, and of great beauty.
Concerning the procefs ufed in this manufaClure, he
gives us no particulars.
Fofli/e Linen, is a kind of amianthus, which confifts

LINLITHGOW, the chief town of Weft Lothian
in Scotland. It is fuppofed to be the Lindum of Ptole¬
my t and to take its name from its fituation on a lake,
which the word Lin or Llyn fignifies.—It is diftant 16
miles from. Edinburgh, and is a royal borough and leat
of a prelhytery. Here is carried on a confiderable trade Linlithgow,
in drefiing of white leather, which is fent abroad to be bmluhgow-
manufadured; and many hands are employ ed in drefling ' ,
of flax ; alfo in wool-combing, the wmol for which is
brought from the borders. Its port was formerly Black-
nefls-, but fince the decline of that fl2.cz, Borrowflounnefs,

confifts of one open ftreet, from whence lanas are de¬
tached on both fides; the houfes are built of ftone,
tolerably neat and commodious; and the place is a-
dorned wdth feme ftately public edifices. The palace,
built, as Sibbaid fuppofed, on the leat of a Roman 11a-
tion, forms a fquare with totvers at the corners, and
Hands on a gentle eminence, with the beautiful loch be¬
hind it to the weft. It was one of the nobleft of the roy¬
al refidences; and wTas greatly ornamented by James V.
and VI. Within the palace is a handfome fquare j one
fide of which is more modern than the others, having
been built by James VI. and kept in good repair till
1 746, when it was accidentally damaged by the king’s
forces making fires on the hearths, by which means
the joifts were burnt. A ftone ornamented fountain in
the middle of the court was deftroyed at the fame
time. The other fides of the fquare are more ancient.
In one is a room ninety-five feet long, thirty feet fix
inches wide, and thirty-three high. At one end is a
gallery with three arches, perhaps for mufic. Narrow
galleries run quite round the old part, to preferve com¬
munication wdth the rooms *, in one of which the un¬
fortunate Mary Stuart firft faw light. On the north
fide of the high ftreet, on an eminence call of the pa¬
lace, Hands St Michael’s church ; a handfome ftrufture,
where James V. intended to have eredted a throne and
twelve ftalls for the fovereign and knights of the order
of St Andrew. In the market-place is another foun¬
tain of two ftories with eight fpouts, and furmounted
like the former with an imperial crown. In one of the
ftreets is fhown the gallery where the regent Murray
was fhot. Here was a houfe of Carmelites, founded
by the townfpeople in 1 290, deftroyed by the Reformers
1559. The family of Livingfton, who took the title
of earl from this place, were hereditary keepers of this
palace, as alfo bailiffs of the king’s bailifry, and con-
ftables of Blacknefs caftle 5 but by their concern in the
rebellion of 1715 all thefe honours with their eftate
were forfeited to the crown. Sir James Livingfton, fon
of the firft earl by marriage with a daughter of Callen-
dar, was created earl of Callendar by Charles L.1641,
which title funk into the other.
LINLITHGOWSHIRE, or West Lothian,
nearly approaches in form to a parallelogram, about
20 miles long from eait to weft, and from 10 to 13

Forth on the north *, by the river Amond on the fouth-
eaft $ by Lanarkfliire on the fouth-weft *, and by the
river Avon on tha w’eft. It is allowed to be one of the
richeft counties in Scotland, the foil in general being a
rich loam, in a high ftate of cultivation and improve¬
ment. Its furface is diverfified by gentle fwells and
fertile plains 3 and the number of elegant feats almoit
everywhere to be met with, gives it both a rich and de¬
lightful appearance. The whole is a compofition of

Linlithgow and Queensferry, befides the towns of
Borrowitounnefs, Bathgate, and Kirkliftoun. It is
poorly fupplied with running water, the Avon and
Amond being the only ftreams which are deferving of

in abundance, fuch as coal, limeftone, and fome lead
ore. In the reign of James VI. a vein of lead w as dif-

of being wrought for the fake of that metal alone.
Almoft every parifh abounds with ironftone, which is
extenfively wrought in the parfth of Bathgate. In many
places there are appearances of whinftone or bafalt, par¬
ticularly at Dundas-hill, in the parifh of Dalmeny,
where there is a folid front of bafaltic rock, exhibiting
in fome places regular columns. The population of
this county in 1801 amounted to 17,844. The fol¬
lowing is the population of the parifhes according to the

LINN ALUS, Sir Charles, a celebrated botanift
and natural hiftorian, was born on May 24. 1707, in
a village called Roejhult in Smaland, wrhere his father,
Nicholas Linnaeus, w'as then vicar, but afterwards pre¬
ferred to the curacy of Stenbrohult. We are told, that
on the faim w’here Linnaeus was born, there yet ftands
a large lime tree, from which his anceftors tooL the
furnames of TiHander^ Lindelius, and Lintnvus ; and that
this origin of furnames, taken from natural objecls, is
not uncommon in Swreden.
This eminent man, whofe talents enabled him to re¬
form the whole fcience of natural hiftory, accumulated,
very early in life, fome of the higheft honours that a-
v^ait the moft fuccefsful proficients in medical fcience 5
fmee we find that he was made piofeffor of phyfic and
botany, in the univerfity of Upfal, at the age of 34 5
and fix years afterwards, phyfician to Adolphus king
of Sweden j who in the year 1753 honoured him itill
farther, by creating him knight of the order of the

His honours did not [terminate here : for LlrtiXus,

warded his declining years by doubling his penfion, and Genera/

It feems probable, that Linnaeus’s tafte for the ftu- wfitin8s °f
dy of nature w as caught from the example of his fa- Lmneeus-
ther ; who, as he has himfelf informed us, cultivated, as
his fiift amufement, a garden plentifully ftored with
plants. Young Linnaeus foon became acquainted with
thefe, as well as with the indigenous ones of his neigh¬
bourhood. Yet, from the ftraitnefs of his father’s in¬
come, caw young naturalift was on the point of beino-
deftined to a mechanical employment; fortunately',
however, th;s defign was over-ruled. In 1717 he was
fent to fchool at Wexfio; where, as his opportunities
were enlarged, his progrefs in all his favourite purfuits
w-as proportionably extended. At this early period he
paid attention to other branches of natural hiftory, par¬
ticularly to the knowdedge of infects.
The firft part of his academical education Linnseus
received under Profeflbr Stobaeus, at Lund, in Scania,
who favoured his inclinations to the ftudy of natural
hiftory. After a refidence of about a year, he remov¬
ed in 1728 to Upfal. Here he foon contracted a
clofe friendfhip with Artedi, a native of the province
of Angermania, who had already been four years a Itu-
dent in that univerfity, and, like himfelf, had a ftrong
bent to the ftudy of natural hiftory in general, but par¬
ticularly to ichthyology. Soon after his refidence at
Upfal, our author was alfo happy enough to obtain
the favour of feveral gentlemen of eftabliffied character
in literature. He was in a particular manner encou¬
raged in the purfuit of his fiudies by the patronage of
Dr Olaus Celfius, at that time profeflbr of divinity,
and the reftorer of natural hiftory in Sweden ; who,
being (truck with the diligence of Linnseus in deferib-
ing the plants of die Upfal garden, and his extenfive
knowdedge of their names, not only patronized him in
a general w-ay, but admitted him to his houfe, his ta¬
ble, and his library. Under fuch encouragement it is
not ft range that our author made a rapid progrefs,
both in his ftudies and the efteem of the profelfors:
in faCt, we have a very ftriking proof of his merit and
attainments 5 fince we find, that, after only two years
refidence, he was thought fufficiently qualified to give
leCtures occafionally from the botanic chair, in the
room of Profefibr Rudbeck.
In the year 1731, the R.oyal Academy of Sciences at
Upfal having for fome time meditated the defign of
improving the natural hiftory of Sweden, at the in-
ftance particularly of ProfeflTors Celfius and Rudbeck,
deputed Linnaeus to make the tour of Lapland, wdth
the foie view of exploring the natural hiftory of that
arCtic region ; to which undertaking, his reputation,
already high as a naturalift, and the (Length of his
conftitution, equally recommended him. He left Up¬
fal the 13th of May, and took his route to Gevalia or
Gevels, the principal town of Geftricia, 45 miles di¬
ftant from Upfal. Hence he travelled through Hel-
fingland into Medalpadia, where he made an excur-
fion, and afeended a remarkable mountain before he
reached Hudwickfwald, the chief towm of Helfingland.
From hence he w’ent through Angermaniand to Her-
nofand.

linnEus. nofand, a fea-port on the Bothnia gulf, 76 miles diftant
—-y——1 from Hudwickfwald. When he had proceeded thus
far, he found it proper to retard his journey, as the
fpring was not fufficiently advanced ; and took this
opportunity of vifiting thofe remarkable caverns on
the fummit of Mount Skula, though at the hazard of
his life.
When Linnmus arrived at Uma, in Wert: Both¬
nia, about 96 miles from Hernofand, he quitted the
public road, and took his courfe through the woods
weftward, in order firft to traverfe the moil fouthern
parts of Lapland. Being novr come to the country
that was taore particularly the obje£t of his inquiries,
equally a ftranger to the language and to the manners
of the people, and without any aflbciate, he committed
himfelf to the hofpitality of the inhabitants, and ne¬
ver failed to experience it fully. He fpeaks in feveral
places, with peculiar fatisfaclion, of the innocence and
fimplicity of their lives, and their freedom from difeafes.
In this excurfion he reached the mountains towards
Norway •, and, after encountering great hardrtiips,
returned into Weft Bothnia, quite exhaufted with
fatigue. Our traveller next vifited Pitha and Lula,
upon the gulf of Bothnia ; from which latter place he
took again a weftern route, by proceeding up the ri¬
ver of that name, and vifited the ruins of the temple of
Jockmock in Lula Lapland or Lap Mark : thence he
traverfed what is called the Lapland Defert, deftitute of
all villages, cultivation, roads, or any conveniences j
inhabited only by a few ftraggling people, originally
defcended from the Finlanders, and who fettled in this
country in remote ages, being entirely a diftindl people
from the Laplanders. In this diftridt he afcended a
noted mountain called Wallevari; in fpeaking of which
he has given us a pleafant relation of his finding a An¬
gular and beautiful new plant (Andromeda tetragona')
when travelling within the arflic circle, with the fun
in his view at midnight, in fearch of a Lapland hut.
From hence he crofted the Lapland Alps into Fin-
mark, and traverfed the ftiores of the North fea as far
as Sallero.
Thefe journeys from Lula and Pitha on the Both-
nian gulf, to the north (hore, were made on foot 5 and
our traveller was attended by two Laplanders, one his
interpreter, and the other his guide. He tells us, that
the vigour and ftrength of thefe two men, both old,
and fufficiently loaded with his baggage, excited his
admiration ; fince they appeared quite unhurt by their
labour, while he himlelf, although young and robuft,
was frequently quite exhaufted. In this journey he
was wont to fleep under the boat with which they ford¬
ed the rivers, as a defence againft rain, and the gnats,
which in the Lapland fummer are not lefs teafing than
in the torrid zones. In defcending one of thefe ri¬
vers, he narrowly efcaped periftiing by the overfetting
of the boat, and loft many of the natural produdlions
which he had collefled.
Linnaeus thus fpent the greater part of the fummer
in examining this ardlic region, and thofe mountains
on which, four years afterwards, the French philofo-
phers fecured immortal fame to Sir Ifaac Newton. At
length, arter having fuffered incredible fatigues and
hardfhips, in climbing precipices, parting rivers in mi-
ferable boats, fullering repeated viciflitudes of extreme
heat and cold, and not uufrequently hunger and thirft.

take the fame route from Tornea as when he came
into Lapland, having determined to viftt and examine
the country on the eaftern fide of the Bothnian gulf:
his firft: ftage, therefore, wras to Ula in Eaft Bothnia ;
from thence to Old and New Carlebay, 84 miles iouth
from Ula, He continued his route through Wafa,
Chriftianftadt, and Biorneburgh, to Abo, a Imall uni-
verfity in Finland. Winter was now fetting in apace j
he therefore crofted the gulf by the ifland of Aland,
and arrived at Upfal in November, after having per¬
formed, and that moftly on foot, a journey of ten de¬
grees of latitude in extent, exclufively of thofe devia¬
tions which fuch a defign rendered necefiary.
In 1733 he vifited ai^d examined the feveral mines in
Sweden j and made himfelf fo well acquainted with
mineralogy and the docimaftic art, that we find he was
fufficiently qualified to give leffures on thofe fubjedfs
upon his return to the univerfity. The outlines of his
fyftem on mineralogy appeared in the early editions of
the Syjlema Naturae; but he did not exemplify the w hole
until the year 1768.
In the year 1734 Linnmus was fent by Baron Reu-
terholm, governor of Dalecaria, with feveral other na-
turalifts in that province, to inveftigate the natural pro-
dudlions of that part of the Sw’edilh dominions •, and it
was in this journey that our author firft laid the plan
of an excellent inftitution, which was aftenvards exe¬
cuted, in a certain degree at leaft, by himlelf, with the
afliftance of many of his pupils, and the refult publiffi-
ed under the title of Pan Suecicus, in the fecond volume
of the Amcenitates Academicce.
After the completion of this expedition, it appears
that Linnaeus refided for a time at Fahlun, the princi-^
pal town in Dalecarlia 5 wffiere he tells us, that he
taught mineralogy and the docimaftic art, and prac-
tifed phyfic j and where he w’as very hofpitably treated
by Dr More, the phyfician of the place. It alfo ap- ’
pears, that he contradled at this time an intimacy with
one of that gentleman’s daughters, whom he married
about five years afterwards upon his fettling as a phyfi¬
cian at Stockholm.—In this journey he extended his
travels quite acrofs the Dalecarlian Alps into Norway j
but wre have no particular account of his difcoveries in
that kingdom. In 1735 Linnaeus travelled over many
other parts of Sweden, fome parts of Denmark and
Germany, and fixed in Holland, where he chiefly re¬
fided until his return to Stockholm, about the year
1739. I’1 I735’> ^ie year in which he took the degree
of M. D. he publiffied the firft fketch of his Sujlcma
Nature?, in a very compendious wray, and in the form
of tables only, in 12 pages in folio. By this it appears
that he had at a very early period of his life (certain¬
ly before he was 24 years old), laid the bafis of that
great ftru£lure which he aftenvards railed, not only
to the increafe of his owm fame, but to that of natural
fcience.
In 1736, Linnaeus came into England, and vifited
Dr Dillenius, the . late learned profefibr at Oxford,
whom he juftly confidered as one of the firft botanifts
in Europe. He mentions with particular refpefl the
civilities he received from him, and the privileges
he gave him of infpefting his own and the Sherardian
colle&ions of plants. It is needlefs to fay, that he
vifited Dr Martyn, Mr Rand, and Mr Miller, and

that he was jn a more lingular manner indebted
the friendlhip of Dr Ifaac Lawfon. He alfo con¬
tracted an intimate friendlhip with Mr Peter Collin-
ijn, which was reciprocally increafed by a multitude
of good offices, and continued to the laft without any
diminution. Dr Boerhaave had furnilhed him with
letters to our great naturalift Sir Hans Sloane ; but, it
is with regret that we mull obferve, they did not pro¬
cure him the reception which the warmth of his re¬
commendation feemed to claim.
One of the moll agreeable circumlfances that hap¬
pened to Linnaeus during his refxdence in Holland,
arofe from the patronage of Mr Clifford, in whofe
houfe he lived a conliderable part of his time, being
now as it were the child of fortune :—Exivi patnd
triginta fex nummis aureis dives—are his own words.
With Mr Clifford, however, he enjoyed pleafures and
privileges fcarcely at that time to be met with elfe-
where in the world $ that of a garden excellently llored
with the fineft exotics, and a library furnilhed with
almolt every botanic author of note. How happy he
found liimlelf in this lituation, tbofe only who have
felt tire fame kind of ardour can conceive. Whilit in
Holland, our author was recommended by Boerhaave
io fill the place then vacant, of phyfician to the
Dutch fettlement at Surinam ; but he declined it on
account of his having been educated in fo oppolke a
climate.
Belides beii g favoured with the particular patron¬
age and friendlhip of Boerhaave and Mr Clifford,
as is above mentioned, our author had alfo the plea-
lure of being contemporary with, and of reckoning
among the number qf his friends, many other learned
perfons who have fmce proved ornaments to their pro-
leffion, and whofe merit has moft defervedly raifed
them to fame and honour. Among thefe we may pro¬
perly mention Dr John Burman, prcfeffor of botany
at Amllerdam, whofe name and family are well known
in the republic of letters, and to whom our author dedi-
i ated his Bibliotheca Botanica, having been greatly af-
iifted in compiling that work by the free accefs he
had to that gentleman’s excellent library ; John Fre¬
derick Gronovius of Leyden, editor of Clayton’s F/o-
ra Virgin lea, and who very early adopted Linnaeus’s
lyftem ; Baron Van Swieten, phyfician to the em-
P e^s queen ; Ifaac Lawfon, before mentioned, after¬
wards one of the phyficians to the Britilh army, who
died much regretted at Oofterhout in the year 1747,
and from whom Linnaeus received lingular and very
important civilities j Kramer, fince well known for
an excellent treatife on the docimaftic art ; Van Royen,
botanic profeffor at Leyden j Lieberkun of Berlin,
iamous for his Ikill in microlcopical inllruments and
experiments, ffio thefe may be added alfo the names
of Albinus and Gaubius, and of others, were it re-
quifite to Ihow that our author’s talents had very early
lender him confpicuous, and gained him the regard
of all thofe who cultivated and patronifed any branch
of medical fcience; and to which, doubtlefs, the An¬
gular notice with which Boerhaave honoured him did
i-iot a little contribute.
Early in the year I73^> after Linnaeus had left
Mr Clifford, and, as it Ihould feem, when he refided
with Van Royen, he had a long and dangerous fit of
ficknefs j and upon his recovery went to Paris, where

he was properly entertained by the Juffieus, at that Lmnams.
time the firft botanifts in France. The opportunity —v-—» .
tiffs gave him of infpedling the Herbaria of Royen
and Tournefort, and thofe of the above-named gentle¬
men, afforded him great fatisfafllon. He had in¬
tended to have gone from thence into Germany, to
vifit Ludwig and the celebrated Haller, with whom
he was in clofe correfpond^ence; but he w as not able
to complete this part of his intended route, and was
obliged to return without this gratification.
Our author did not fail to avail himfelf of every
advantage that accd's to the feveral mufeums of this
country afforded him, in every branch cf natural hi-
ftory •, and the number and importance of his publi¬
cations, during his abfence from his native country,
fufficiently demonfirate that fund of knowledge which
he muff have imbibed before, and no lefs tdlify his
extraordinary application. Thefe were Svjlema Na¬
ture?, Fundamenta Botanica, Bibliotheca Botanica, and
Genera Plantarum ; the daft of which is juftly confi-
dered as the moft valuable of all the works of this ce¬
lebrated author. What immenfe application had been
befiowed upon it, the reader may eafily conceive, on
being informed, that before the publication of the firft
edition the author had examined the charadlers of
8cco flowers, ffihe laft book of Linnaeus’s compofi-
tion, publiihed during his flay in Holland, w-as the
Clajfes Plantarum, which is a copious illuftration of the
fecond part of the Fundamenta.
About the latter end of the year 1738, or the be¬
ginning of the next, cur author fettled as a phyfician
at Stockholm j where he feems to have met with con-
fiderable oppofition, and was oppreffed with many
difficulties ; but all of thefe at length he overcame, and
got into extenfive pra&ice 5 and loon after his fettle¬
ment married the lady before fpoken of. By the in-
tereft of Count Teffin, who was afterwards his great
patron, and even procured medals to be ftruck in ho¬
nour of him, he obtained the rank of phyfician to the
fleet, and a ftipend from the citizens for giving lec¬
tures in botany. And what at this time efpecially
was highly favourable to the advancement of his cha-
radler and fame, by giving him an opportunity of dif-
playing his abilities, was the eftablifhment of the
Royal Academy of Sciences at Stockholm •, of which
Linnams was conftituted the firft prefident, and to
which eftabliftiment the king granted leveral privileges,
particularly that of free poftage to all papers direfted
to the fecretary. By the rules of the academy, the
prefident held his place but three months. At the ex¬
piration of that term, Linnatus made his Oratio de sne-
morabilibus in InfeElis, 061. 3. 1739 ; in which he en¬
deavours to excite an attention and inquiry into the
knowledge of infe6ts, by difplaying the many Angular
phenomena that occur in contemplating the nature of
thofe animals’, and by pointing out, in a variety of ia-
ftances, their ufefulnefs to mankind in particular, and
to the economy of nature in general.
During all this time, however, Linnaeus appears to
have had his eye upon the botanic and medical chair
at Upfid, at this time occupied by Rudbeck, who
was far advanced in life. We learn indeed that he
was fo intent on purfuing and perfedling his great de-
figns in the advancement of his favourite ftudy of na-.
ture, that he had determujed, if he failed in procuring
the
LIN [ 35 ]
Linnxus. the profefforftiip at Upfal, to accept the offer that and of varieties
  v-—1 had been made to him by Haller of filling the botanic
chair at Gottingen. However, in courfe of time, he
obtained his wifti. In the year 1741, upon the re-
fignation of Roberg, he was conftituted joint profef-
for of phyfic, and phyfician to the king, with Rofen,
who had been appointed in the preceding year on the
death of Rudbeck. Thefe two colleagues agreed to
divide the medical departments between them ; and
their choice was confirmed by the univerfity. Rofen
took anatomy, phyfiology, pathology, and the the¬
rapeutic part j Linnaeus^ natural hiftory, botany, ma¬
teria medica, the dietetic part, and the diagnofis mor-
borum.
During the interval of his removal from Stock¬
holm to Upfal in confequence of this appointment,
our profeffor was deputed by the Hates of the king¬
dom to make a tour to the iflands of Oeland and Goth¬
land in the Baltic, attended by fix of the pupils, com-
mifiioned to make fuch inquiries as might tend to
improve agriculture and arts in the kingdom, to
which the Swediih nation had for feme time paid a
particular attention. The refult of this journey was
very fuccefsful, and proved fully fatisfactory to the
Hates, and was afterwards communicated to the pub¬
lic. On his return he entered upon the profeffor-
fhip, and pronounced before the univerfity his oration
de Feregrinationum intra Patriam necejfilate, October 17.
1741 ; in which he forcibly dilplays the ufefulnefs of
fuch excurfions, by pointing out to the fludents that
vafi field of obje&s which their country held out to
their cultivation, whether in geography, phyfics, mi¬
neralogy, botany, zoology, or economics, and by ihow-
ing the benefit that mull accrue to themfelves and their
country as rewards to their diligence. That animated
fpirit which runs through the whole of this compofition,
renders it one of the moH pleafing and infirudlive of all
our author’s produ£Hcns.
Linnaeus was now fixed in the fituation that wTas
the befi adapted to his chara&er, his tafte, and abili¬
ties ; and which feems to have been the objeft of his
ambition and centre of his hopes. Soon after his efia-
bliOrment, he laboured to get the academical garden,
which had been founded in 1657, put on a better foot¬
ing and very foon effefted it; procuring alfo a houfe to
be built for the refidence of the profeffor. The whole
had been in ruins ever fince the fire in 1702; and at
the time Linnaeus was appointed profeffor of botany,
the garden did not contain above fifty plants that were
exotic. His correfpondence with the firfl botanifis in
Europe foon fupplied him with great variety. He
received Indian plants from Jufiieu of Paris, and from
Van Royen of Leyden ; European plants from Haller
and Ludwig; American plants from the late Mr Col-
linfon, Mr Catefby, and others j and variety of annuals
from Dillenius: in fiiort, how much the garden owed
to his diligence and care in a few years, may be feen by
the catalogue publilhed under the title of Hortus Upfa-
/ienjis, exhibens Plantas exoticas horto Upfahenjis slca-
demice a ffe (Linrueo) illalas ah anno 1742, in annum

pitus, rariorunique defcripiionibus, in gratiam Jludiofce

this catalogue it appears, that the profeffor had intro¬
duced 1100 fpecies, exclufively of all the Swedifh plants
L I N
which latter, in ordinary gardens, a-
mount not unfrequently to one-third of the whole num¬
ber. The preface contains a curious hiflory of the cli¬
mate at Upfal, and the progrefs of the feafons through¬
out the whole year.
From the time that Linnaeus and Rofen were ap¬
pointed profeffors at Upfal, it Hiould feem that the
credit of that univerfity, as a fchool of phyfic, had
been increafing : numbers of Hudents reforted thither
from Germany, attrafted by the character of thefe two
able men 5 and in Sweden itfelf many young men were
invited to the fludy of phyfic by the excellent manner
in which it was taught, who otherwife would have en¬
gaged in different purfuits.
WhilH Linnaeus was meditating one of his capital
performances, which had long been expedled and great¬
ly wiffied for, he was interrupted by a tedious and
painful fit of the gout, which left him in a very w'eak
and difpirited Hate j and, according to the intelligence
that his friends gave of him, nothing was thought to
have contributed more to the refloration of his fpirits
than the feafonable acquifition, at this juncture, of a
colleflion of rare and undefcribed plants.
The fame which our author had noxv acquired by
his Hysterna Natune, of which a fixth edition, much en¬
larged, had been publifhed at Stockholm in 1748 in
8vo, pp. 232, with eight tables explanatory of the
claffes and orders (and which was alfo republifhed
by Gronovius at Leyden), had brought, as it were, a
conflux of every thing rare and valuable in every branch
of nature, from all parts of the globe, into Sweden.
The king and queen of Sweden had their feparatc col-
leftions of rarities j the former at Ulrickfdahl •, the
latter, very rich in exotic infefts and fliells, procured
at a great expence, at the palace of Drottningholm :
both of which our author was employed in arranging
and defcribing. Befides thefe, the mufeum of the
Royal Academy of Upfal had been augmented by a
confiderable donation from the king, whilff hereditary
prince, in 17465 by another from Count Gyllenborg
the year before 5 by a third from M. Grill, an opulent
citizen of Stockholm.
From this time sve fee the profeffor in a more
elevated rank and fituation in life. His reputation
had already procured him honours from almoH all the
royal focieties in Europe 5 and his own fovereign,
truly fenfible of his merit, and greatly effeeming
his charadler and abilities, favoured him with a mark,
of his diffin£lion and regard, by creating him a
knight of the Polar Star. It was no longer haudatur et
a/get. His emoluments kept pace with his fame and
honours : his pradlice in his profeflion became lucra¬
tive 5 and we find him foon after poffeffed of his coun¬
try houfe and gardens at Hammarby, about five miles
from Upfal. He had moreover received one of the
moff flattering teffimonies of the extent and magnitude
of his fame that perhaps was ever fhown to any lite¬
rary charafter, the Hate of the nation which conferred
it, with all its circumflances, duly confidered. This
was an invitation to Madrid from the king of Spain,
there to prefide as a naturaliH, with the offer of an an¬
nual penfion for life of 2000 piffoles, letters or nobi¬
lity, and the perfeft free exercife of his own religion :
But, after the moff perfetff acknowledgements of
the Angular honour done him, he returned for anfwer,

th-:t If he had any merits, they were due to his own
country.’
In the year 1755, the Royal Academy of Sciences
at Stockholm honoured our profelfor with one of the
firft premiums, agreeably to the will of Count Sparree,
who had decreed two gold medals, of ten ducats value
each, to be annually given by the academy to the au¬
thors of fuch papers, in the preceding year’s Stock¬
holm A61s, as Ihould be adjudged moll ufeful in pro-
moting agriculture particularly, and all branches of ru¬
ral economy. This medal bore on one fide the arms
of the count, with this motto, Superjles m ficientus amor
Frederici Sparree. Linnaeus obtained it in confequence
of a paper De P/antis qius Alpium Suecicarum indigence,
magno rei ceconoinicce et medicce emolumento fieripojfint ;
and the ultimate intention w’as to recommend thefe
plants as adapted to culture in Lapland. This paper
was inferted in the Stockholm A£ls for 1754, vol. xv.
Linnaeus alfo obtained the preemiutn centum aureorum,
propofed by the Imperial Academy of Sciences at Pe-
terfburgh, for the bell paper written to ellablilh or dif-
prove, by new arguments, the dodlrine of the fexes of
plants. It was, il polfible, an additional glory to Lin¬
naeus to have merited this premium from the Peterf-
burgh academy ; inafmuch as a profellbr of that fo-
ciety, a few years before, had with more than common
zeal, although with a futility like that of the other
antagonills of cur author, endeavoured to overturn the
whole Linnaean fyfiem of botany, by attempting to
Ihow that the dodlrine of the fexes of plants had no
foundation in nature, and wras unfupported by fadls
and experiments.
It appears that Linnaeus upon the whole, enjoyed
a good conllitution j but that he w>as fometimes fe-
verely afflidled with a hemicrania, and was not exempt¬
ed from the gout. About the clofe of 1776, he was
fieized with an apoplexy, which left him paralytic 5 and
at the beginning of the year 1777, he fuffered another
llroke, which very much impaired his mental powers.
Put the difeafe fuppofed to have been the more im¬
mediate caufe of his death, was an ulceration of the
urinary bladder ; of which, after a tedious indifpofition,
he died, January 11. 1778, in the 7 ill year of his age,
—His principal other works, befide thofe already men¬
tioned, are, The Iter Qelandicum et Gotlandicum, Iter
Scanicum, Flora Suecica, Fauna Suecica, Materia Me¬
dico, Philofioplua Botamca, Genera Morborum, different
papers in the Ada Upfialienfia, and the Amanitates Aca-
demicce. The lall of this great man’s treatifes was the
MantiJJa Altera, publilhed in 1771 ; but before his
death he had finilhed the greatelt part of the Mandfia
Tertia, afterwards completed and publilhed by his
fon.
To the lovers of fcience it will not appear llrange,
nor will it be unpleafant to hear, that uncommon re-
fpe£l was Ihorvn to the memory of this great man. We
are told, “ that on his death a general mourning took
place at Upfal, and that his funeral procelfion was at¬
tended by the whole univerfity, as well profeffors as
liudents, and the pall fupported by fixteen dodlors of
phyfic, all of whom had been his pupils.” The king
of Sweden, after the death of Linnaeus, ordered a me¬
dal to be ffruck, of which one fide exhibits Linnaeus’s
bull and name, and the other Cybele, in a dejedled at¬
titude, holding in her left hand a key, and furrounded

fame generous monarch not only honoured the Royal
Academy of Sciences with his prefence when Linnteus’s
commemoration was held at Stockholm, but, as a Hill
higher tribute, in his fpeech from the throne to the af-
fembly of the Hates, he lamented Sweden’s lofs by his
death. Nor was Linnaeus honoured only in his own
country. The late wrorthy profeffor of botany at
Edinburgh, Dr Hope, not only pronounced an eulo-
gium in honour of him before his lludents at the open¬
ing of his ledlures in the fpring 1778, but alfo laid
the foundation Hone of a monument (which he after-
ivards eredled) to his memory, in the botanic garden
there ; which, while it perpetuates the name and me¬
rits of Linnaeus, will do honour to the founder, and, it
may be hoped, prove the means of railing an emulation
favourable to that fcience which this illulirious Swede
fo highly dignified and improved.
As to the private and perfonal charadler of this il¬
lulirious philofopher : His llature w?as diminutive and
puny 5 his head large, and its hinder part very high j
his look was ardent, piercing, and apt to daunt the be¬
holder ; his ear not fenfible to mufic j his temper quick,
but eafily appealed.
Nature had, in an eminent manner, been liberal in
tbe endowments of his mind. He feems to have been
poffefled of a lively imagination, corredled however by
a llrong judgement, and guided by the laws of fyltem.
Add to thefe, the moll retentive memory, an unremit¬
ting indullry, and the greatell perfeverance in all his
purfuits } as is evident from that continued vigour with
which he profecuted the defign, that he appears to have
formed lo early in life, of totally reforming and fa¬
bricating anew the whole fcience of natural hiilory j
and this fabric he raifed, and gave to it a degree of
perfection unknown before j and had moreover uie un¬
common felicity of living to fee his own llruClure rife
above all others, notwithllanding every difeourage-
ment its author at firlt laboured under, and the oppoli-
tion it afterwards met with. Neither has any writer
more cautioufly avoided that common error of building
his own fame on the ruin of another man’s. He every¬
where acknowledged the feveral merits of each author’s
fyllem ; and no man appears to have been more fenfible
ol the partial defedls of his own. Thofe anomalies
which had principally been the objedls of criticifm, he
well knew every artificial arrangement mull abound
with j and having laid it down as a firm maxim, that
every fyllem muff finally reft on its intrinfic merit, he
willingly commits his owm to the judgement of pofte-
rity. Perhaps there is no circumftance of Linnmus’s
life which fhows him in a more dignified light than his
conduCl towards his opponents. Difavowing controver-
fy, and juftly confidering it as an unimportant and
fruitlefs facrifice of time, he never replied to any, nu¬
merous as they wTere at one feafon.
To all who fee the aid this extraordinary man has
brought to natural fcience, his talents mull appear in
a very illuftrious point of view 5 but more efpecially to
thofe who, from fimilarity of taftes, are qualified to’ fee
more diftinclly the vaft extent of his original defign,
the greatnefs of his labour, and the elaborate execution
he has given to the whole. He had a happy com¬

nefs, united with that precifion and concifenefs which
fo eminently chara&erize his writings.
The ardour of Linneeus’s inclinations to the fludy of
nature, from his earlieft years, and that uncommon ap¬
plication which he beftowed upon it, gave him a moft
comprehenfive view both of its pleafures and ufefulnefs,
at the fame time that it opened to him a wide field
hitherto but little cultivated, efpecially in his own
country. Hence he was early led to regre-t, that the
fludy of natural hiflory, as a public institution, had
not made its wray into the univerfities ; in many of
which, logical deputations and metaphyfical theories
had too long prevailed, to the exclufion of more ufeful
fcience. Availing himfelf therefore of the advantages
which he derived from a large {hare of eloquence, and
an animated ftyle, he never failed to difplay, in a lively
and convincing manner, the relation this ftudy hath
to the public good •, to incite the great to countenance
and protect it 5 to encourage and allure youth into
its purfuits, by opening its manifold fources of plea-
lure to their view, and fhowing them horv greatly this
agreeable employment rvould add, in a variety of in-
ttances, both to their comfort and emolument. His
extenfive view7 of natural hiltory, as connected with al-
moft all the arts of life, did not allow7 him to confine
thefe motives and incitements to thofe only who were
defigned for the practice of phyfic. He alfo laboured
to infpire the great and opulent wdth a tafte for this
ftudy ; and wfifhed particularly that fuch as w7ere de¬
voted to an ecclefiaftic life Ihould fhare a portion of na¬
tural fcience ; not only as a means of fvveetening their
rural fituation, confined, as many are, perpetually to a
country refidence, but as w7hat would almoft inevitably
lead, in a variety of inftances, to difcoveries which on¬
ly fuch fituations could give rife to, and which the
learned in great cities could have no opportunities to
make. Not to add, that the mutual communication
and enlargement of this kind of knowdedge among
people of equal rank in a country fituation, muft prove
one of the ilrongeft bonds of union and friendihip,
and contribute, in a much higher degree than the ufual
perifhing amufements of the age, to the pleafures and
advantage of fociety.
Linnams lived to enjoy the fruit of his own labour
in an uncommon degree. Natural hiitory raifed it-
felf in Sweden, under his culture to a flate of per*
fedlion unknown elfewhere ; and was from thence dif-
feminated through all Europe. His pupils difperfed
themfelves all over the globe j and, with their mafter’s
fame, extended both fcience and their ow7n. More
than this he lived to fee the fovereigns of Europe
eilablifh feveral public inflitutions in favour of this
ftudy; and even profefforfhips eftablifhed in divers
univerfities for the lame purpofe, w'hich do honour to
their founders and patrons, and which have excited a
curiofity for the fcience, and a fenfe of its worth, that
cannot fail to further its progrefs, and in time raife it
to that rank which it is entitled to hold among the
purfuits of mankind.

Lint, in Surgery, is the fcrapings of fine linen,
ufed by furgeons in dreffing wmunds. It is made into
various forms, which acquire different names accord¬
ing to the difference of the figures.—Lint made up in
an oval or orbicular form is called a pledgit; if in a
cylindrical form, or in ftiape of a date, or olive-ftone,
it is called a dqffil.
Thefe different forms of lint are required for many
purpofes; as, r. To flop blood in frefti wrnunds, by
filling them up with dry lint before the application of
a bandage : though, if fcraped lint be not at hand, a
piece of fine linen may be torn into fmall rags, and ap¬
plied in the fame manner. In very large haemorrhages
the lint or rags fliould be firil dipped in fome flyptic
liquor, as alcohol, or oil of turpentine ; or fprinkled
w7ith fome ftyptic powTder. 2. To agglutinate or heal
wmunds \ to which end lint is very ferviceable, if fpread
with fome digeftive ointment, balfam, or vulnerary
liquor. 3. In drying up wmunds and ulcers, and for¬
warding the formation of a cicatrix. 4. In keeping
the lips of wmunds at a proper difiance, that they
may not hattily unite before the bottom is well di-
gefted and healed. 5. They are highly neceflary to
preferve wounds from the injuries of the air.—Bur¬
geons of former ages formed compreffes of fponge,
wmol, feathers, or cotton ; linen being fcarce : but
lint is far preferable to all thefe, and is at prefent uni-
verfally ufed.
LINTERNUM, or Literum, in Ancient Geogra¬
phy, a city of Campania, fituated at the mouth of the
Clanius, which is alfo called Liturnus, between Cumae
and Vulturnum. It received a Roman colony at the
fame time with Puteoli and Vulturnum •, was improved
and enlarged by Auguftus •, afterwards forfeited its
right of colonyfiiip, and became a prefedture. Hither
Scipio Africanus the Elder retired from the mean envy
of his ungrateful countrymen ; and here he died, and
was buried t though this laft is uncertain, he having a

LINUS, in claflical hiftory, a native of Colchis,
cotemporary with Orpheus, and one of the moil an¬
cient poets .and muficians of Greece. It is impoflible,
at this didance of time, to difcover whether Linus
was the difciple of Orpheus, or Orpheus of Linus.
The majority, however, feem to decide this queftion
in favour of Linus. According to Archbiihop Uiher,
he dourifhed about 1280 B. C. and he is mentioned by
.Eufebius among the poets who wrote before the time
of Mofes. Diodorus Siculus tells us, from Dionyfius of
Mitylene the hiftorian, who was cotemporary with Ci¬
cero, that Linus was the fird among the Greeks who in¬
vented verfes and mufic, as Cadmus fird taught them
the ufe of letters. The fame writer likewife attributes
to him an account of the exploits of the fird Bac¬
chus, and a treatife upon Greek mythology, written
in Peiafgian charadlers, which were alfo thofe ufed by
Orpheus, and by Pronapides the preceptor of Homer.
Diodorus fays that he added the firing lichanos to the
Mercurian lyre; and afcribes to him the invention of
rhime and melody ; which Suidas, who regards him
as the mod ancient of lyric poets, confirms. Mr
Marpurg tells us, that Linas invented cat-gut drings
for the ufe of the lyre, wrhich, before his time, was
only drung with thongs of leather, or with different
threads of flax drung together. He is faid by many
writers to have had feveral difciples of great renown ;
among whom were Hercules, Thamyris, and, accord¬
ing to fame, Orpheus.—Hercules, fays Diodorus, in
learning from Linus to play upon the lyre, being ex¬
tremely dull and obflinate, provoked his mailer to
flrike him ; which fo enraged the young hero, that,
inftantly feizing the lyre of the mufician, he beat out
his brains with his own indrument.

friends, wdio obferved the genius of the young man, he
was permitted to give himfelf up to the art of painting.
He went to Paris in 1725, and in 1738 accompanied
the marquis de Puifieux to Rome, who wras going am-
baffador to Naples. At Rome he was taken notice of
by the earls of Sandwich and Befborough, then Lord
Duncannon, who engaged Liotard to go with them
on a voyage to Conflantinople. There he became ac¬
quainted with the late Lord Edgecumbc, and Sir Eve-
rard hawkener, our ambaflador, who perfuaded him
to come to England, where he flaid two years. In
his journey to the Levant he had adopted the eaflern
habit, and wore it here with a very long beard. It
contributed much to the portraits ot himfelf, and fome
thought to draw cuflomers •, but he was really a paint¬
er of uncommon merit. After his return to the conti¬
nent, he married a young wife, and facrificed his beard
to Hymen. He came again to England in 1772, and
brought a colleflion of pidlures of different makers,
3
which he fold by auclion, and fotne pieces of glafs Lip
painted by himfelf, writh furprifing effecl of light and .11
lhade, but a mere curiofity, as it was neceifary to. Ll^anf
darken the room before they could be feen to advan¬
tage j he affixed, too, as u'ual, extravagant prices to
them. He flaid here about two years, as in his former
journey. He has engraved fome Turkifh portraits,
one of the emprefs queen and the eldefl archduchefs
in Turkifh habits, and the heads of the emperor and
emprefs. He painted admirably well in miniature j
and finely in enamel, though he feldom praflifed it.
But he is beft known by his works in crayons. His
likenclfes were as exadl as poffible, and too like to
pleafe thofe who fat to him ; thus he had great bufi-
nefs the firfl year, and very little the fecond. Devoid
of imagination, and one would think of memory, he
could render nothing but what he faw before his eyes.
Freckles, marks of the fmallpox, every thing found its
place ; not fo much from fidelity, as becaufe he could
not conceive the abfence of any thing that appeared
to him. Truth prevailed in all his works, grace in
very few or none. Nor wras there any eafe in his
outline j but the fliffnefs of a buft in all his por¬
traits. Walpole.

LIPARA, in Ancient Geography, the principal of
the iflands called JEolia, fituated between Sicily and
Italy, with a cognominal town, fo powerful as to have
a fleet, and the other iflands in fubjeftion to it. Ac¬
cording to Diodorus Siculus, it was famous for excel¬
lent harbours and medicinal waters. He informs us
alfo, that it fuddenly emerged from the fea abdtat the
time of Hannibal’s death. The name is Punic, ac¬
cording to Bochart : and given it, becaufe, being a
volcano, it flione in the night. It is now called Li-
pari, and gives name to nine others in its neighbour¬
hood ; viz. Stromboli, Pare, Rotto, Panaria, Saline,
Volcano, Fenicufa, Alicor, and Ulrica. Thefe are
called, in general, the Lipari Ijlands. Some of thefe
are adlive volcanoes at prefent, though Lipari is not.
It is about 15 miles in circumference; and abounds in
corn, figs and grapes, bitumen, fulphur, alum, and
mineral waters.
LIPARI, an ancient and very ffrong town, and
capital of an ifland of the fame name in the Medi¬

habitants into flavery, and demolifhed the place 4 but
it was rebuilt by Charles V. E. Long. 15. 30. N. Lat.

Lipari, properly, is the general name of a duller of
iflands. Thefe, according to Mr Houel, are principally
ten in number, the reft being only uninhabitable rocks
of narrow extent. The largeft and the moil populous
of them, that above mentioned, communicates its name
to the reft. Volcano is a defert but habitable ifland, ly¬
ing fouth from the large ifland of Lipari. Salines,
which lies weft-north-weft from the fame ifland ; Fe-
licudi, nearly in the fame diredlion, but 20 miles farther
diftant ; and Alicudi, IO miles fouth-weft of Felicudi ;
are inhabited. Pannari is eaft of Lipari, the famous
Stromboh north-eaft, and both of them are inhabited.

~”~v—■,""1 was formerly inhabited j Attalo, which might be inha¬
bited •, and DExambianca, on which fome remains of
ancient dwellings are ftill to be found. L'Efcanera is
nothing but a bare rock.
The Fermico/i, a word fignifying arts, are a chain
of fimill black cliffs which run to the north-eaft of
Lipari, till within a little way of Exambianca and Ef-
canera, riling more or lefs above the water, according
as the fea is more or lefs agitated.
Ancient authors are not agreed with refpeift to the
number of the Lipari illands. Few of thofe by whom
they are mentioned appear to have feen them ; and in
places fuch as thefe, where fubterraneous fires burft
open the earth and raife the ocean from its bed, ter¬
rible changes muft fometimes take place. Volcanello
and Volcano were once feparated by a ftrait fo as to
form two iflands. The lava and alhes have filled up
the intervening ftrait; and they are now united into
one illand, and have by this change become much more
habitable.
The cafile of Lip&ri Hands upon a rock on the eaft
quarter of the ifland. The way to it from the city
leads up a gentle declivity. There are feveral roads
to it. This caftle makes a part of the city; and on
the fummit of the rock is the citadel, in which the
governor and the garrifon refide. The cathedral Hands
in the fame fituation. Here the ancients, in con¬
formity to their ufual pratftice, had built the temple
of a tutelary god. This citadel commands the whole
city ; and it is acceffible only at one place. Were an
holtile force to make a defeent on the illand, the inha¬
bitants might retreat hither, and be fecure againft all
but the attacks of famine.
The ancient inhabitants had alfo fortified this place.
Confiderable portions of the ancient walls are ftill
Handing in different places, particularly towards the
fouth : Their ftrudlure is Grecian •, and the Hones are
exceedingly large, and very well cut. The layers are
three feet high, which lhowrs them to have been raifed
in fome very remote period. Thefe remains are fur-
rounded wdth modern buildings. The remains of walls,
which are ftill to be feen here, have belonged not only
to temples, but to all the different forts of buildings
which the ancients ufed to ereft. The vaults, which
are in a better ftate of prefervation than any of the
other parts of thefe monuments, are now converted to
the purpofes of a prifon.
In the city of Lipari there are convents of monks
of two different orders; but there are no convents for
women, that is to lay, no cloifters in which women are
confined ; thofe, however, whofe heads and hearts
move them to embrace a ftate of pious celibacy, are at
liberty to engage in a monaftic life, with the concur-
lence of their confeffors. They put on the facred ha¬
bit, and vow perpetual virginity, but continue to live
with their father and mother, and mix in fociety like
other women. The vow and the habit even enlarge
their liberty. This cuftom wall, no doubt, M. Houel
obferves, appear very ftrange to a French woman ; but
this w7as the wTay in which the virgins of the primitive
church lived. The idea of (hutting them up together
did not occur till the fifth century. The life of thefe
religious ladies is lefs gloomy than that which thofe un¬
der the fame vows lead in other countries. They wear
clothes of particular colours, according as they belong
to this or that order. Their drefs gives them a right to
frequent the churches at any hours \ and the voice of
cenfure, wdiich takes particular pleafure in directing
her attacks againft pious ladies, goes fo far as to afiert,
that fome young women affume the habit with no
other views but that they may enjoy greater free¬
dom.
In this illand oxen of a remarkably beautiful fpecies
are employed in ploughing the ground. The ancient
plough is ftill in uie here. The mode of agriculture
praftifed here is very expeditious. One man traces
a furrowq and another follows to fow in it grain and
pulfe. The ploughman, in cutting the next furrow,
covers up that in which the feed has been fown : and
thus the field is both ploughed and 1'own at once. Na¬
ture feems to be here uncommonly vigorous and fertile.
Vegetation is here more luxuriant, and animals gayer
and more healthful, than almoft anywhere elfe.
Near the city of Lipari, the traveller enters deep
narrow roads, of g very lingular appearance. The
whole ifland is nothing but an affemblage of moun¬
tains, all of them conlifting of alhes or lava difeharged
from the depths of the volcano by which it wTas at
firft produced. The particles of this puzzolana, or
allies, are not very hard ; the adlion of the rain w’ater
has accordingly cut out trenches among the moun¬
tains ; and thefe trenches being perhaps lefs uneven
than the reft of the furface, have of ccnfequence been
ufed as roads by the inhabitants, and have been ren¬
dered much deeper by being worn for fo many ages
by the feet of men and other animals. Thefe roads
are more than five or fix fathoms deep, and not more
than feven or eight feet wide. They are very crooked,
and have echoes in feveral places. You w'ould think
that you were walking through narrow ftreets with¬
out doors or windows. Their depth and windings
Ihelter the traveller from the fun while he is palTing
through them ; and he finds them delicioully cool.
'I he firft volcanic eruption in the Lipan iilands
mentioned in hiftory, is that of w hich Callias takes no¬
tice in his hiftory of the w'ars in Sicily. Callias was
contemporary with Agathocles. That eruption con¬
tinued without interval for feveral days and nights ;
and threw' out great ftones, wEich fell at more than -
a mile’s diftance. The fea boiled all around the illand.
I he works of Callias are loft, and we know not whe¬
ther he defeended to a detail of particulars concerning
the ravages produced by this eruptioa. Under the
confullhip of ^Emilius Lepidus and L. Aurelius O-
reftes, I 26 years before the Chriftian era, thefe illands
were aftefted with a dreadful earthquake. The burn¬
ing of iEtna was the firft caufe of that. Around Lipari
and the adjacent illands, the air was all on fire. Ve¬
getation was withered ; animals died; and fufible bo¬
dies, fuch as w'ax and refin, became liquid. If the inha¬
bitants of Lipari, from whom cur author received thefe
fafts, and the waiters who have handed down an ac¬
count of them, have not exaggerated the truth, we
muft believe that the fea then boiled around the
ifland 5 the earth became fo hot as to burn the cables
by which veffels were fixed to the Ihore, and confumed
the planks, the oars, and even the fmall boats.

lijj'an. tlie time of the war of the allied flates of Italy againft built
Rome. One of the iEolian iflands, fays he, was all
on fire as well as the fea j and that prodigy continued
to appear, till the fenate appealed, by a deputation, the
Wrath of the gods. From the time of that war, which
happened 86 years before the birth of our Saviour,
till the year 144 of our era, we have no account of
any eruption of thefe volcanoes : and from that period
again-, till the year 1444* we hear of no explofion
from them, that is, for the fpace of 1300 years. But,
at that time, both Sicily and the iEolian ifles were agi¬
tated by dreadful fhocks of earthquakes: the volcano
of thefe illes poured forth ftreams of lava with an aw¬
ful violence, and emitted a volume of flame and fmoke
which rofe to an amazing height. After that it dif-
charged enormous ftones which fell at the diftance of
more than fix miles.
A century later, in the year 1550, the fury of
this volcano was again renewed. The allies and Hones
difcharged from the crater filled up the llrait between
Volcano and Volcanello.
About two Centuries after that, in the year 1739,
there was a fixth eruption. The burftings of the vol¬
canic fire were attended with a noife fo dreadful, that
it was heard as far as Melazzo in Sicily.
Father Leandro Alberti fays, that on one of thofe
dreadful occafions, the women of Lipari, after im¬
ploring in vain all the faints, vowed to drink no
more wine if the volcano flioud fpare them. Their
giving up this fmall gratification was doubtlefs of
great fervice 5 yet the eruptions Hill continue, and
have even become more frequent fince that time.
Only 36 years intervened between this eruption and
that wdiich happened in the year 1775. The whole
ifland was then lhaken ; fubterraneous thunder was
heard ; and confiderable ftreams of flame, with fmoke,
ftones, and vitreous lava, iflued from the crater. Li¬
pari was covered over with alhes; and part of thefe
was conveyed by the wfinds all the way into Sicily.
Five years after, however, in the month of April 1780,
there iflued a new explofion from Volcano j the fmoke
was thick, the Ihocks conftant, and the fubterraneous
noife very frequent. So great wTas the confternation
among the inhabitants of Lipari on this occafion, that
the commander Deodati Dolomieu, who vifited thefe
illands not long after that event, informs us, that the
inhabitants in general, but elpecially the wmmen, de¬
voted themfelves as Haves to the fervice of the blefled
virgin ; and wore on their arms, as tokens of their fer-
vitude, fmall iron chains, which they ftill continue to
wear.
1 his a£l: of piety, however, was not fo efficacious
as the deputrytion of the fenate had been. For after
that deputation, more than 200 years paflfed before the
yEolian iiles were affliiled by any other eruption, at
leaft by any confiderable one : Whereas, in three years
after the ladies devoted themfelves in fo fubmiffive a
manner to the fervice of the virgin, the ifles of Li¬
pari were agitated anew' by that fatal earthquake
which ravaged Calabria, and part of Sicilly, on the
5th of February 1783.
The dry baths of St Calogero, in the ifland of Li¬
pari, are ftoves, where fulphureous exhalations, known
to be of a falutary nature, afcend out of the earth
by holes or fpiracles. A range of apartments are
L 1 p
around the place where the exhalations arife.
The heat is communicated through thofe apartments,
in fuch a way, that when entering at one end, you ad¬
vance towards the other, the heat ftill increafes upon
you till you gain the middle apartment, and again di-
miniflies in the fame manner as you proceed from the
middle to the other end of the range of chambers. In
confequence of this difpofition of thefe apartments,
the fick perfon can make choice of that temperature
which beft fuits the nature of his difeafe. There are a
few miferable huts and a fmall chapel for the accommo¬
dation of the people who repair to thefe baths. The
people of the place are ready to attend them. Phyfi-
cians likewife follow their patients thither, when the
difeafe is of fuch a nature as to render their attendance
requifite, and the patient rich enough to afford them
handfome fees : but there is no phyfician fettled in the
place. Befides thefe dry baths, there are baths of hot
w-ater diftinguifhed by the name of St Calogero's baths.
There are around them buildings fufficient to lodge a
confiderable number of fick people with their neceffary
attendants. At prefent, however, thofe buildings are
but in a bad Condition.
The baths confift of two halls*, one fquare, the other
round. The former is antique ; it has been built by
the Romans j it is arched with a cupola, and 12 feet
in diameter j it has been repairer^: The other is like¬
wife arched with a cupola both within and without.
The water comes very hot into the firft. It gufhes
up from among pieces of lava, which compofe a part
of the mountain at the foot of which thefe baths are
built. Thofe ftones remain in their natural ftate. All
that has been done is the railing of a fquare building
enclofing them. Within that building the fick per-
fons either fit down on the ftones, or immerfe them¬
felves in the intervening cavities which are filled with
water. They continue there for a certain time, and
approach nearer to, or remain at a farther diftance
from the fpring, according as their phyfician direfts.
The place ferves alfo as a ftove. The hot vapours
arifing from the water communicate to the furround¬
ing atmofphere a confiderable degree of heat. It is
indeed not inferior to that of the hot baths of Ter¬
mini, which owe their heat -to a fimilar caufe. In
thefe baths, therefore, a perfon can have the benefit
either of bathing in the hot water, or of expofing him-
felf to the vapour, the heat of which is more mode¬
rate. The bath before mentioned, under the appella¬
tion of dry bath, is alfo a ftove *, but the hot vapour
with which it is filled iflues diredtly from the vol¬
cano. The place of the bath is, however, at fuch a
diftance from the volcanic focus, that the heat is not
at all intolerable.
The mountain at the foot of which thefe baths are
fituated is round, and terminates at the fummit in a
rock of petrified afhes, which are very hard and of a
very fine grain. This petrification confifts of pretty
regular ftrata, and appears to have been greatly prior
in its origin to the adjacent rocks; which confift like¬
wife of aibes, but affies that have been depofited at a
much later period. From this rock there proceeds
likewife a ftream of hot water, by which fome mills in
the neighbourhood are moved.
It cannot but appear furprifing, that nature has
placed nearly on the fummit of a volcanic mountain

Lipari. fprings which fupply fo confiderable a quantity of wa-
v ter# r0 account foi* fuch a phenomenon would be
well worthy of fome ingenious naturalift. Nor are
thefe hot fprings all •, proceeding around the fame hill,
at about a mile’s ditlance, we find a fpring of cold
water rifing from the fummit of the fame rock, which
on the north-weft produces three hot fprings. The cold
water is very pleafant to drink, and much ufed both
by men and cattle.
Among thefe mountains there are many enormous
loofe maffes of lava, the appearance of which, M.
Houel informs us, naturally leads the obferver to take
notice, that the lava of the volcano of Lipari is of a
much greater diverfity of colours, and thofe richer
and more lively, than the lava of Vefuvius and ./Etna.
The lava of Lipari is in fome places, for feveral miles,
of a beautiful red colour. It contains likewife in great
abundance fmall black cryftallized fcoriae, as well as
the fmall white grains which are commonly found in
lava.
Among the eminences which overlook the city of
Lipari, there are fome rocks of a fpecies which is very
rare in Europe. Thefe are large mafles of vitrified
matter, which rife fix or eight feet above the furface
of the ground, and appear to extend to a great depth
under it. They exift, through that range of moun¬
tains, in enormous maffes, mixed with lavas of every
different colour, and always (landing detached and in-
fulated. Were they cut and followed under ground,
they ivould probably be found to exift in immenfe
quarries in the bowels of the earth. The glafs of
which they confift might be employed with great ad¬
vantage in manufactures. It is ready made, and might
be eafily purified. It is green, compact, and tranf-
parent.
The cultivation of the ground is the chief employ¬
ment of the inhabitants of Lipari. The poffeflion of
a fewr acres of land here gives a man great importance.
Parents, wdien they fettle their children, rather give
them money than any part of their lands.
More than two-thirds of the ifland is planted with
vines: three-fourths of the grapes which thefe produce
are dried, and fent moftly to London under the name
of paflbla. There are different forts of paffola : one
of thefe, called the black pajfolina, is prepared from a
particular kind of grape, of which the berries are un¬
commonly fmall ; and fold to Marfeilles, Holland, and
Triefte. The vines are in fmall arbours, wThich rife
only to the height of twro feet and a half above the
ground. Under thofe arbours there grow beans, gourds,
and other leguminous vegetables. In fb hot a climate,
the ftiade of the vines does not injure ' but proteft the
vegetables growing under it : they would otherwife
be withered by the heat of the fun.
The method of preparing paffola and paffolina is
curious enough : They firft make a lixivium of com¬
mon aftres ; after boiling this, they pafs it through a
cloth or a fieve*, they then put it again on the fire*, and
when it is obferved to boil hard, fuddenly immerfe the
grapes, but inftantly bring them out again, and ex*
pofe them to the fun to dry on broad frames of cane.
When fufliciently dry, the raifins are put into calks
and barrels to be fold and exported. The number of
cafks of different forts of mfins annually exported from
Lipari are ellimated at ic,oco.

About 60 or 80 years fince, fulphur was one of the , ^ ,
articles with which the inhabitants of this ifland fup-
plied foreign merchants. But that trade has been gi¬
ven up; from an idea which the Liparefe entertain,
that fulphur infedls the air fo as to iniure the fertility
of the vines. The fame prejudice prevails in Sicily,
but it feems to be ill founded.
There are courts of juftice in Lipari of the fame
powders and charadler with thofe in the cities of Sicily.
Caufes of more than ordinary importance are carried to
Palermo.
The ifland is entirely free from every kind of im-
pofition. The king receives nothing from it; becaufe
Count Roger anciently beftowmd on its bilhop all his
rights of royalty over Lipari. The bifhop there re¬
ceived annually from the inhabitants a tenth part of
the produtts of their lands. They afterwards, to pre¬
vent fraud, eftimated the value of that tithe for one
year 5 and on the condition of their paying in future a
fum of money equal to what that year’s tithe was va¬
lued at, he not only gave up his right to the tithe, but
alfo ceded to them a confiderable extent of land which
belonged to him.

LIPPI, Lorenzo, a painter ofhiftoryand portraits,
was born in 1606, and learned the principles of paint¬
ing from Matteo Rofelli. He had an exquifite genius
for mufic and poetry, as wrell as for painting, and in
the latter his proficiency was lo great, that fome of
his compofitions in the hiftorical ftyle were taken for
thofe of Rofelli. However, growing at laft diffatisfied
with the manner of that mailer, he chofe the manner
of Santi di Titi, who was excellent both in defign and
invention, and appeared to have more of fimple nature
and truth in his compofitions than any other artift of
that time. At Florence Lippi painted many grand
defigns for the chapels and convents, by which he en¬
larged his reputation *, and at the court of Infpruck,
he painted a great number of portraits of the firft no-
F bility,

j J he was fond of imitating fimple nature without any em-

the correflnefs of his outline, and for the elegant dif-

where the bell libraries were open to him ; and he
fpent much labour in collating the MSS. of ancient
authors. He lived 13 years at Leyden •, during which
he compofed and publilhed what he efieeins his bell
works; but fettled at Louvain, where he taught polite
literature with great reputation. He was remarkable
for unlleadinefs in religion, fiu£luating often between
the Protellants and Papifis; but he became finally a
bigotted catholic. He died at Louvain in 1606; and
his works are collefted in fix volumes folio.

his pencil : although it mull be acknowledged, that he
could never totally divert himfelf of the ideas and tafte
peculiar to the Flemings. His fubjecrts ufually were
hiftories taken from the facred writings, or the repre-
fentations of rural fports, marriages, balls, and villagers
dancing, dreffed in Venetian habits ; all which lubje£ls
he painted in a fmall as well as a large fize, with a
number of figures, well defigned, and touched with a
great deal of delicacy. He was likewife accounted to
paint naked figures admirably, with natural and elegant
attitudes, and a very agreeable turn of the limbs.
A capital pidrture of this mailer is, Adam and Eve
lamenting the death of Abel; which is extremely ad¬
mired, not only for the expreflion, but alfo for the
beauty of the landfcape : and in the church of St Ni¬
cholas at Venice is another of his paintings, reprefent-
ing St Jerome in the defert, with a pen in his hand, and
his head turned to look at an angel, who is fuppoled
to be founding the laft trumpet. The colouring of
this picture is rather too red ; but it is defigned in a
fine ftyle, and charmingly penciled. The paintings of
this mafter are very rarely to be purchafed. He died
in 1629.
Ims, John Vander, of Breda, hiftorical painter, was
born at Breda about the year 1601, and became a dif¬
ciple of Cornelius Polemburg, whofe manner he imitated
with extraordinary exafhrefs, in the tint of his colouring,
his neatnefs of penci’fng, and the choice of his fubjefts.
There are fome paintings of this mailer’s hand, which,
though they appear to have fomewhat lefs freedom and
lightnefs of touch, are nearly equal to thofe of Polem¬
burg, and are frequently taken to be his. At Rotterdam,
in the pofieflion of Mr Biffchop, there is a delicate
painting reprefenting Diana in the bath, attended by~
her nymphs ; and his moft capital performance, in
England, is faid to be in the pofleflion of the vifcount
Middleton. The portrait of Vander Lis, painted by
himfelf, is in the pofleflion of Horace Walpole, Efq.
which is defcribed by that ingenious gentleman, as be¬
ing worked up equal to the fmoothnefs of enamel.
LISBON, the capital of the kingdom of Portugal,
fituated in the province of Eilremadura, on the banks
of the river Tagus, in W. Long. 9. 25. N. Lat. 38. 25.
It was anciently called Olifpo, Olijipfio^ and Ulyffpo,
which are fuppofed to be derived from the Phenician
Ulifubbo or Ohjippo, fignifying in that tongue a pleafant
bay, fuch as that on which this city Hands. It firli be¬
came confiderable in the reign of King Emmanuel; from
that time it has been the capital of the kingdom, the
refidence of its monarchs, the feat of the chief tribu¬
nals, and offices of the metropolitans, a noble univerfity,
and the receptacle of the richeft merchandife of the
Eaft and Weft Indies. Its air is excellent; being re-
freffied by the delightful fea breezes, and thofe of the
Tagus. The city extends for about two miles along
the Tagus; but its breadth is inconfiderable. Like old
Rome, it Hands on feven hills : but the ftreets in gene¬
ral are narrow and dirty, and fome of them are very
fteep: neither are they lighted at night. The churches,
in general, are very fine ; but the magnificence of the
chapel
.LIS [ 43 ] LIS
chapel royal is amazing. Here is one of the finefi:
harbours in the world ; and there were a great number
not only of fine churches and convents here, but alfo
of other public buildings, and particularly of royal pa¬
laces, and others belonging to the grandees j but the
greateft part of them, and of the city, were dellroyed
by a moft dreadful earthquake, on Nov. I. 1755. from
which it will require a long time to recover. The
inhabitants, before the earthquake, did not at moll
exceed 150,000. The government of it is lodged in
a council, confiding of a prefident, fix counfellors, and
other inferior officers. The harbour has water enough
for the larged diips, and room enough for 10,000 fail
without being crowded. For its fecurity, there is a
fort at the mouth of the river, on each fide, and a bar
that runs acrofs it, and is very dangerous to pafs with¬
out pilots. Higher up, at a place where the river is
confiderably contrafted, there is a fort called Torre de
Belem, or the Tower oj Belem, under whofe guns all
drips mud pafs in their way to the city ; and on the
other fide are feveral more forts. Before the earth¬
quake, mod of the private houfes were old and un¬
lightly, with lattice windows j and the number of con¬
vents and colleges amounted to 50, namely, 32 for
monks, and 18 for nuns. The king’s principal palace
dands on the river, and is large and commodious. Of
the hofpitals, that called the Great is obliged to re¬
ceive all perfons, of w’hat degree, nation, or religion
foever, without exception. At the village of Belem,
near Lilbon, is a noble hofpital for decayed gentlemen
who have ferved the king, and have not wherewithal
to maintain themfelves. That called the Houfe of Mercy
is alfo a noble charity. In the centre of the city,
upon one of the highell hills, is the cadle, wffiich com¬
mands the whole, being large and ancient, and having
always a garrifon of four regiments of foot. The
cathedral is a vad edifice of the Gothic kind, but
heavy and clumfy : it contains, however, great riches j
and is finely adorned within. The fquare called RoJJio is
large, and furrounded writh magnificent buildings.
The whole city is under the ecclefiadical jurifdidlion
of the patriarch, who was appointed in the year 17x7.
Here is alfo an archbidiop, who has, or at lead had,
before the ereftion of the patriarchate, a revenue of
40,000 crufadoes, or 6oocl. The univerfity, which
wras removed for fome time to Coimbra, but afterwards
redored to its ancient feat, makes a confiderable figure,
though much inferior to that of Coimbra.
LISBURN, a town of Ireland, in tha county of

LISLE, a large, rich, handfome, and ftrong town
of French Flanders, of which it is the capital, with a

The larged fquare, and the public buildings, are very *
handfome ; and they have manufactures of filks, cam¬
brics, and camblets, as well as other duffs,’ wdnch
have been brought to great perfection. It w’as taken
by the duke of Marlborough, after three months
fiege and the lofs of many thoufands of men, in 1708,
but reflored to the French by the treaty of Utrecht,
in confideration of their demoliffiing the fortifications,
of Dunkirk. It was befieged by the Audrians in 1792,
who on the 29th of September began a heavy cannon¬
ading ugainfl it, which continued inceffant till the 6th
of OClobtr, when they w-ere obliged to raife the fiege,
after having thrown into the city about 30,000 red-hot
balls, befides 6 00 bombs. It is feated on the river
Duele, 14 miles wed of Tournay, 32 fouth-w^ed of
Ghent, 37 north-wed of Mons, and 130 north of Paris.

Lisle, Jofeph Nicholas de, an eminent adrono-
mer and geographer, was born at Paris in the year
1668. His father having taught him the principles of
grammar, he afterwards attended leClures in the Maza¬
rine college, where he delivered his rhetorical exercifes
in 1706. A total eclipfe of the fun having taken
place on the 1 2th of March that year, his tafie for
mathematics was thus difeovered, and he wras accord-
ingly placed under a proper tutor, who taught him the
elements of geometry, fortification and mechanics j but
his favourite dudy was the fcience of adronomy.
In 1707 he was offered the place of an engineer at
Martinico, which made him acquainted with the art of
drawing, an acquifition which proved highly ufeful to
him in his geographical labours, and alfo in the dudy^
of adronomy. His father having got a copy of An
Account of a Voyage to the South fea from his foil’s
mafler, young de Lille was excited by the perufal of it
to the dudy of natural hiflory, and he began to make
colle&ions of infe&s, and Iketch their varieties j but
being afterwards perfuaded that fo extenfive a dudy,
requiring fuch immenfe colle£lions to be made as he
found in Aldrovandus, was wholly incompatible with
that unremitting attention which his favourite fcience
required, he relinquiffied it accordingly. The atten¬
tion he paid to aflronomical refearches was fo great,
that he was confidered as meriting the correfpondence
of fome of the ablefl adronomers of Europe at the early
age of 21. In 1709 he made a wooden quadrant,
which he divided with the utmod accuracy, and which
anfwered the intended purpofe in his early obfervations.
He likewife condrufted a table for M. Caffini, of the
right afeenfions and declinations, adapted to all the de¬
grees of latitude and longitude of the planets, and the
obliquity of the ecliptic ; this table was made ufe of by
M. Caffini in foretelling the occultations of the dars by
the moon.
De Lille being informed by Caffini in 1710 of .his
method of reprefenting an eclipfe of the fun, by the
projection of a terredrial parallel on a plane $ he in-
dantly conceived the idea of applying it to every part
of the earth, by means of a globe mounted and pre¬
pared for that purpofe- Such adronomers as he made
acquainted with his projeCl, conceived it to be imprac¬
ticable •, but when the machine was completed, they
bedowed the highefi encomiums on the noble invention.
The fird memorable obfervation made by de Lifle was
F 2 that
LIS [ 44 ] LIS
til at of the moon, on the 23d of January I 7 1 2, after
'”~v~ which his labours experienced fome interruption from
bodily indifpoiition. About this time the fit nation of
his father’s numerous family rendered it neceffary that
he fiiould provide for himfelf, fo that he was obliged to
make his aftronomical knowledge fubfervient to the ab-
furdities of afirology, receiving pecuniary prefents from
the regent for his fervices. He received alfo in 1715 the
grant of a penfion of 600 livres, on which occafion he
calculated tables of the m@on according to the Newto¬
nian theory, prior to Halley’s communications to him,
which were printed in 1719. De Lille was chofen a
member of the Academy of Sciences in 1714, on which
account his exertions were redoubled.
' In 1 7 20 he delivered a propofal to the academy for
afcertaining in France the figure of the earth, a defign
which was carried into execution fome years afterwards.
In 1723 he delivered to the fame academy a memoir
on the tranfits of Mercury, wherein a method of calcu¬
lating them was propofed by fciim, the way in which
they were to be obferved, and the inferences to be de¬
duced from thefe obfervations. Fie propofed the ufe
of the quadrant in obferving the tranfits of Venus and
Mercury, which has been found fuperior to any other
inftrument for that important purpofe, and is fanc-
tioned fince his day by the prafiice of the ableft aftro-
nomers.
Our dilfinguilhed philofopher came over to England
in the year 1724, where he became acquainted with
Newton and Halley, and had the honour of obtaining
their approbation. Newton made him a prefcnt of his
own portrait, and Halley gave him a copy of the tables
which he had publilhed in 1719. He was alfo created
a member of the Royal Society, and he enjoyed fimilar
honours from every literary fociety in Europe before
his death. In 1721 he received an invitation from
Peter the Great to go to Peterfhurgh, to fill the chair
of aftronomer in the Imperial Academy of Sciences.
On the death of that emperor, his fucceffor Catharine
renewed the invitation, offering him a confiderable pen¬
fion, of which he accepted, and, in 1726, fet out for
Peterfburgh, accompanied by his brother Lewis and M.
Vignon, who were to aft as his affiflants. He reached
Peterfburgh in the month of Oftober, and was efta-
blilhed in the obfervatory erefted by Peter the Great,
which he occupied for 21 years. It was in every
refpeft commodious, but extremely deficient in aftrono-
mical apparatus, which his own ingenuity and indefati¬
gable application in a great meafure fupplied.
A tranfit of Mercury over the fun’s difc was expeft-
ed in the year 1740, which would not be vifible in
Europe, and therefore de Lifle undertook a journey to
the diftant regions of Afia; but after travelling through
the inhofpitable wilds of Siberia, the cloudinefs of the
atmofphere prevented him from obferving the tranfit,—
a mortification which he endeavoured to fupport by his
geographical and phyfical remarks, and in drawing up
a defcription of the country. He conftrufted an in-
terefting map of Ruffia, affifted by his brother Lewis,
who was appointed to make obfervations in the moft
dillant parts of that immenfe empire. He was occafion-
ally employed for the long period of forty years, in
making meteorological obfervations, which he executed
with an accuracy almoft incredible.
4fter a number of difcouragements and difficulties,
and the irregular payment of his penfion, had been long Lifle.
experienced by dc Lifie at Peterfburgh, he returned
difgufted to his native place, and was chofen profeffor
of mathematics at the college-royal, where lie did the
molt effential fervice to the fciences, by the important
inflruftions which he gave to his numerous pupils,
many of whom became afterwards the molt diilinguuh-
ed charafters, fuch as M. M. de la Laude and Mef-
fier.
When the tranfit of Mercury over the fun was ea¬
gerly expefted in 1753 by the greateft aftronomers, de
Lifle publifhed an intereffing map of the world, repre-
fenting the effeft of Mercury’s parallaxes in different
countries, that fuch places might be known as were
proper for making thole obfervations on the tranfit as
might determine the diflance of the fun. As the ap¬
parent orbit of the planet traverfed nearly the centre of
the fun, de Lifle made ufe of this circumftance to de¬
termine the diameter of that luminary. The lait work
of our author which was inferted in the volumes of the
Lrench academy, was a memoir on the comet which
appeared in the year 1758, difeovered by a peafant in
the vicinity of Drefden.
It may perhaps be afferted with juflice, that the moft
important fervice which this great man rendered to af¬
tronomers was, his correftion of the double error of
Halley refpefting the tranfit of Venus, looked for in
the year 1761, as by this means he prevented many
learned men from undertaking long voyages in order
to obferve it. About the year 1754, de Lille was ap¬
pointed by the king of France, aftronomical geogra¬
pher to the marine, in which capacity he wTas to colleft
plans and journals of naval captains, to arrange them
methodically, and to make extrafts from them of what¬
ever might be beneficial to the fervice. About the
year 1758 he withdrew into quiet retirement at the ab¬
bey of St Genevieve, where much of his time was fpent
in devotional exercifes, and in afts of charity and bene¬
ficence. Still, however, he continued to profecute thofe
ftudies which had been fo dear to him during the earlier
part of his life; but in 1768 he wTas feized with a
fcorbutic complaint, of which he was cured by his me¬
dical friends ; but in the month of September the fame
year he was feized with a fpecies of apoplexy, which
carried him off on the nth day of that month, in the
81ft year of his age.
His extraordinary merit as a man of fcience may in
in fome meafure be gathered from this concife account
of his life; and as a citizen of the world his piety was
unaffefted, his morals pure, his integrity undeviatisg,
his fpirit generous and difinterefted, and his whole
manners highly amiable. The only publication of our
author’s, befides thofe already mentioned, confifted of
“ Memoirs illuftrative of the Hiftory of Aftronomy,”
in two volumes 4to.
Lisle, Sir John, a brave loyalift in the time of

Lismore, a borough town of Ireland, in the county
of Waterford, and province of Munfter, 100 miles
from Dublin ; N. Lit. 52. 5. W. Long. j. 50. It was
anciently called Lejfmore or Lios-more, i. e. the great
enclofure, or habitation ; it is now a bilhopric, and
formerly had an univerfity. St Carthagh or Mochuda,
in the beginning of the feventh century, founded an
abbey and fchool in this place, which in a (hort time
wras much reforted to, not only by the natives, but
alfo by the Rritons and Saxons, during the middle
ages. According to an ancient writer of the life of
St Carthagh, Lifmore was in general inhabited by
monks, half of it being an afylum into which no wo¬
man dared enter $ confifting entirely of cells and mo-
nafteries, the ruins of which, with feven churches, are
yet vifible. A caftle was built here by King John.
The file of Lifmore was in early ages denominated
magh /ha, or the “ chofen fhield,” being the fituation
of a dun or fort of the ancient chieftans of the Decies,
one of whom granted it to St Carthagh on his expul-
fion from the ahbey of Ratheny in Weftmeath. On
becoming an univerfity, Math Sgiath obtained the
name of Dunfginne, or the “ fort of the Salons,”
from the number of Saxons who reforted thereto : but
foon after, it was called Lios-more or Lefs-more, and
now Lifmore; the biftiopric of which was united to
that of Waterford in 1363, being 730 years after its
foundation. The public road to' Cork was formerly
through this place, and at that time it had a better
face of bufinefs. St Carthagh, who retired to this
place with fome of his religious in 636, to avoid the
fury of the then Iriflr monarch, tied his dilciples to a
moft ftridl rule of life ; they never were allowed the
ufe of flefti, fi(h, or fowl •, only the vegetables that
the ground produced at the expence of their own la¬
bour. Father Daniel, in his Hijioire Monajlique, men¬
tions one on the fame foundation in France, The
caftle here, which, as we have formerly mentioned, u7as
built by King John, was erefted in 1195 on the ruins
of the abbey of St Carthagh : it belonged to the duke Lifmore
of Devonihire, and gave birth to the great philofopher ^ |
Robert Boyle. In 1189 it was demoliftied by the 1 .1
IrAh, who took it by furprife. Being afterwards re-
edified, it was for many years an epifcopal refidence,
till Myler Magrath, archbhhop of Caftiel, and bfthop
of this fee, granted the manor of Lifmore to that not¬
ed fcholar and foldier Sir Walter Raleigh, in the reign
of Queen Elizabeth, at the yearly rent of 13I. 6s. 8d. *,
but that eftate was lopped oft' with his head in the
reign of King James I. After which it fell into the
hands of Sir Richard Boyle, who purchafed all Sir
Walter’s lands j he beautified the whole, and added
many buildings to it, moft of which w7ere burned down
in the IrAh rebellion ; at the breaking out of wdiich,
it was clofely befieged by 5000 Irifti commanded by
Sir Richard Beling, and was well defended by the
young Lord Broghill, third fon of the earl of Cork,
who obliged them to raife the fiege. The caftle is bold¬
ly feated on the verge of a rocky hill, rifing almoft per¬
pendicularly to a confiderable height over the river
Blackwater. The entrance is by an ancient and ve¬
nerable avenue of trees. Over the gate are the vener¬
able arms of the firft earl of Cork. Oppofite to the en¬
trance is a modern portico of Bath done, of the Doric
order, defigned by Inigo Jones. Moft of the buildings
have remained in ruins fince the era of the rebellion ;
but the feveral offices that make up twTo fides of the
fquare are kept in repair. At each angle is a tower,
the chief remains of its former magnificence. In O6I0-
ber 1783, the late duke of Rutland, then lord lieuten¬
ant of Ireland, whilll on a tour in Munfter, held a
council in, and iflued proclamations from this caftle.
The cathedral is ftill pretty well kept in repair. Here
is a fine bridge over the river Blackwater, eredled at a
very great expence by the duke of Devonftiire : this
bridge is remarkable for the extent of the principal
arch, the fpan of it being 102 feet. Below the town
is a rich fiftiery for falmon, which is the greateft branch
of trade here. Though this place is at prefent much
reduced, yet Cambrenfis informs us, that, not many
years after the conqueft, this w7as a very rich city, and

The civil lift is indeed properly the whole of the

and by the officers of the crown : it now {landing in

and as that has gradually diminiftied, the parliamen¬
tary appointments have increafed. The whole revenue
of Queen Elizabeth did not amount to more than
6oo,oool. a-year: that of King Charles I. was 8oo,ocol.
and the revenue voted for King Charles II. was
i,zoo,oool. though complaints were made (in the firft

it mufi: be obferved, that under thefe fums were includ¬
ed all manner of public expences 5 among which Lord
Clarendon, in his fpeech to the parliament, computed
that the charge of the navy and land forces amounted
annually to 8oo,oool. which was ten times more than
before the former troubles. The fame revenue, fubjefl
to the fame charges, was fettled on King James II. :
but by the increafe of trade, and more frugal manage¬
ment, it amounted on an average to 1,500,000k per
annum, (befides other additional cuftoms granted by
parliament, which produced an annual revenue of
400,000!.), out of which his fleet and army were main¬
tained at the yearly expence of 1,100,000k After
the Revolution, when the parliament took into its own
hands the annual fupport of the forces both maritime
and military, a civil lift revenue was fettled on the new

King George II. wras nominally augmented to 800,cool*,
and in fait was confiderably more : but that of his pre-
fent majefty is exprefsly limited to that fum $ though
2
loo.ocoh hath been flnce added. And upon the whole,
it is doubtlefs much better for the crown, and alfo for
the people, to have the revenue fettled upon the mo¬
dern footing rather than the ancient. Tor the crown,
becaufe it is more certain, and collected with greater
eafe 5 for the people, becaufe they are now delivered
from (the feudal hardftiips, and other odious branches
of the prerogative. And though complaints have iome-
times been made of the increafe of the civil lift, vet if
wre confider the fums that have been formerly granted,
the limited extent under which it is now eftabliihed,
the revenues and prerogatives given up in lieu of it by
the crown, the numerous branches of the prefent royal
familyq and (above all) the diminution of the value of
money compared with what it was worth in the laft
century, we muft acknowledge thefe complaints to be
void of any rational foundation j and that it is impof-
fible to fupport that dignity, which a king of Great
Britain ftiould maintain, with an income in any degree
lefs than what is now eftabliflied by parliament. See

comes from the Greek “ fupphcation j” of
\t}einvv, “ I befeech.”
At firff the ufe of litanies was not fixed to any dat¬
ed time, but were only employed as exigencies re¬
quired. They were obferved, in imitation of the Ni-
nevites, with ardent fupplications and fadings, to avert
the threatening judgements ot fire, earthquakes, inun¬
dations, or hoftile invafions. About the year 400, li¬
tanies began to be ufed in proceffions, the people
walking barefoot, and repeating them with great de¬
votion ; and it is pretended, that by this means feveral
counti es were delivered from great calamities. I he
days on which thefe were ufed were called rogation
days: thefe were appointed by the canons of different
councils, till it was decreed by the council of Toledo,
that they Ihould be ufed every month throughout the
year 5 and thus by degrees they came to be ufed week¬
ly on Wednefdays and Fridays, the ancient ftationary
days for falling. To thefe days the rubric of our
church has added Sundays, as being the greatel! days
for affembling at divine fervice. Before the laff review
of the common prayer, tha litany was a diftindt fervice
by itfelf, and ufed fome time after the morning prayer
was over •, at prefent it is made one office with the

LITCHFIELD, a city of Staffordlhire, in Eng¬
land, 1 1 7 miles from London. It Hands low, about
three miles from the Trent : and its ancient name is
faid to have been Licidjicld, fignifying, “ a field of
carcaffes,” from a great number of Chriftians having,
as it is pretended, fuffered martyrdom here in the per-
fccution under Dioclefian. In the Saxons time, it
was a biffioprick for a ffiort fpace ; and is now, toge¬
ther with Coventry, a bilhoprick. It is divided into
two parts by a rivulet and a kind of lhallowr lake, over
which are two caufeways wuth lluices. It is a long
ftraggling place •, but has feme very handlome houfes,
and well paved clean ftreets. That part on the fouth
fide of the rivulet is called the city, and the other the
clofe. The city is much the largeft, and contains feve¬
ral public llrudiures. It was incorporated by Edw. VI.
with the name of bailiffs and burgeffes; and is both a
town and county, governed by 2 bailiffs chofen yearly
out of 24 burgeffes, a recorder, a fheriff, a fteward, and
other officers. The city has power of life and death
within their jurifdi&ion, a court of record, and a pie¬
powder court. Here is a gaol both for debtors and
felons, a free fchool, and a pretty large well endowed
hofpital, for a mafter and 12 brethren. The county
of the city is 10 or 1 2 miles in compafs, which the
fheriff rides yearly on the 8th of September, and then
feafts the corporation and neighbouring gentry. The
clofe is fo called from its being encloied with a wail
and a deep dry ditch on all fides except towards the
city, where it is defended by a gre?.t lake or marTh
formed by its brook. The cathedral, which Hands in
the clofe, w'as originally built by Ofwius king of Nor¬
thumberland about 300. It was rebuilt and enlarged
by Offa king of Mercia in 766. In 1148 was rebuilt,
and greatly enlarged in 1296. At the reformation,
Coventry was divided from it. In the civil wars its
fpire was deflroyed, and it converted to a liable. In
1776 a beautiful painted window, by the benefa&ion
of Dr Adenbrook, has been fet up at the wellern end
of the cathedral. In the civil wars it was feveral times
taken and retaken, and thereby fuffered much 5 but
was fo repaired after the reftoration, at the expence of
2o,oool. that it was one of the faireft and nobleft
ftruefures of the kind in England. It is walled in like
a caftle, and Hands fo high as to be feen 10 miles round.
It is 430 feet long, of which the choir is no, and the
breadth in the broadeH place 80. Its portico is hard -
ly to be paralleled in England. There were, till lately,
26 flataes of the prophet', apoffles, kings of Judah,
and fome kings of this land, in a row above it, as big
as the life ; and on the top, at each corner of the por¬
tico, is a Hately fpire, befides a fine high ffeeple on the
middle of the church. The choir is paved in great
part with alabaffer and cannel coal, in imitation ot
black and white marble. In 1789 it underwent a
general repair, when the maffive groined arch betwixt
tbe well end of the church and the tranfept, which
had forced the fide wall out of its perpendicular, was
removed. The prebendaries Halls, which are thought
to be the beff in England, were moff of them re-ere61-
ed at the charge of the country gentlemen, whofe
names and arms are painted at the top of the Halls.
The north door is extremely rich in fculpture, but
much injured by time. The body which is fupported
by pillars formed of numbers of llender columns, has
lately had its decayed leaden roof replaced by a neat
Hated covering. The choir merits attention on ac¬
count of the elegant fculpture about the windows,
and the embattled gallery that runs beneath them ; to
which the altarpiece of Grecian architefture but ill
correfponds; behind which is Mary’s chapel, divided
from it by a moft elegant Hone Ikreen of beautiful work-
manfhip. Here Hood St Chad’s ffirine, wffiich coft

Here are three other churches j one of which, St Mi¬
chael’s, has a churchyard of 6 or 7 acres. There was

LITERATI (letrados, “ lettered”), an epithet gi¬
ven to fiich perfons among the Chinefe as are able to
read and write their language. The literati alone are
capable of being made mandarins.
Literati, is alfo the name of a particular fe<51,
either in religion, philofophy, or politics, confiding
principally of the learned men of that country j among
whom it is called i. e. “ learned.”
It had its rife in the year of Chrift 1400, when the
emperor, to awaken the native afie£lion of the people
for knowledge, which had been quite baniflied by the
preceding civil wars among them, and to, ftir up emu¬
lation among the mandarins, chofe out 42 of the ableft
among their doftors, to whom he gave a commiffion to
compofe a body of dodrine agreeable to that of the
ancients, which was then become the rule or ftandard
of the learned. The delegates applied themfelves to
the bufinefs with very great attention : but fome fancied
them rather to have wrefted the dodrine of the ancients,
to make it confift with theirs, than to have built up
theirs on the model of the ancients.
They fpeak of the Deity, as if it were no more than
mere nature or the natural power or virtue that pro¬
duces, difpofes, and preferves, the feveral parts of the
univerfe. It is, fay they, a pure, per fed principle,
_ without beginning or end j it is the fource of all things,
the effence of every being, and that which determines
it to be what it is. They make God the foul of the
world: they fay, he is diffufed through all matter,
and produces all the changes that happen there. In
Ihort, it is not eafy to determine, whether they refolve
God into nature, or lift up nature into God j for
they afcribe to it many of thofe things which we at¬
tribute to God.
This dodrine, in lieu of the idolatry that prevailed
before, introduced a refined kind of atheifm. The
work, being compofed by fo many perfons of learning
and parts, and approved by the emperor himfelf, was
received w ith infinite applaufe by all the people. Many
were pleafed with it, becaufe it feemed to fubvert all
religion ; others approved it, becaufe the little religion
that it left them could not give them much trouble.
And thus was formed the fed of the Literati : which
confifts of the maintainers and adherents to this doc¬
trine.
The court, the mandarins, and the perfons of for¬
tune and quality, &c. are generally retainers to it j but
a great part of the common people ftill hold to their
wrorfhip of idols.
The literati freely tolerate the Mahometans, becaufe'
they adore, with them, the King of heaven, and Au-
t hor of nature ; but they bear a perfed averfion to all
forts of idolaters among them : and it was once re-
folved to extirpate them. But the diforder this w^ould
have occafioned in the empire prevented it 5 they now7
content themfelves with condemning them, in general,
as herefies; which they do folemnly every year at Pe¬
kin.

LIT HGOW, William, a Scotfman, wdiofe luffer-
ings by imprifonment and torture at Malaga, and
whofe travels, on foot, over Europe, Alia, and Afri¬
ca, feem to raife him almofi. to the rank of a martyr
and a hero, publilhed an account of his peregrinations
and adventures. Though the author deals much in
the marvellous, the horrid account of the ilrange cruel¬
ties of which, he tells us, he was the fubjeft, have,
however, an air of truth. Soon after his arrival in
England from Malaga, he w’as carried to Theobald’s
on a feather-bed, that King James might be an eye-
witnefs of his martyred anatomy, by which he means
his wretched body, mangled and reduced to a fkeleton.
The whole court crowded to fee him ; and his majefty
ordered him to be taken care of, and he was twice
fent to Bath at his expence. By the king’s command
he applied to Gondamor, the Spanifh ambaffador, for
the recovery of the money and other things of value
which the governor of Malaga had taken from him,
and for 1000I. for his fupport. He wras promifed
a full reparation for the damage he bad fuftained : but
the perfidious minifter never performed his promife.
When he was upon the point of leaving England,
Lithgow upbraided him with the breach of his word
in the prefence-chamber, before feveral gentlemen of
the court. This occafioned their fighting upon the
fpot; and the ambaffador, as the traveller oddly ex-
prefles it, had his fiftula (with which diforder he was
affli&ed) contrabanded with his fill. The unfortunate
Lithgow, who was generally condemned for his fpi-
rited behaviour, was fent to the Marftialfea, where he
continued a prifoner nine months. At the conclufion
of the oflavo edition of his Travels he informs us,
that, in his three voyages, “ his painful feet have tra¬
ced over (befides paffages of feas and rivers) 36,000
and odd miles, which draw'eth near to twice the cir¬
cumference of the whole earth.” Here the marvellous
feems to rife to the incredible j and to fet him, in
point of veracity, below Coryat, whom it is neverthe-
lefs certain that he far outwalked. His defcriptiop of
Ireland is whimfical and curious. This, together with
the narrative of his fufferings, is reprinted in Morgan’s
Phoenix Britannicus.

LITHONTRIPTICS (from Xt6es “ a done,” and
“ to break”) ; an epithet for medicines that
are fuppofed to break the done in the bladder. Though
the different dones that are generated in the human
bladder require different folvents when out of the bo-
dv ; and though art hath not yet afforded a medicine
which, when injedted into the bladder, will, without
injury thereto, diffolve the done therein lodged ; it
cannot thence be concluded, that there are no lithon-
triptic medicines. It may be here obferved, that one
folvent affedls one fubjedl, but hath no effedl on ano¬
ther *, fo a folvent may yet be met with that will de-
llroy the done, and not hurt the human body. The
water into which the boiled white of egg diffolves will
liquefy myrrh, but may be put into the human eye
without cauiing any uneafinefs.

LITHUANIA, an extenfive province of Poland.
By the natives it is called Letwa, and has Great Po¬

ead ; Livonia, the Baltic iea, and part of Mufcovy,
on the north ; Red Rudia, Volhinia, and Podolia, on
the fouth; and the Ukraine on the fouth-ead. Its
length is faid to be about 360, and its breadth 340
miles *, but it is much indented both ways. Lithuania
was anciently overrun with wood 5 and there are dill
many foreds in it, which yield a great deal of honey,
wax, pitch, tar, and timber ; and abound with wild
boars, buffaloes, elks, wild horfes, wild affes, uri, and
woodcocks. 'The lakes are alfo numerous, and wTell
dored with fifh : but the air, by reafon of thefe foreds
and lakes, is faid to be thick and foggy. The country

neglected, but provifions are exceeding cheap, and money Ltmus,
fo fcarce, that 10 per cent, is the common intered. The ,
principal nobility have large edates, and live in great
pomp and fplendour, generally retaining fome hundreds
of thofe that are poor, in quality of domeftics. The
edablidied religion is Popery ; but Lutherans, Calvi-
nids, Jews, Turks, Greeks, and Socinians, are very
numerous. Lithuania was governed by its own dukes
till it was united to Poland, towards the end of the
14th century, when the great duke Jagello married
Hedwig, the dowager of Louis king of Poland and
Hungary. It had even dukes after that, but they
ivere fubordinate to the king •, and at this day, though
one diet ferves for both countries, yet each has its
peculiar lawrs, cudorcs, dialed!, and privileges. In a
diet held at Lublin in 1569, it was more clofely united
to Poland than it had been before j and it was enadled,
that both countries, for the future, diould form but one
date under the fame prince. As to their courts of juf-
tice, the tenth part of what is adjudged in all roal ac¬
tions goes always to the judge’s box, and is immediate¬
ly paid in court j and in perfonal adlions he claims
half the damages given. A nobleman is only fined for
murder, as in Poland. The dialed! is a language of
the Sclavonic ; and they fpeak here, as in Poland, a
barbarous kind of Latin. Lithuania is divided into
nine palatinates. Another divifion is into Lithuania
properly fo called, and Lithuanian Rudxa. Some alfo
comprehend under it Samogitia and Courland, which is
a fief of Poland.
LITMUS, or Lacmus, in the arts, is a blue pig¬
ment, formed from archil. It is brought from Hol¬
land at a cheap rate $ but may be prepared by adding
quicklime and putrified urine, or fpirit of urine ditli’-
led from lime, to the archil previoufly bruifed by grind¬
ing. The mixture having cooled, and the fluid fuffer-
ed to evaporate, becomes a mafs of the confidence of a
pafte, which is laid on boards to dry in fquare lumps. It
is only ufed in miniature paintings, and cannot be well
depended on, becaufe the leaft approach oi acid changes
it inftantly from blue to red. The heft litmus is very
apt to change and fly.
LIFTER (lediica), a kind of vehicle borne upon
fhafts ; anciently efteemed the rnoft eafy and genteel
way of carriage. Du Cange derives the word from the
barbarous Latin leBeria “ draw or bedding for beafts.”
Others will rather have it come from leBus “ bed
there being ordinarily a quilt and a pillow to a litter in
the fame manner as to a bed.
Pliny calls the litter the traveller's chamber ; it was
much in ufe among the Romans, among whom it was
borne by Oaves kept for that purpofe ; as it ftill conti¬
nues to be in the eaft, where it is called a palanquin—
The Roman leclica, made to be borne hy four men, was
called tetraphorum ; that borne by fix hexaphorum ; and
that borne by eight oSlaphorum.
The invention of litters, according to Cicero, w'as
owing to the kings of Bithynia : in the time of Tiberius
they were become very frequent at Rome, as appears
from Seneca j and even flaves themfelves were borne in
them, though never by more than two perfons, where¬
as men of quality had fix or eight.
Litter alfo denotes a parcel of dry old draw put on
the floor of a horfe’s Hall for him to lie down and reft
upon. When a horfe comes tired into a liable, frefh

litter has the virtue of making him ftale immediately.
I This is known to be a very great advantage to a horfe
' in a tired fiate } and when the litter is old and dirty, it
never has any fuch effect upon him. If the owners knew
how refrefhing it is for a horfe to difeharge his urine
on liis return from labour, they would be more care-
f’ul of giving them all means and occafions of it than
they are. This ftaling after fatigue prevents thofe ob-
ftruflions in the neck of the bladder or urinary paf-
lages which horfes are too fubjefl to.

Efq. of the county of Devon, by Elizabeth, lole
heirefs of Thomas ’Littleton of Frankley in Wor-
cefterftiire, at whofe requeft he took the name and
arms of that family. He was educated at one of our
univerfities, probably at Cambridge. Thence he re¬
moved to the Inner Temple, where he became one of
the readers; and was afterwards, by Henry VI. made
ifeward or judge of the court of the palace, or mar-
fhalfea of the king’s houfehold. In 1455, the thirty-
third of that reign, he was appointed king’s ferjeant,
and rode the northern circuit as judge of adize. In
J462, the fecond of Edward IV, he obtained a par¬
don from the crown j and, in 1466, w’as appointed
one of the judges of the common pleas, and rode the
Northamptonfhire circuit. In the year 1474 w^s»
with many of the firft nobility, created knight of tne
Bath. He died in 1481 > and was buried in the ca¬
thedral church of Worcefter, where a marble tomb,
with his ftatue upon it, was erefted to his memo¬
ry. As to his charafter as a lawyer, it is fufficient
to inform the reader, that he was the author of the
Treatife upon Tenures, on which Sir Edward Coke
wrote a comment, well known by the title of Coke
upon Littleton.
Littleton, Adam, defeended from an ancient
family in Shropfhire, was born in 16 27, educated at
Wellminfter fchool, and went to Oxford a fludent of
Chrift-church, whence he was ejeaed by the parlia¬
ment vifitors in 1648. Soon after, he became ufher
of Weftminfter fchool, and in 1658 was made fecond
inafler of Weftminfter fchool. After the relloration
he taught a fchool at Chelfea in Middlefex, of which
church he was admitted reaor in the year 1664. In
1670 he accumulated the degrees in divinity, being
then chaplain in ordinary to his majefty. In 1674, he
became prebendary of Weftminfter, of which church
he was afterwards iub-dean. Befide the well-known
Latin and Englijl Diftionary, he publifhed feveral
other works. He died in 1694, and was interred at
Chelfea. He was an univerfal fcholar 5 and extremely
charitable, humane, and eafy of accefs.
LITURGY, denotes all the cerempnies in general
belonging to divine fervice.
The word comes from the Greek “ fervice,
public miniftry}” formed of Tmros “ public,” and sgye»
** work.”
In a more reftrained fignification, liturgy is ufed a-
mong the Romanifts to fignify the mafs ; and among
us the common prayer.
All who have written on liturgies agree, that in the
primitive days divine fervice was exceedingly fimple,
only clogged with a very few ceremonies, and confift-
1kg of but a finall number of prayers ; but, by degrees,
1

they increafed the number of external deremonies, and Liturgyr
added new prayers, to make the office look more awful Lituu...
and venerable to the people. At length things tvere
carried to fuch a pitch, that a regulation became ne-
ccffary ; and it was found proper to put the fervice,
and the manner of performing it, into writing *, and
this was what they called a liturgy.
Liturgies have been different at different times, and
in different countries. We have the liturgy of St Chry-
foftom, that of St Peter, of St James, the liturgy of
St Baiil, the Armenian liturgy, the liturgy of the
Maronites, of the 'Cophtae, the Roman liturgy, the
Gallican liturgy, the Englifh liturgy, the Ambrofian
liturgy, the Spanifh and African liturgies, &c.
In the more early ages of the church, every biffiop
had a power to form a liturgy for his own diocefe ;
and if he kept to the analogy of faith and dosftrine, all
circumftances were left to his own diferetion. After¬
wards the practice was for the whole province to fol¬
low the metropolitan church, which alfo became the ge¬
neral rule of the church : and this Lindvvood acknow¬
ledges to be the common law of the church ; intimat¬
ing," that the ufe of feveral fervices in the fame pro¬
vince, which was the cafe in England, was not to be
warranted but by long cuftom. The liturgy of the
church of England was compofed in the year 1547,
and eftabliffied in the fecond year of King Edward VI.
flat. 2. and 3. Ed. VI. cap. I.
In the fifth year of this king it was reviewed ; be-
caufe fome things were contained in that, liturgy which
(bowed a compliance with the fuperftition of thofe
times, and fome exceptions were taken ag.ainft it by
feme learned men at home, and by Calvin abroad.
Some alterations were made in it, which confided in
adding the general confeffion and abfolution, and the
communion to begin with the ten commandments. 1 he
ufe of oil in confirmation and extreme undlion was
left out, and alfo prayers for fouls departed, and what
tended to a belief of Chrift’s real prefence in the eu-
charift. This liturgy, fo reformed, was eftabliiffied by
the ad of 5 and 6 Ed. VI. cap. 1. However, it was
abolifhed by (,)ueen Mary, who enaaed, that the ier-
vice (hould (land as it was moft commonly ufed in the
laft year of the reign of King Henry VIII. I he li¬
turgy of 5 and 6 Ed. VI. was re-eftabliffied with fome
few alterations and additions, by I Eiiz. cap. 2. Some
farther alterations wrere introduced, in confequence of
the review of the common-prayer book, by order of
King James, in the firft year of his reign j particular¬
ly in the office of private baptifm, in feveral rubricks
and other paffages, with the addition of five or fix new
prayers and thankfgivings, and all that pait of tne ca-
techifm which contains the doftrine of the facraments.
The book of common-prayer, fo altered, remained in
force from the firft year of King James to the four¬
teenth of Charles II. But the laft review of the li¬
turgy was m the year 1661, and the laft aA of uni¬
formity enjoining the obfervance of it is 13 and 14
Car. II. cap. 4. See CoMMOn-Prayer. Many appli¬
cations have been fince made for a review, but hither¬
to without fuccefs.

Lituus Quirinalis, from Quirinus, a name of Romulus,
who was Ikilled in all the myfteries of augury.
Lituus, was alfo an inftrument of mufic in ufe in
the Roman army. It was ftraight, excepting that it
had a little bending at the upper end like a lituus or
facred itaff of the augurs $ and from the fimilitude it
derived its nanfe.
LIVADIA, anciently Achaia and Hellas, or Greece
properly fo called ; a province of Turkey in Europe,
bounded on the north by Epirus and Theffaly, from
which it is feparated by Mount Oeta, now Banina, and
by the Euripus, now the flrait of Negropont; on the
eaft, by the Archipelago j on the fouth, by the gulf of
Engia or Egina, the ifthmus of Corinth, and the
gulf of Lepanto •, and on the weft, by the Ionian fea
and part of Epirus. Its extent is about 130 miles
from north-weft to fouth-eaft *, but its greateft breadth
is not above 36 miles. It is in general a mountainous
country j but neither unpleafant nor unfruitful. The
principal mountains are, Mount Oeta in Boeotia, where
is the famous pafs of Thermopylae, not above 25 feet
broad ; and Parnaffus, Helicon, and Cythaeron in Pho-
cis, which were facred to Apollo and the mufes, and
confequently much celebrated by the poets. The ri¬
vers of moft note are, the Sionapro, anciently the
Achelous, the Cephiffus, the Ifmenus, and the Afo-
pus. The province is at prefent divided into Livadia
proper, Stramulippa, and the duchy of Athens. The
principal places are, Lepanto, anciently Naupa&us;
Livadia, anciently Libadia or Lebadia j the celebrated
city of Athens, now Setines ; Thebes, now Stibes ;
Lepfina, anciently Eleufis j Caftri, formerly Delphi 5
and Megara.

LIVERPOOL, a large, flourilhing, and populous Liverpool,
town of England, in the county of Lancafter, fituated —y——'
at the influx of the river Merfey into the fea. This
town has fo much increafed in trade fince the com¬
mencement of the prefent century, that it is now the
greateft fea-port in England except London, having
exceeded Briftol confiderably of late years, which will
appear by the following account of the cuftom-duties,
received in the feveral ports of London, Liverpool, and
Briftol, in the year 1784, taken from the report of the
commiflioners for infpe&ing the ftate of public ac¬

The merchants here trade to all parts of the world ex¬
cept Turkey and the Eaft Indies; but the moft bene¬
ficial trade is to Guinea and the Weft Indies, by
which many of them have acquired very large for¬
tunes.
Liverpool, during the laft w'ar, carried on more fo¬
reign trade than any town in England $ and fuch is
the ftate of it at this time, that there are near three
thoufand veffels cleared from that port in one year to
different parts of the world. Here are feveral manu-
fadories for China-ware, and pot-houfes which make
very fine ware, fome falt-works, glafs-houfes, and up¬
wards of 50 breweries, from fome of which large quan¬
tities of malt liquor are fent abroad. Many of the build¬
ings are formed in the moft elegant manner ; but the
old ftreets are narrow 5 which defed will foon be re¬
moved, as the corporation have lately obtained an ad
of parliament for the improvement of the town, which ,
they have already begun to put in force with great fpi
rit, having taken down the principal ftreets in the
centre of the town, and rebuilt them in a fpacious and
moft magnificent manner; fo that in a few years it will
be one of the handfomeft towns in England. This
town contains fixteen churches, namely, St Peter’s, St
Nicholas’s, St George’s, St Thomas’s, St Paul’s,* St
Ann’s, St John’s, Trinity, St James’s, St Catharine’s,
St Mary’s, St Stephen’s, St Matthew’s, St Mark’s)
Chrift Church, and All Saints. There are alfo meet¬
ings for independents, anabaptifts, quakers, methodifts,
and prefbyterians. The exchange is a noble ftrudure,
built of white ftone in the form of a fquare, and round
it are piazzas where the merchants affemble to tranfad
bufmefs. Above it are the mayor’s offices, the feffions
hall, the council-chamber, and two elegant ball-rooms.
The expence of ereding this building amounted to
30,000b The cuftom-houfe is fituated at the head of
the old dock, and is a handfomp and convenient ftruc-
ture. Here are many charitable foundations, among
which is an excellent grammar fchool well endowed,
and many of the youth taught in it have exhibitions in
the univerfities. The infirmary is a large edifice of
G 2 jarick

airy fituation, at one end of the town.
In the town is a charity-fchool fupported by volun-
, tary fubfcriptions and contributions for 50 boys and
12 girls, who are not only clothed and educated, but
alfo provided with food and lodging : likewife feveral
alms-houfes for the widows of feamen j and an ex¬
cellent poor-houfe, fuperior to any in the kingdom,
where upwards of 800 men, women, and children, are
iupported, many of whom are employed in fpinning
cotton and wool. There are five large wet docks,
three dry docks, and feveral graving docks for the re¬
pairing or {hipping j which renders it the moft com¬
modious fea-port in the world. The quays which
bound thefe docks are covered with warehoufes ; which
is. a convenience that enables the merchant to difcharge
nis fh.ip at a very fmall expence. The newprilon late¬
ly finifhed is a noble edifice, being built entirely on the
plan of the great and benevolent Mr Howard, for foli-
tary confinement; and is perhaps the moft convenient,
airy, magnificent building of the kind of Europe } be¬
ing upon a very extenfive fcale.
Liverpool received its charter from King John •, but
it vyas a borough by prefcription long before his reign.
It is under the government of a recorder, mayor, and an
unlimited number of aldermen, two bailiffs, and a com¬
mon council of forty of the principal inhabitants, with
a town-clerk and other proper officers. The town
has a weekly market on Saturday, and is diftant from
London 204 miles. The progreffive rife of popula¬
tion in Liverpool, may be conceived by perufing the

The whole population of Liverpool in the year 1793
was computed to amount to 56,782.
By means of inland navigation, Liverpool has com¬
munication with the rivers Dee, Kibble, Oufe, Trent,
Darwent, Severn, Humber, Thames, Avon, &c. which
navigation, including its windings, extends above 500
xniles, in the counties of Lincoln, Nottingham, York,
Weftmorerand, Chefter, Stafford, Warwick, Leicefter,
Oxford, Worcefter, &c. The Merfey, upon which
the town is fituated, abounds with falraon, cod, floun¬
ders, turbot, plaice, and fmelts 5 and at full fea it is
aoove two miles over. In the neighbourhood are fre¬
quent horfe-races, on a five-mile courfe, the fineft for
tne leng.tn in England. I he foil in and near the
town is dry and fandy, and particularly favourable to
me growth 01 potatoes, on which the farmers often
depend more than on wheat or any other grain. Frefti
water is brought into the town by pipes, from fome
fprings four miles off, purfuant to an ad of parliament
m the reign of Oueen Anne. The dock duties of
2 J L I V
Liverpool in 1760 amounted to 2330b but in 1805 to Livery
33>364b an aftoniihing proof of the rapid increafe of its I]
trade. The difpenfary of this town does honour to hu- _LlV!U5,
man nature, and has been of the moft lingular advan- v
tage to the affncled, fince 172,273 perfons were cured
of every diforder incident to human nature, between
the years 1778 ar|d 1794? being on an average about
10,000 perfbns every year. The Union News Room
was inftituted on the iff of January 1801 j the Lyceum
much about the .fame period, the ere&ion of which cofl:
the fum of x 1,000b and the Commercial New’s Room
in 1803. The inftitution for reftoring drowned per¬
fons is worthy of notice, as more than 400 people have
become ohjeds of it fince it was founded, and more
than one half of that number have been reftored. The
Athenaeum, which comprifes a news room and library,
was projected in 1798, and finilhed before the clofe of
the year. I here are four weekly papers publiflied at
Liverpool. From 1783 to 1793 inclufive the value of
flaves imported into the Weft Indies in Liverpool vef-
fels, amounted to 15,186,850b fterling ; and" the ad¬
vantages which it derives from its inland navigation
are more than can be properly eftimated. Liverpool
fends two members to parliament.
LI v FRY, in matters of drefs and equipage, a
certain colour and form of drefs, by which noblemen
and gentlemen choofe to diftinguifh their fervaats.
Liveries are ufually taken from fancy, or continued
in families by fucceffion. T lie ancient cavaliers, at
their.tournaments, diftinguifhed themfelves by wearing
the liveries of their miftrefies: thus people of quality
make their domeftics wear their livery.
. Father Meneftrier, hi his Treatife of Caroufals, has
given a. very ample account of the mixtures of colours
in liveries. Dion tells us, that Oenomaus was the firit
who invented green and blue colours, for the troops
which, in the circus, were to reprefent land and fea
fights.
The Romifti church has alfo her feveral colours and
liveries white, for confeffors and virgins, and in times
of rejoicing 5 black, for the dead ; red, for the apoftles
and. martyrs 5 blue or violet, for penitents 5 and green,
in times of hope.
Formerly, great men gave liveries to feveral, who
were not of their family or fervants, to engage them
in their quarrels for that year ; but this was prohibited
by the ftatutes t Rich. II. 1 Hen. IV. cap. 27. 2 and
7 Hen. IV. 8 Hen. VI. cap. 4. 8 Ed. IV. cap. 2 j
and no man, of whatever condition, wxis allowed to
give any livery, but to his domeftic officers, and counfel
learned in the law. However, moft of the above fia-
tutes are repealed by 3 Car. I. cap. 4.

LIVERYMEN of London, are a number of rnen
chofen from among the freemen of each company. Out
of this body the common-council, fheriff, and other
fuperior officers for the government of the citv, are
elected 5 and they alone have the privilege of giving
their votes for members of parliament, from which the-
reft of the citizens are excluded.
LIVIQS, I itus, the heft of the Roman hiftori-
ans, as he is called by Mr Bayle, was born at Patavi-
um, or Padua. Few particulars of his life have beeiv

Livin':. Kanded down to us. Coming to Home, lie .acquired
^ the notice and favour of Auguftus, and there he long
redded. Some have fuppoied, (for there is not any
proof of it), that he was known to Auguftus before,
by certain Philofophical Dialogues which he had de¬
dicated to him. Seneca fays nothing of the dedication :
but mentions the dialogues, which he .calls hiftorical
and philofophical j and aifo home books, written pur-
pofely on the fubjeil of philofophy. Be this as it will,
it is probable that he began his hi (lory as loon as he
was fettled at Rome ; and he feems to have devoted
himfelf fo entirely to the great work he had underta¬
ken, as to be perfedftly regardlefs of his own advance¬
ment. The tumults and diftraflions of Rome frequent¬
ly obliged him to retire to Naples ; not only that he
might be lefs interrupted in the purfuit of his deftin-
ed talk., but alfo enjoy that retirement and tranquillity
which he could not have at Rome, and which yet he
feems to have much fought after : for he was greatly
diffatisfied with the manners of his age, and tells us,
that “ he ftiould reap this reward of his labour, in
compofmg the Roman hiftory, that it would take his
attention from the prefent numerous evils, at leaft:
while he was employed upon the firft and earlieft ages.”
He ufed to read parts of this hiftory, while he was
compofing it, to Meccenas and Auguftus •, and the lat¬
ter conceived fo high an opinion of him, that he pitch¬
ed upon him to fuperintend the education of his grand-
fon Claudius, who was afterwards emperor. After the
death of Auguftus, Livy returned to the place of his
birth, where he was received with all imaginable
honour and refpedl : and there he died, in the fourth
year of the reign of Tiberius, aged above feventy.
Some fay, he died on the fame day with Ovid : it is
certain that he died the fame year.
Scarce any man was evermore honoured, alive as
well as dead, than this hiftorian. Pliny the younger
relates, that a native gentleman travelled from Gades,
in the extremeft parts of Spain, to fee Livy: and,
though Rome abounded with more flupendous and cu¬
rious fpetftacles than any city in the world, yet he im¬
mediately returned ; as if, after having feen Livy, no¬
thing Lrther could be worthy of his notice. A mo¬
nument was erefted to this hiftorian in the temple of
Juno, where was afterwards founded the monaftery of
St Juftina. There, in 1413, was difeovered the fol¬
lowing epitaph upon Livy : OJJa Till Livii Patavim,
omnium mortalium judicio chgtu, cujus prope inviBo ca-
lamo invicii populi Romani res gejlce confcriberentur;
that is, “ The bones of Titus Livius of Patavium, a man
worthy to be approved by all mankind, by whofe almoft
invincible pen the acls and exploits of the invincible Ro¬
mans were written.” Thefe bones are faid to be pre-
ferved with high reverence to this day, and are Ihown-
by the Paduans as the moft precious remains. In
1451, Alphonfus, king of Arragon, fent his ambaffa-
dor, Anthony Panormita, to deftre of the citizens of
Padua the bone of that arm with which this their fa¬
mous countryman had written his hirtory ; and, ob¬
taining it, caufed it to be conveyed to Naples with the
greateft ceremony as a moft invaluable relic. He is
faid to have recovered from an ill ftate of health by
the pleafure he found in reading this hiftory : and there¬
fore, out of gratitude, put upon doing extraordinary
honours to the memory of the- writer. Panormita alfo.
who was a native of Palermo in Sicily, arid one of the
ableft men of the 15th century, lold an eftate to pur* v
chafe this hift0rian.
The hiftory of Livy, like other greaif-works of an¬
tiquity, is tranfmitted down to us exceedingly mutilated
and imperfect. Its books were originally a hundred ancl
forty-two, of which are extant only thirty-five. The
epitomes of it, from which we learn their number, all
remain, except thofe of the 136th and 137th books*
Livy’s books have been divided into decades, which
fome will have to have been done by Livy himfelf, be-
caufe there is a preface to every decade ; while others
fuppofe it to be a modern contrivance, fince nothing
about it can be gathered from the ancients. The firit
decade, beginning with the foundation of Rome, is ex¬
tant, and treats of the affairs of 460 years. The fe-
cond decade is loft •, the years of which are feventy-
five. The third decade is extant, and contains the fe*
cond Punic war, including eighteen years. It is re-
koned the moft: excellent part of the hiftory, as giving
an account of a very long and lharp war, in which the
Romans gained fo many advantages, that no arms could
afterwards withftand them. The fourth decade contains
the Macedonian war againft Philip, and the Afiatic
wTar againft Antiochus, which take up the fpace of
about 23 years. The five firft: books of the fifth de¬
cade were found at Worms, by Simon Grynseus, in,
1431, but are .very defective ; and the remainder of
Livy’s hiftory, which reaches to the death of Drufus in
Germany in 746, together with the fecond decade, are .
fupplied by Freinfhemius.
Never man perhaps was furnifhed with greater ad¬
vantages for writing a hiftory than Livy. Befides his
own great genius, which was in every refpedt admi¬
rably formed for the purpofe, he was trained as it were
in a city, at that time the emprefs of the world, and
in the politeft reign that ever was *, having fcarcely had
any other fchool than the court of Auguftus. He had
accefs to the very beft materials, fuch as the Memoirs
of Sylla, Caffar, Labienus, Pollio, Auguftus, and o-
thers, written by themfelves. “ What writers of me¬
morials (fays Lord Bolinbroke), what compilers of the
Materia Hiftorica, were .thefe ! What genius was ne-
ceffary to finifh up the pictures that fuch mafters had
Iketched ! Rome afforded men that were equal to the
talk. Let the remains, the precious remains, of Sal-
luft, of Livy, and of Tacitus, witnefs this truth. 
What a fchool of public and private virtue had been
opened to us at the refurreftion of learning, if the lat¬
ter hiftorians of the Roman commonwealth, and the
firft of the fucceeding monarchy, had come down to us
entire ! The few that are come down, though broken
and imperfeft, compofe the beft body of hiftory that
we have ; nay, the only body of ancient hiftory that
deferves to be an objeft of ftudy. It fails us indeed
moft at that remarkable and fatal period, where our
reafonable curiofity is railed the higheft. Livy em¬
ployed forty-five books to bring his hiftory down to thg
end of the fixth century, and the breaking out of the
third Punic war: but he employed ninety-five to bring
it down from thence to the death of Drufus j that is,
through the courfe of 120 or 130 years. Apffian,
Dion Caffius, and others, nay, even Plutarch included,
make us but poor amends for what is loft of Livy.”
Speaking then of Tally’s orations and letters, as the
I
L I V [ 54 1 L I V
Livius. bed adventitious helps to fupply this Tois, he fays, that
  the age in which Livy flounihed, abounded with
fuch materials as thefe : they were frelh, they were au¬
thentic : it was eafy to procure them •, it was fafe to
employ them. How he did employ them in executing
the fecond part of his defign, we may judge from his
execution of the firid : and, I own, I (hould be glad
to exchange, if it were poffible, what w?e have of this
hiftory for what we have not. Would you not be glad,
my Lord, to fee, in one ftupendous draught, the whole
progrefs of that government from liberty to fervitude j
the whole feries of caufes and effe&s, apparent and real,
public and private ?” &c.
The encomiums bellowed upon Livy, by both an¬
cients and moderns, are great and numerous. He not
only entertains like Herodotus ; he alfo inftrudts and
interells in the deepeft manner. But his great probity,
candour, and impartiality, are what have diftinguilh-
ed Livy above all hiilorians } for neither complaifance
to the times, nor his particular connexions with the
emperor, could reilrain him from fpeaking w'ell of Pom-
pey j lb well, as to make Auguftus call him a Pom¬
peian. This we learn from Cremutius Cordus, in i a-
citus } who relates alfo, much to the emperor’s ho¬
nour, that this gave no interruption to their friend-
Ihip. But whatever elegies Livy may have received
as an hiitorian, he has not efcaped cenfure as a writer.
In the age wherein he lived, Alinius Poliio charged
him with Patavinity 5 which Fatavinity has been vari-
oufly explained by various writers, but is generally fup-
pofed to relate to his tfyle. The moll common is, that
this noble Romdn, accuftomed to the delicacy of the
language fpoken in the court of Auguftus, could not
bear with certain provincial idioms, which Livy, as a
Paduan, ufed in divers places of his hiftory. Pignorius
is of another opinion, and believes that this Patavinity
regarded the orthography of certain words, vdierein Livy
ufed one letter for another, according to the cuftom of
his country, and quofe for Jibi and quaji;
which he attempts to prove by feveral ancient inferip-
tiems. The exprefliom, however, or the orthography
of words, are not loaded with obfeurity, and the per-
fe-il claffic is as familiarly acquainted with thofe fup-
pofed provincialifms as with the pureft Latinity.—Livy
has been cenfured too, and perhaps with juflice, for be¬
ing too credulous, and burdening bis hiftory with vul¬
gar notions and fuperftitious tales. He may difguft
when he mentions that milk and blood were rained from
heaven, or that an ox fpoke or a woman changed her
fex ; yet he candidly confeffes that he recorded only
what made an indelible impreuion upon the minds of a
credulous age.
Is it worth ■while to mention here the capricious and
tyrannic humour of the emperor Caligula, who accufed
Livy of being a negligent and wordy writer, and reiol-
ved therefore to remove bis works and ftatues out of all
libraries, where he knew they were curioufly preierved ?
Or the fame humour in Domitian, another prodigy of
nature, who put to death Metius Pompofianus, becaufe
he made a colleftion of fome orations of kings and ge¬
nerals out of Livy’s hiftory ? Pope Gregory the Great,
alfo, would not fufter Livy in any Chriftian library, he-
caufe of the Pagan fuperftition wherewith he abounded :
but the fame reafon held good again ft all ancient au¬
thors 5 and indeed Gregory’s zeal w^as far from being
3
levelled at Livy in particular, the pontiff having decla¬
red war againft all human learning. . ^
Though we know nothing of Livy’s family, yet we
learn from Quintilian, that he had a fon, to whom he
addrefled fome excellent precepts in rhetoric. An an¬
cient infeription fpeaks alfo of one of his daughters,
named Livia ^uarta : the fame, perhaps, that efpoufed
the orator Lucius Magius, whom Seneca mentions ;
and obferves, that the applaufes he ufually received
from the public in his harangues, were not fo much
on his own account, as for the fake of his father-in-
law.
Our author’s hiftory has been often publiftred with
and without the fupplement of Freimhemius. The
heft editions are, that of Gronovius, cum notis vario-

Clerc at Amfterdam, 1709, 10 vols i2tno; and that
of Crevier, at Paris, 1735, 6 vols 4to. Thefe have
the fupplements.—Learning perhaps never fuftained a
greater lofs, in any (ingle author, than by the deftruc-
tion of the latter and more interefting part of Livy.
Several eminent moderns have indulged the pleafmg ex-
pedlation that the entire work of this noble kiftorian
might yet be recovered. It has been faid to exift in an
Arabic verfton : and even a complete copy of the ori¬
ginal is fuppoled to have been extant as late as the year
1631, and to have periftied at that time in the plunder
of Magdeburg. The munificent patron of learning,
Leo X. exerted the moft generous zeal to refeue from
oblivion the valuable treafure, which one of his moft
bigotted predeceffors, above mentioned, had expelled
from every Chriftian library. Bayle has preierved, un
der the article Leo, two curious original letters of that
pontiff, concerning hk hopes of recovering Livy; which
afford moft honourable proofs of his liberality in the
caufe of letters.—A lately difeovered fragment of Li¬

Livius Andronicus, a comic poet who flouriftied at
Rome about 240 years before the Chriftian era. He

nine verfes, fo long the admiration of tne Romans, in¬
to the form of a proper dialogue and regular play.
Though the charafter of a player, fo valued and ap¬
plauded in Greece, was reckoned vile and defpicable
among the Romans, Andronicus afted a part in his
dramatical compofitions, and engaged the attention
of his audience, by repeating what he had laboured
after the manner of the Greeks. Andronicus was the
freedman of 1M. Livius Salinator, whofe children he
educated. His poetry was grown obfolete in the age
of Cicero, whole nicety and judgement would not even
recommend the reading of it.
LIVONIA, a large province of the Ruffian empire,

cow, and partly by Novogorod. It is about 230 miles
from north to foutb, and 150 from eaft to weft. The
land is fo fertile in corn, that it is called the granary of
the north : and would produce a great deal more, if it
was not fo full of lakes. The fifh that abound here are
falmons, carps, pikes, fiat filh, and many others. In

LOCK, a well-known inllrument ufed for faftening
doors, chefls, &c. generally opened by a key.
The lock is reckoned the maflerpiece in finithery ;
a great deal of art and delicacy being required in con¬
triving and varying the wards, fprings, bolts, &c. and
adjufting them to the places where they are to be ufed,
and to the various occafions of ufing them.
From the various ftnnfture of locks, accommodated
to their different intentions, they acquire various names.
Thofe placed on outer doors are called flock-locks; thofe
on chamber doors, flpring-locks; thofe on trunks, trunk-
locks, paddocks, &c.
Of thefe the fpring-lock is the moft conflderable,
both for its frequency and the curiofity of its ftrufture;
Its principal parts are, the main-plate, the cover-plate,
and the pin-hole : to the main-plate belong the key¬
hole, top-hook, crofs-wTards, bolt-toe or bolt-knab,
drawback-fpring tumbler, pin of the tumbler, and the
flaples ; to the cover-plate belong the pin, main-ward,
crofs-ward, ftep-w’ard or dap-ward ; to the pin-hole
belong the hook-ward, main crofs-ward, {hank, the pot
or bread, bow-ward, and bit.
As on the proper conftru<ftion of locks the fecurity
of the moft valuable kinds of property almoft entirely
depends, and as numberlefs devices are continually
fallen upon to elude the utmoft efforts of mechanical
invention in this refpeift, it thence becomes an objeift
of no fmall importance to invent a lock which it (hould
be impoflible to open except by its proper key. A trea-
tife upon this fubject has been publifhed by Mr Jo-

Lack, feph Brawah ; who is confident that he has brought
“"v—the matter to the requifite perfection, and that every¬
one may reft affured of the fecurity of his property
when under the protection of a lock of his invention.
He begins with obferving, that the principle on which
all locks depend, is the application of a lever to an in¬
terior bolt, by means of a communication from with¬
out; fo that, by means of the latter, the lever aCts
upon the bolt, and moves it in fuch a manner as to
fecure the lid or door from being opened by any pull
or pufti from without. The fecurity of locks in ge¬
neral therefore depends on the number of impediments
we can interpofe betwixt the lever (the key) and the
bolt which fecures the door ; and thefe impediments
are well known by the name of wards, the number and
intricacy of which alone are fuppofed to diftinguifti a
good lock from a bad one. If thefe wards, however,
do not in an effectual manner preclude the accefs of all
other inftruments befides the proper key, it is ftill
poflible for a mechanic of equal fldll with the lock-
maker to open it without the key, and thus to elude
the labour of the other.
“ Locks (fays our author) have been conftruCfed,
and are at prefent much ufed and held in great efteem,
from which the picklock is excluded : but the admif-
Jfion of falfe keys is an imperfeCtion for which no lock-
fmith has ever found a correftive 5 nor can this imper-
fedlxon be remedied whilft the proteffion of the bolt
is wholly confided to fixed wardsy This pofition is
proved by a remark, that the wards, let them be as
intricate as we pleafe, muft all be exprefted on what is
called the bit or web of the key : and therefore, when
all the varieties that can be expreffed on this bit orw7eb
have been run through, every fucceeding lock muft be
the counterpart of fome other j and confequently the
fame key which opens one will open the other alfo.
This is evident from the locks ufually put upon drawers;
and which, though they fhould be made to refill the
picklock, are ftill liable to be opened by ten thoufand
other keys befides that appropriated to each of them.
But though the variety of wTards could be augmented
even to infinity, ftill there could be no fecurity againft
falfe keys ; for as every one of the wards muft be ex¬
preffed on the wreb of the key, if another key with a
web quite plain be made to fit the key-hole exadlly,
we have only to cover it over with fome colouring fub-
ftance upon which the wards may make an impreflion ;
after which, it is eafy to cut out the web in a proper
manner for admitting them, wdien the lock will be as
eafily opened by the falfe as by the true key.
The firft perfon, according to our author, who had
any claim to merit in the branch of lock-making, is
Mr Baron ; whofe lock he acknowledges to be by far
more perfect and fecure than any that ever appeared
before ; though he ilill confiders it as unfit for giving
that abfolute fecurity which is to be wiflied for. His
improvement confided in the proper application of
what are called tumblers. “ Thefe (fays Mr Bramah)
are a kind of grapple ; by wrhich the bolt is confined,
as well in its adiiye as in its paflive ftation, and render¬
ed immoveable till fet at liberty by the key. One of
thefe inftruments is commonly introduced into all locks
that are of any ufe or value ; it is lodged behind the
bolt, and is governed by a fpring which a£ts upon the
tumbler as the tumbler a£ts upon the bolt : The ao-
^ . Vol. XII. Part I.
plication therefore of any force to the tumbler, wdiich Lock,
is fuperior to the force of the fpring, will caufe it to —""''v-"*
quit its hold, and fet the bolt at liberty.” In the
common method of applying thefe machines, however,
it matters nothing how far the tumbler is lifted above
the point at which it ceafes to controul the bolt ; but
it is otherwife in thofe of Mr Baron’s cooftnnSion.
The adlion of his tumblers is circumfcribed by a cer¬
tain fpace cut in the centre of the bolt, of dimenfions
fufficient only to aniwer the purpofe intended. The
fpace in which the tumbler moves is an oblong fquare ;
and is not only furnished with niches on the under fide,
into which the hooks of the tumblers are forced by the
fpring as in other locks, but is provided w'ith cor-
refpondent niches on the other fide, into w'hich the
hooks are driven, if any greater force be applied to the
tumblers than what is juft fufficient to difengage them
from the bolt. Hence it becomes abfolutely neceffary,
in the making of a falfe key, to coiiftrudf it in fuch a
manner, that it may with the greateft exaclnefs give
the requifite degree of preffure, and no more.
Mr Bramah allows that this is a very great improve¬
ment, but obje&s that it is ftill poffible to frame a key
which will open it as well as its own ; nor will the ad¬
dition of any number of tumblers preclude the poffibi-
lity of opening it. “ By giving (fays he) an uniform
motion to the tumblers, and prefenting them with a
face w'hich exaftly tallies with the key, they ftill par¬
take, in a very great degree, of the nature of fixed
wards ; and the fecurity of this lock is thereby render¬
ed in a proportionable degree defedlive. Thus, fup-
pofe the falfe key to have paffed the wards, and to be
in contadl with the moft prormnent of the tumblers,
the impreffion, which the llighteft touch will leave on
the key, will diredl the application of the file till
fufficient fpace is prepared to give it a free paffage.
The key will then bear upon a more remote tumbler ;
which difficulty being in like manner got over, the
lock wall be as eafily opened by the falfe as by the true
key.”
This feemingly infuperable objedlion to the perfec¬
tion of lock-making, howTever, our author removes with
the greateft eafe imaginable, by caufing the tumblers
which project unequally to prefent a plane lurface :
whence they would require a feparate and unequal mo¬
tion to difengage them ; of conlequence no diftindl im¬
preffion could be made by them upon the plane lurface
of the wTeb that would give any idea of their pofitions
with regard to one another, and the conftrudfion of a
falfe key would be altogether impoffible.
But though the principal difficulty with regard to
Mr Baron’s lock be now overcome, others ftill occur,
viz. the difficulty of making locks which are conftrudt-
ed v\ith tumblers fufficiently durable. The tumblers
themfelves, he obferves, muft be but (lightly made;
and being expofed to perpetual friftion by the key and
their own proper motion, they muft loon decay ; and
the keys of Mr Baron’s locks, he alfo obferves, are
much lefs durable than thofe of any other locks he
ever faw.
With regard to the lock wdiich Mr Bramah pre-
fents to the public as abfolutely perfect, he informs
us, that the idea of conftru£Hng it was firft fuggelted
by the alarming increafe of houfe robbeiies, which may
reafonably be fuppofed to be perpetrated in a great

Lock, meafuve by perrdious fervants, or acconiplifbed by their
— connivance. Thus it is evidtnt, that the locks which
miaht exclude ordinary houfebreakers could be no he
curity againld faithlefs fervants, who having con'dant
accels to the locks, might eafily get falfe keys fabri¬
cated at their leifure. In confidering the fubjedl, our
author was convinced, that his hope of fuccefs de¬
pended entirely upon his ufing means as diilimilar as
poffible to thole by which the old locks were con-
ftrudled } as thefe, however varied,, had been found
insufficient for the purpofe. “ As nothing (fays he)
can be more oppofite in principle to fixed xvards than
a lock which derives its properties from the motion of
all its parts, I determined that the conftruhtion of fuch
a lock ffiould ba the fubjedt of my experiment.” In
the profecution of this experiment he had the fatisfac-
tion to find, that the lead perfeft of all his models
fully afcertained the truth and certainty of his prin¬
ciple. The exclufion of wards made it neceffary to cut
oft' all communication between the key and the bolt;
as the fame paflage, which (in a lock fimply conftrucl-
ed) would admit the key, might give admiffion like-
wdfe to other indruments. The office, therefore, which
in other locks is performed by the extreme point of
the key, is here affigned to a lever, which cannot ap¬
proach the bolt till every part of the lock has under¬
gone a change of pofition. The neceffity of this change
to the purpofes of the lock, and the abfolute impofli-
bility of effecting it otherwife than with the proper
key, are the points to be afcertained } and this our
author does in the following manner.
rcxCVI Fig. 1. Shows Mr Bramah’s firft attempt to con-
ftrudi a lock upon this principle : which, to his fur-
prife, turned out complete and perfecf. A reprefents
a common axis on which the fix levers, croffing the
face of the lock, are united as on a joint. Each of
thefe reds upon a feparate fpring fufficiently ftrong to
bear its weight; or, if depreffed by a fuperior force,
to reftore it to its proper pofition when that force is
removed. B reprelents a frame through which the
levers pafs by feparate grooves, exadlly fitted to their
width, but of fufficient depth to allow them a free
motion in a perpendicular diredlion. The part which
projedls from the oppofite fide of the joint A, and is
inferted in the bolt C, is a lever to which two offices
are affigned; one to keep the bolt in a fixed pofition,
in the abfence of the key ; the other, to give it its
proper motion upon the application of the key. D is
a circular platform turning upon a centre. On this
v the joint or carriage of the levers, and the fprings on
which they red, are fixed ; and the motion of this plat¬
form impels i*he bolt, in either direction, by means of
the lever which is projected from the joint A. The
inviolable reftraint upon this lock, by which means it
is fubjedled only to the adlion of the key, is lodged in
the part E, which is a thin plate, bearing at each ex¬
tremity on a block, and having of courfe a vacant fpace
beneath, equal in height to the thicknefs of the blocks
on wffiich it reds. By this plate the motion of the
machine is checked or guided in the following manner:
On the edge of the plate which faces the movement
there are fix notches which receive the ends of the
levers projedling beyond the frame B j and while they
are confined in this manner the motion of the machine

is fo totally fufpended as to defy every power of art Lock,
to overcome. 1 v~"*
To underftand in what manner the proper key of
this lock overcomes thefe obdacles, it mud be observ¬
ed, that each lever has a notch on its extremity, and
that thole notches are dilpofed as irregularly as pof¬
fible. To give the machine a capacity of motion, thefe
notches mud be brought parallel to each other, and
by a diftinft but unequal preffure upon the levers, be
formed into a groove in a direft line with the edge of
the plate E, which the notches are exadlly fitted to
receive. The lead motion of the machine, while the
levers afe in this petition, will introduce the edge of the
plate into the groove ; which, controuling the power
of the fprings, will give liberty to the levers to move in
a horizontal diredlion as far as the fpace between the
blocks which fupport the plate E will admit, and
which is fufficient to give the machine a power of add¬
ing on the bolt. The impodibility of thus bringing
the notches on the points of the levers into a diVedt
line, fo as to tally with the edge of the plate E by any
other means than the motion and impulfe of the key,
is that which conditutes the principal excellency of this
lock.
The key (fig. 2.) exhibits fix different furfaces,
againd which the levers are progreffively admitted in
the operation of opening the lock : the irregularity of
thefe furfaces {hows the unequal and didindt degree of
preflure which each lever requires to bring them to
their proper bearings, in order to put the machine in
motion. Hence it appears, that unlefs the various
heights of the furfaces expreffed on the bit of the key
are exadtly proportioned to the feveral diftances necef¬
fary to bring the notches into a draight line with each
other, they mud remain immoveable •, “ and (fays our
author) as one droke of a file is fufficient to caufe
fuch a difproportion as will prove an infurmountable
impediment to their motion, I may fafely affert, that
it is not in art to produce a key or other infirument,
by which a lock, confirudled upon this principle, can
be opened.”
On this principle it would even be a matter of great
difficulty for any workman, however {kilful, to condrudt
a key for the lock when open to his infpedlion : “ for
the levers being raifed, by the fubjacent fprings, to an
equal height in the frame B, prefent a plane furface }
and confequently convey no diredfion that can be of
any ufe in forming a tally to the irregular furface which
they prefent when adling in fubjedfion to the key.
Unlefs therefore we can contrive a method to bring
the notches on the points of the levers in a diredl line
with each other, and to retain them in that pofition
till an exadf impreffion of the irregular furface, which
the levers will then exhibit, can be taken 5 the workman
will be unable to fit a key to the lock, or to move the
bolt. This procefs mud be rendered extremely trou-
blefome by means of the fprings 5 and if fuch diffi¬
culties occur, even when the lock is open to the in-
fpedlion of a fkilful workman, much more mud we
fuppofe it out of the power of one who has not
accefs to the internal parts to make a falfe key to a
lock of this kind.
Thefe difficulties render it neceffary in making locks
of this kind not to fit the key to the lock, as is ufual
in.
LOG [ 59 ] L O C
in other locks, but to fit the lock to the key. In
this kind of lock, therefore, the key muft be made firftj
and the inequalities upon the furface of the bit work¬
ed as chance or fancy may diredt, without any refer¬
ence to the lock. The key being thus completed,
and applied to the furface of the levers, will, by a gen¬
tle preffure, force them to unequal diftances from their
common ftation in the frame B, and fink their points
to unequal depths into the fpace beneath the plate E.
While the levers are in this pofition, the edge of the
plate E will mark the precife point at which the notch
on each lever muft be expreffed. The notches being
cut by this diredlion, the irregularity which appears
when the levers refume their ftation in the frame B,
and the inequality of the receiTes on the bit of the
key, will appear as a feal and its correfponding im-
preffion.
The following is a lock contrived upon the fame
principle, but more curious ; and, in our author’s opi¬
nion, more extenfively ufeful. Fig. 3. reprefents a
circular block of metal divided from the centre into
eight compartments, each containing a cell which forms
a paflage through the block, as is reprefented by the
fmall circles defcribed on the flat furface A. In each
of thefe cells two grooves are cut at oppofite points,
which open a communication with the centre at one
point, and with the fpherical furface of the block or
barrel at the other. The fmall circle, which marks
the centre of the flat furface A, is the key-hole, which
likewife forms a paffage through the barrel in a parallel
line with the cells which furround it. This figure re¬
prefents the frame in which the adlive parts of the lock
are depofited.
Fig. 4. {hows a fpiral fpring lodged in the bottom
of each cell, and occupying one half of the fpace, the
other being filled with a Aider refting upon the fpring,
and reprefented by fig. 5. the office of thefe Aiders ex-
adtly correfponding wfith that of the levers in the lock
already defcribed. Thus, when lodged in their refpec-
tive cells, they are fuftained, like the levers, by the
elafticity of the fprings upon which they reft, till a fu-
perior power be applied j and they are again reftored
to their ftations by the readtion of the fprings wffien
the weight is removed. The fide B of each Aider is
projedled beyond the circular furface, as reprefented
fig. 6. in a manner fimilar to the projedlion of the le¬
vers in the former lock beyond the curved frame in
which they move. The point C is projedled through
the interior groove into the fpace which forms the cen¬
tre or key-hole, exprefled on the flat furface A.
Fig. 7. reprefents the key. When this is applied,
it muft of courfe encounter thefe interior projedlions ;
and when prefled forward, the indented fpaces on its
point being unequal, will force the Aiders to unequal
diftances from their bearers 5 bringing the notches ex¬
prefled on their exterior projedlions in a diredt line with
each other, in a manner fimilar to that by which the
eflfedl is produced upon the levers in the former lock.
When the key is withdrawn, and the Aiders refume their
Aations by the preflure of the fprings, the difpofition
of the notches muft be irregular in the fiime proportion
that the indentations on the point of the key are un¬
equal ; and they muft neceflarily fall again into a
flraight line when adled upon by the key.
Fig. 6. (hows the barrel completely fitted for adfion.
Its interior end is caped with a plate, which unites Lock,
its compartments, and confines the fprings and Aiders
within the cells to which they belong. From that plate
proceeds the point A, which reprefents the lever by
which the bolt is projedled or withdrawn, according
to the diredlion in which the machine performs its re¬
volution.
Fig. 8. Arow’S the Aat furface of a thin plate, corre*
fponding in its office with the part C of the former
lock. The fpace cut in its centre is exadlly fitted to
the fpherical furface of the barrel; the circle defer!bing'
its circumference, and the notches cut on its edge co¬
inciding with the projedlions of the Aiders. The barrel,
when encircled with this plate at the middle of its fphe¬
rical furface, has its motion totally fufpended till the
notches on the projedlions of the Aiders are forced, by
the preffure of the key, into a line wdth each other : a
groove being thus formed on the fpherical furface of the
barrel parallel to, and coinciding with, the edge of thft
plate, the machine is at liberty to perform a revolution
in any diredlion, but returns to its confined ftate when
the key is withdrawn.
The parts of the movement being thus united, the
interior end of the barrel is depofited in a bed repre¬
fented fig. 9. J'o this it is faftened at the angles of
the plate reprefented fig. 8. by which the barrel is en¬
circled. The tlation of the bolt is at A j the lever
which adls upon it being projedled on the other fide.
Fig. 10. is a cap or malk which covers the face of the
movement, and completes the lock.
On this lock our author obferves, that it is excellent
for ftreet doors : “ for no method of robbery (fays he)
is more pradlifed, than gaining admittance into houfes
by thofe keys, which as is well known, may be pro¬
cured at the old iron (hops to fit almoft any lock in
ufe. Such robberies are generally committed where
the fervants are allowed to take the key with them
when fent on errands, it being impradlicable while the
key is fixed in the lock. The variations, by which
the produdlion of correfpondent keys is avoided, have
two fources : the one arifing from the changes that may
be made in the difpofition of the levers •, the other from
the number of points contained on the projedled fur¬
face of each lever ; by which the pofition of its notch
may, in the fmalleft degree, be varied.
“ The variations produceable in the difpofitions of
fix figures only, are 720 : thefe, being pregreAively
multiplied by additional figures, will increafe by afto-
mAring degrees; and eventually {how, that a lock con¬
taining twelve levers will admit of 479,001,500 changes}
which, with the addition of another lever, will increafe
to 6,227,020,800. Thefe being again multiplied by
the number of changes wffiich the projedled furface of
the levers will admit in the difpofition of the notches,
their amount will exceed numeration, and may there¬
fore be properly faid to be infinite. The Aighteft in-
fpedlion will at once ffiow, that their conRrudlion pre¬
cludes all poAibility of obtaining an impreffion of their
internal parts, which is neceflary for the fabrication of
a falfe key } for it wall be ealily feen, that the poAtfdns
into w’hich the levers are forced by the preRure of the
key in opening the lock, can no more be afeertained
when the key is withdrawn, than the feal can be co¬
pied from its imprefiion on a Raid, or the courfe of a
Aiip be difeovered by tracing it on the furface of the

LOCKE, John, an eminent Englifh philofo-
pher and writer in the latter end of the 17th century,
was fon of Mr John Locke of Pensford in Someriet-
fhire, and born at Wrington near Brifiol in 1632. He
was fent to Chrifi-church in Oxford 5 but was highly
diffatisfied with the common courfe of fludies then pur-
fued in the univerfity, where nothing was taught but
the Ariflotelian philofophy •, and had a great averfion to
the difputes of the fchools then in ufe. The firfi books
which gave him a reliili for philoi'ophy were the writ¬
ings of Des Cartes; for though he did not always
approve of his notions, yet he thought he wrote with
great perfpicuity. He applied himfelf with vigour
to his fludies, particularly to phyfic, in which he
gained a confiderable knowledge, though he never
pradlifed it. In 1664, he went to Germany as fe-
cretary to Sir William Swan, envoy from the Eng¬
lifh court to the eledlor of Brandenburg and fome other
German princes. In lefs than a year, he returned to
England; where, among other fludies, he applied
himfelf to that of natural philofophy, as appears from
a regifter of the changes of the air, which he kept at
Oxford from June 24. 1666, to March 28. 1667.
'There he became acquainted with the lord Afhly,
afterwards earl of Shaftefbury, who introduced him in¬
to the converfation of fome of the moft eminent per-
fons of that time. In 1670, he began to form the
plan of his ElTay on Human Underftanding j but his
employments and avocations prevented him from finilh-
ing it then. About this time he became a member of
the Royal Society. In 1672, his patron, now earl of
Shaftefbury, and lord chancellor of England, appoint¬
ed him fecretary of the prefentations, which place
beheld till the earl refigned the great feal. In 1673,
he was made fecretary to a commiflion of trade, worth
500I. a-year; but that commiffion was diffolved in
1674. The earl of Shaftefbury being reftored to fa¬
vour, and made prefident of the council in 1679, fent
for Mr Locke to London : but that nobleman did not
continue long in his poll, being fent prifoner to the
tow^er ; and after his difcharge retired to Holland in
3682.
Mr Locke followed his patron thither. He had not
been abfent from England a year, when he was ac-
cufed at court of having written certain tra£!s againft
the government, which were afterward difcovered to be
written by another perfon ; and in November 16S4, Locke,
he was deprived cf his place of ftudent in Chrifl-
church. In x68ij, the Engliili envpy at the Hague
demanded him and 83 other perfons to be delivered up
by the Hates general: upon which he lay concealed
till the year following ; and during this time formed a
weekly afiembly with Mr Limborch, Mr Le Clerc,
and other learned men at Amfterdam. In 1689 he
returned to England in the tieet which conveyed the
princefs of Orange ; and endeavoured to procure his
reftoration to his place of Undent of Chrift-church,
that it might appear from thence that he had been un-
juftly deprived of it : but when he found the college
would admit him only as a fupernumerary fludent, he
defilled from his claim.
Being efteemed a fufferer for revolution principles,
he might eafily have obtained a more profitable poll 5
but he contented himfelf with that of commiflioner of
appeals, worth 200I. a year, which was procured for
him by the Lord Mordaunt j and about the fame time
he was offered an appointment in a diplomatic charac¬
ter, but the infirm flate of his health prevented him
from accepting it. He went afterwards to refide with
Sir Francis Mafham and his lady, at Oates in Effex,
about 25 miles from London, where he fpent moft of
his time during the reft of his life. In this agreeable
fituation he enjoyed that health and vigour which en¬
abled him to exert his talents in writing on political fub-
je£ts. Hence he appears in defence of the revolution
in one piece j and confidering the great national concern
at that time, the ill ftate of the filver coin, and propofing
remedies lor it, in others. Hence he was made a com .
miflioner of trade and plantations in 1695, which en¬
gaged him in the immediate bufinefs of the ftate ; and
with regard to the church, he publifhed a treatife the
fame year, to piomote the fcheme which King William
had much at heart, of a comprehenfion with the dif-
fenters. This, however, drew him into one contro-
verfy ; which was fcarcely ended, when he entered into
another in defence of his effay, which held till 1698 ;
foon after which the afthma, his conllitutional dif-
order, increafing with his years, began to fubdue him ;
and he became fo infirm, that in 1700 he refigned his
feat at the board of trade, becaufe he could no longer
bear the air of London fufficient for a regular attend¬
ance upon it. After this refignation he continued al¬
together at Oates; in which retirement he employed
the remaining laft years of his life entirely in the ftudy
of the Holy Scriptures.
He died in 1704, aged 73. His writings will im¬
mortalize his name. The earl of Shaftefbury, author
of the Charadleriftics, though in one place he fpeaks
of Mr Locke’s philofophy with feverity •, yet oblerves,
concerning his Effay on the Human Underftanding,
in general, “ that it may qualify men as well for bufi¬
nefs and the world, as for the faiences and the uni¬
verfity.” His Difcourfes on Government, Letters on
Toleration, and Commentaries on fome of St Paul’s
Epiftles, are alfo held in much efteem.

Log-Line, a little cord, or line, about a hundred and
fifty fathoms long, faftened to the log by means of
two legs a b (fig. 4.), one of which paffes through a ^^^GVII

while the other leg is attached to the arch by a pin
fixed into another hole, fo as to draw out occar
fionally. By thefe legs the log is hung in equilibrio ;
and the line thus annexed to it is wound round a reel
fixed for that purpofe in the gallery of the ftfip.
This line, from the diftance oi about ten, twelve,
or fifteen fathoms off the log, has certain knots or divi¬
fions, which ought to be at leaft fifty feet from each
other j though it was the common pradtice at fea no£
to have them above forty-two feet afunder.
The length of each knot ought to be the fame part
of a lea mile as half a minute is of an hour •, and ad¬
mitting the meafurement of Mr Norwood, who makes
a degree on a great circle of the earth to contain
367,200 Englilh feet, or about 69J Englith ftatute
miles, and therefore -gV^h part of it, or a nautical
mile, wall be 6120 feet 5 T~thof6i20, or 51 feet,
Ihould be length of each knot. But becaufe it is
fafer to have the reckoning rather before the ihip than
after it, therefore fifty feet may be taken as the pro¬
per length oi each knot. The knots are fometimes
made to confift only of forty-two feet each, even in the
prefent practice ; and this method of dividing the log¬
line was founded on the fuppolition that fixty miles,
each of 5000 Englilh feet, made a degree ; for ^ of
5000 is 41-f-, or, in round numbers, 42 feet. Mari¬
ners, rather than quit the old way, though known to
be erroneous, ufe glaftes for half minute ones, that run
but 24 or 25 feconds. They have alfo ufed a line of
45 feet to 30 feconds, or a glals of 28 feconds to 42
feet. When this is the cafe, the diftance between
the knots ftiould be corredied by the following pro¬
portion : as 30 is to 50 } fo is the number of feconds
or the glafs to the diftance between the knots upon
the line. The heat or moifture of the weather has of¬
ten a confiderable effedt upon the glafs, fo as to make
it run flower or fafter 5 it Ihould, therefore, be fre¬
quently tried by the pendulum-in the following man¬
ner. On a round nail hang a firing that has a muf-
ket ball fixed to one end, carefully meafuring between
the centre of the ball and the firing’s loop over the

pint. There is mention of a log, 2 Kings vi. 25
under the name of a fourth part of a cab. But in Levi¬
ticus the word log is often met with, and fignifies
that meafure of oil which lepers were to offer at the
temple after they were cured of their difeafe. Dr
Arbuthnot fays, that the log was a meafure of li¬
quids, the feventy-fecond part of the bath or ephah, and
twelfth part of the hin, according to all the accounts of
the Jewifh writers.
Log, a fea term, fignifying a fmall piece of timber a,
of a triangular, fedloral, or quadrantal figure, on board
the glafs is running out fhows the feconds it contains.
I he line alio is liable to relax and fhrink, and ftiould
therefore be occafionally meafured.
The ufe of the log and line is to keep account and
make an eftimate of the fliip’s way or diftance run ;
which is done by obferving the length of line unwound
in half a minute’s time, told by a half-minute glafs ;
for fo many knots as run out in that time, fo many
miles the {hip fails in an hour. Thus, if there be four
knots veered out in half a minute, the fhip is computed
to run four miles an hour.

The author of this advice for meafuririg the (hip’s
way is not knowrn ; and no mention of it occurs till the
year 1607, in an Eaft India voyge publiihed by Pur-
chas; but from that time its name occurs in other voy¬
ages among his colledfions ; and henceforward it be¬
came famous, being taken notice of both by our owrn
authors and by foreigners j as by Gunter in 1623 j Snel-
lius in 1624; Metius in 16315 Oughtred in 16335

To Heave the Log, as they call it, they throw it in¬
to the water on the Ice (ide, letting it run till it comes
■without the eddy of the (hip’s wake 5 then .one hold¬
ing a half-minute glafs, turns it up juft as the firft
knot, or the mark from which the knots begin to be
reckoned, turns off the reel (fig. 2.) or paffes over the
ftern. As foon as the glafs is out, the reel is (lopped,
and the knots run off are told, and their parts eftimated.
It is ufual to heave the log once every hour in (hips
of war and Eaft Indiamen, and in all other veffels1
once in two hours, allowance being made for the wind
having increafed or abated in the intervals.
The log is a very precarious way of computing,
and mull always be corrected by experience, there be¬
ing much uncertainty from the motions of the (hip, the
winds of variable force, the fridlion of the reel and light-
nefs of the log in the courfe of the current. Yet this is
a much more exa£t way of computing than any other in
ufe 5 much preferable certainly to that of the Spaniards
and Portuguefe, who gueffed at the (hip’s w^ay by the
running of the froth or water by the (hip’s fide ; or
to that of the Dutch, who ufed to heave a chip over¬
board, and to number the paces they walk on the deck
while the chip fwims between any two marks or bulk
heads on the fide.
Compound Log. The above-mentioned errors, and
particularly the log’s being fubjedl to drive with the
motion of the water at its furface, wrhereas the experi¬
ment requires it to be fixed in the place where it is
when the mark commencing the knots goes off the reel,
have been confidered, and many methods propofed to
remove or to leffen them. M. Bouguer propofed the
following method. Take for the log a conical piece of
wood, which fix to the log line paffed through or along
it* axis, at about 40, 50, or 60, or more feet,-from one
end 5 and to this end fix the diver, which is a body
formed of ttvo equal fquare pieces of tin, or of thin iron
plate, fixed at right angles to one another along their
diagonals 5 and its fize fo fitted to that of the cone,
that the whole may float. A cone of three inches
diameter in the bafe, and of fix inches in the flant
height, is propofed by M. Bouguer to fuit a diver made
of plates about 9^ inches fquare 5 the interfeftion of
the diagonals is joined to the log line, and the loop
and peg fixed as in the common log. However, it has
been found, that no kind of wood ufed in Britifh dock
yards, when formed into a cone of the above dimen-
fions, will float a diver made of (lout tin plates, one fide
of the fquare being 91 inches. Such a diver weighing
*41b. avoirdupois, required to float it a cone of five
inches diameter and twelve inches on the flant fide, fo
as the point of the cone, which was made of light fir,
fhould juft appear above the rvater. Now, fuppofing
one fide of fuch a fquare tin diver to be about ten inches,
1

and made of plates only two-thirds of the thicknefs of
the former, fuch a diver would wreigh, with its folder, '*
about 20 ounces, and can be floated by a light fir cone
of four inches diameter in the bafe, and ten inches in
the flant height or length 5 and fuch a compound log
might perhaps be found on trial to be affedted by about
as much again as that propofed by M. Bouguer 5 and
confequently the difference between the numbers
given by the common log and compound log, muft be
augmented by tvTo-thirds of itfelf for the neceffary cor-
redlion, as below. When the compound log of Bou¬
guer, above deferibed, is hove overboard, the diver
will fink too deep to be much affedled by the current
or motion of water at the furface, and the log will
thereby keep more fteadily in the place where it firft:
fell 5 and confequently the knots run off the reel
will (how more accurately the (hip’s rate of failing.
As the common log is affedled by the whole motion
of the current, fo this compound log will feel only a
part thereof, viz. fuch a part nearly as the refiftance
of the cone is to the refiftance of the diver 5 then the
refiftances of the above cone and diver are about as 1
to 5 5 and confequently this log will drive but one-
fifth part of what the common log would do 5 and fo
the (hip’s true run will be affedled by one-fifth only of
the motion of the waters. To obtain the true rate of
failing, it will be proper to heave alternately, hour and
hour, the common log, and this compound log 5 then
the difference of their knots run off, augmented by its
one-fourth part, is the correflion 5 which applied to the
knots of the common log, will give the (hip’s true rate
of failing at the middle time between the hours when
thefe logs were hove. The corredlion is additive when
the compound log’s run is the greateft, othemife it is
fubtraflive. To find the courfe made good : increafe
the obferved angle between the log lines by one-fourth
part 5 and this gives the corredlion to be applied to
the apparent courfe, or the oppofite of that (hown by
the common log 5 the corredlion is to be applied to the
{"eft} of the apparent courfe, wdien the bearing of
the common log is to the
ight } of the compound
log. Or thus : the lengths run off both logs, toge¬
ther with their bearings, being known 5 in a card or
compafs apply the knots run off, taken from a fcale
of equal parts along their refpedlive bearings from the
centre 5 join the ends 5 and in this line produced, on
the fide next the compound log’s length, take one-
fourth of the interval 5 then a line drawn from the
end, thus produced, to the centre of the card, will
(how the true courfe and diftance made good. When
a current, fuch as a tide, runs to any depth, the velo¬
city of that current may be much better afeertained by
the compound log than by the common one, provid¬
ed the diver does not defeend lower than the run of
the current 5 for as thole (hips which are deepeft im-
merged, drive faded with the tide 5 fo the diver, by
being afted on below, as well as the log on the fur¬
face, their joint motion will give the total effefl of the
current’s motion better than what could be derived
from the motion at the furface only. Alfo, by fuch a
compound log, the depth to which any current runs
may be eafily tried.

North Pole, p. 97. of two other logs, which were tried
by Captain Phipps : one invented by Mr Ruilel, the
other by Foxon j both conftru&ed upon this principle, .
that a fpiral, in proceeding its own length in the direc¬
tion of its axis through a refilling medium, makes one
revolution round the axis •, if, therefore, the revolutions
of the fpiral are regifiered, the number of times it has
gone its own length through the water will be known.
In both thefe the motion? of the fpiral in the water is
communicated to the clockwork within board, by
means of a fmall line fallened at one end to the fpiral,
which tows it after the fliip, and at the other to a
fpindle, which fets the clockwork in motion. That
invented by Mr Ruifel has a hall Ipiral of two threads,
made of copper, and a fmall dial with clockwmrk, to
regifter the number of turns of the fpiral. The other
log has a whole fpiral of wood with one thread, and a
larger piece of clockwork with three dials, two of
them to mark the dillance, and the other divided into
knots and fathoms, to (how the rate by the half mi¬
nute glafs, for the convenience of comparing it with the
log. This kind of log will have the advantage of
every other in fmooth water and moderate weather;
and "it will be ufeful in finding the trim of a ftrip
when alone, in furveying a coaft in a Angle Ihip, or in
meafuring diltances in a boat between headlands and
flroals ; but it is fubject to other inconveniences, which
will not render it a proper fubfiitute for the common
log.
Perpetual Log, a machine fo called by its inventor,
Mr Gottlieb of London, is intended for keeping a con-
ft&nt and regular account of the rate of a drip’s velocity
in the interval of heaving the log.

{hip’s figure. EF are the feftion of a wmoden external
cafe, left open at the ends KL, to admit the paflage
of the water during the motion of the drip. At M is
a copper grating, placed to obdruft the entrance of
any dirt, See. into the machine. I is a feftion of a
water wheel, made from 6 to 12 inches in diameter, as
may be neceffary, with doatboards upon its circumfer¬
ence, like a common water w'heel, that turn by the
refidance of the water pading through the channel
LK. It turns upon a drouldered axis, reprefented by
the vertical feflion at K. When the drip is in motion,
the refidance of the wrater through the channel LK
turns round the wheel I. This wheel, by means of a
pinion, is conne£!ed with and turns the rod contained ^
in the long copper tube N. This rod, by a pinion
fixed at its upper extremity, is connected with and
turns upon the wdrole fydein of wheels contained in
the dial of the cafe ABCD. This dial, by means of
the copper tube N, may be fixed to any convenient
place aboard the drip. In the front of the dial are
feveral ufeful circular graduations, as follow : Fire re¬
ference by the dotted line A has a hand which is
moved by the wheels within, which points out the mo¬
tion of the drip in fathoms of 6 feet each, 'the circle
at B has a hand {bowing the knots, at the rate of 48
feet for each knot : and is to be obferved with the half-
minute glafs at any time. The circle at C has a drort
and a long hand ; the former of which points out the
miles in land meafure, and the latter or longer the
number of knots contained in each mile, viz. 128,
which is in the fame proportion to a mile as 60 minutes,
to the hour in the reckoning. At c, a fmall portion of
a circle is feen through the front plate called the re^ijicrp
which drows, in the courfe of 24 hours (if the diip is
upon one tack), the didance in miles that die has run ;
and in the 24 hours the mariner need take but one
obfervation, as this regider ferves as an ufeful check
upon the fathoms, knots, and miles, diown upon the
two other circles.
/ Is a plate diowang 100 degrees or 6000 miles,
and alfo a£ts as another regider or check ; and is ufe¬
ful in cafe of any miftake being made in obferving the
didance run by the other circles. The reckoning by
thefe circles, without fear of midake, may therefore
be continued to nearly 1 2,000 miles.
A communication from this machine may eadly be
made to the captain’s bedfide, where by touching a
fpring only, a bell in the head ABCD will found as
many times in a half minute as the drip fails miles in an
hour.

LOGARITHMS-
INTRODUCTION.
THE labour and time required for performing the
arithmetical operations of multiplication, dividon,
and the extraftlon of roots, were at one time condder-
able obdacles to the improvement of various branches
of knowledge, and in particular the fcience of adro-
nomy. But about the end of the 16th century, and
the beginning of the 17th, feveral mathematicians be-^
gan to confider by whet means they might fimplify thefe
operations, or fubditute for them others more eafily
performed. Their efforts produced fome ingenious con¬
trivances for abridging calculations ; but of thefe the
mod complete by far wTas that of John Napier Baron of
Merchifton in Scotland, wiho invented a fyftem of num¬
bers called logarithms, which were fo adapted to the
numbers to be multiplied, or divided, that thefe being
arranged in the form of a table, each oppofite to the
number
6^
logarithms.
Introduc- number called its logarithm, the product of any two
tion. ^ numbers in the table was found by the addition of their
'logarithms; and, on the contrary, the quotient arifing
from the divifion of one number by another was found
by the fubtradtion of the logarithm of the divifor from
that of the dividend ; and fimllar Amplifications took
place in the flill more laborious operations of involu¬
tion and evolution. But before we proceed to relate
more particularly the circumftances of this invention,
it will be proper to give a general view of the nature
of logarithms, and of the circumftances which render
them of ufe in calculation.
Let there be formed two feries of numbers, the one
conftituting a geometrical progreflion, the hrft term of
which is unity or I, and the common ratio any num¬
ber whatever, and the other an arithmetical progreftion,
the firft term of which is o, and the common difference
alfo any number whatever ; (but as a particular ex¬
ample we (hall fuppofe the common ratio of the geome¬
trical feries to be 2, and the common difference of the
arithmetical feries I), and let the two feries be written
oppofite to each other in the form of a table, thus:

&c.
The two feries being thus arranged, the terms in
the arithmetical feries are called the logarithms of the
correfponding terms of the geometrical feries; that
is, o is the logarithm of 1, and 1 is the logarithm
of 2, and 2 is the logarithm of 4, and 3 that of 8,
and fo on.
From the manner in which the two feries are related
to each other, it will readily appear by indu&ion that
the logarithms of the terms of the geometrical feries
have the two following properties:
I. The fum of the logarithms of any two numbers
or terms in the geometrical feries is equal to the loga¬
rithm of that number, or term of the feries, which is
equal to their produft.
For example, let the terras of the geometrical feries
be 4 and 3 2 ; the terms of the arithmetical feries cor¬
refponding to them (that is, their logarithms) are 2
and 5 ; now the produff of the numbers is 1 28, and the
fum of their logarithms is 7 ; and it appears by infpec-
tion of the two leries, that the latter number is the
logarithm of toe former, agreeing with the propofition
we are iliuftrating. In like manner, if the numbers or
terms of the geometrical feries be 16 and 64, the lo¬
garithms of which are 4 and 6, we find from the table
that icrrp-f6 is the logarithm of 1024—16x64;
and fo of any other numbers in the table.
2. The difference of the logaiithms of any two num- Introduc”
bers, or term* of the geometrical feries, is equal to the tlon-
logarithm of that term of the feries which is equal to
the quotient arifing from the divifion of the one number
by the other.
Take for example the terms 128 and 32, the lo¬
garithms of which are 7 and 5 ; the greater of thefe
numbers divided by the lefs is 4, and the difference of
their logarithms is 2 ; and by inipe&ing the two feries,
this laft number will be found to be the logarithm
of the former. In like manner, if the terms of the
geometrical feries be 1024 and 16, the logarithms
of which are 10 and 4, we find that 1024-^-16=64,
and that 10—4 = 6;^ now it appears from the table
that the latter number, viz. 6, is the logarithm of the
former 64.
Thefe two properties of logarithms, the fecond of
which indeed is an immediate confequence of the firft,
enable us to find with great facility the product or
the quotient of any tvx> terms of a geometrical feries
to which there is adapted an arithmetical feries, fo that
each number has its logarithm oppofite to it, as in the
preceding ftiort table. For it is evident, that to mul¬
tiply twro numbers wTe have only to add their loga¬
rithms, and oppofite to that logarithm which is the fum
we fhall find the produfl required. Thus, to mul¬
tiply 16 by 128; to the logarithm of 16, which is
4, we add the logarithm of 128, which is 7, and op¬
pofite to the fum 11, w’e find 2048, the produdl fought.
On the other hand, to divide any number in the table
by any other number, we muft fubtraft the logarithm
of the divifor from that of the dividend, and look for
the remainder among the logarithms, and oppofite to
it we (hall find the number fought. Thus, to di¬
vide 2048 by 128, from 11, which is the logarithm
of 2048 we fubtraft 7, the logarithm of 128, and
oppofite to the remainder 4 we find 16, the quotient
fought.
Let us now fuppofe any number of geometrical means
to be interpofed between each two adjoining terms of
the preceding geometrical feries, and the fame number
of arithmetical means between every two adjoining
terms of the arithmetical feries ; then, as the refults will
ftill be a geometrical and an arithmetical feries, the in¬
terpolated terms of the latter will be the logarithms of
the correfponding terms of the former, and the two new
feries will have the very fame properties as the original
feries.
If we fuppofe the number of interpolated means to
be very great, it will follow that among the terms of
the refulting geometrical feries, fome one or other will
be found nearly equal to any propofed number what¬
ever. Therefore, although the preceding table exhi¬
bits the logaiithms of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, &c. but does
not contain the logarithms of the intermediate num¬
bers, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, &c. yet it is eafy to conceive
that a table might be formed by interpolation which
ftiould contain, among the terms of the geometrical fe¬
ries, all numbers whatever to a certain extent, (or at leaft
others very neaily equal to them) together with their
logarithms. If fuch a table were conftrudled, or at
leaft if fuch terms of the geometrical progreflion were
found together with their logarithms, as were either
accurately equal to, or coincided nearly with, all num¬
bers

Introcluc- bers witbin certain limits, (for example between I and
, tl0n- iooooo) then, as often as we had occafion to multiply
v"" '' or divide any numbers contained in that table we might
evidently obtain the produfts or quotients by the Am¬
ple operations of addition and fubtra&ion.
The firft invention of logarithms has been attributed
by fbme to Longomontanus, and by others to Jufte Byrgey
two mathematicians who were cotemporary with Lord
Napier; but there is no reafon to fuppofe thi/t either of
thefe anticipated him, for Longomontanus never publilh-
ed any thing on the fubjeft, although he lived thirty-
three years after Napier had made known his difeovery;
and as to Byrgey he is indeed known to have printed a
table containing an arithmetical and a geometrical pro-
greffion written oppofite to each other$. ib as to form in
effect a fyftem of logarithms of the fatne kind as thofe
invented by Napier, without however explaining their
nature and ufe, although it appears from the title he
intended to do fo, but was probably prevented by fome
caufe unknown to us. But this work was not printed
till 1620, fix years after Napier had publilhed his dif¬
eovery.
It is therefore with good reafon that Napier is now
univerfally confidered as the firft, and moft probably as
the only inventor. This difeovery he publilhed in the
year 1614 in a book entitled Mirijici Logarithmorum
Canonis Defcriptio, but he referved the conftru&ion of
the numbers till the opinion of the learned concerning
his invention fhould be known. His work contains a
table of the natural fines and cofines, and their loga¬
rithms for every minute of the quadrant, as alfo the
differences between the logarithmic fines and cofines,
which are in effedl the logarithmic tangents. There is
no table of the logarithms of numbers $ but precepts are
given, by which they, as well as the logarithmic tan¬
gents, may be found from the table of natural and lo¬
garithmic fines.
In explaining the nature of logarithms, Napier fup-
pofes feme determinate line which reprefents the radius
of a circle to be continually diminifhed, fo as to have
fucceflively all poflible values, and thus to be equal
to every fine, one after another, throughout the qua¬
drant. And he fuppofes this diminution to be effected
by a point moving from one extremity towards the other
extremity, (or rather fome point very near it), with a mo¬
tion that is not uniform, but becomes flotver and flower,
and fuch, that if the whole time between the beginning
and the end of the motion be conceived to be divided
into a very great number of equal portions, the decre¬
ments taken away in each of thefe fhall be to one ano¬
ther as the refpeftive remainders of the line. Accord¬
ing to this mode of conceiving the line to decreafe, it is
eafy to (hew that at the end of any fucceffive equal in¬
tervals of time from the beginning of the motion, the
portions of the line which remain will conftitute a de-
creafing geometrical progreflion.
Again, he fuppofes another line to be generated by
a point which moves along it equably, or which paffes
over equal intervals of it in equal times. Thus the por¬
tions of the line generated at the end of any equal fuc-
ceflive intervals of time from the beginning of the mo¬
tion will form a feries of quantities in arithmetical pro¬
greflion, Now if the two motions be fuppofed to be¬
gin together, at the end of any equal intervals of time
the remainders of the one line will form a feries of
Vou XH. Part J.
I T H M S. 65
quantities in geometrical progrtflion, and the corref- Introduc-
ponding portions generated of the other line, will con-, tlon' ,
ftitute a feries in arithmetical progreflion, fo that the
latter will be the logarithms of the former. And as
the terms of the geometrical progreflion decreafe con¬
tinually from radius, which is the greateft term, to o,
while the terms of the correfponding arithmetical pro¬
greflion increafe from o upwards, according to Napier’s
lyftem the logarithm of radius is o, and the logarithms
of the fines from radius down to o, are a feiies of
numbers increafing from o to infinite.
The velocities or degrees of quicknefs with which
the motions commence may have to each other any ratio
whatever, and by affuming different ratios we lhall
have different fyftems of logarithms. Napier ftippofed.
the velocities to be equal; but the fyftem of logarithms
produced in confequence of this affumption having been
found to have fome difadvantages, it has been long dif-
ufed, and a more convenient one fubftituted inftead of
it, as we fhall prefently have occafion to explain.
Napier’s work having been written in Latin was
tranflated into EnglUh by Mr Edivard Wright, an in¬
genious mathematician of that period, and the inventor
of the principles of what is commonly though errone-
oully called Mercator's failing. The translation was
fent to Napier for his perufal, and returned with his
approbation, and the addition of a few lines, intimating
that he intended to make fome alteration in the fyftem
of logarithms in a fecond edition. Mr Wright died
foan after be received back his tranflation ; but it was
publhhed after his death, in the year 1616, accom¬
panied with a dedication by his fon to the Eaft India
Company, and a preface by Henry Briggs, who after¬
wards diftinguifhed himfelf fo much by his improvement
of logarithms. Mr Briggs likewife gave in this work
the defeription and draught of a fcale which had been
invented by Wright, as alfo various methods of his own
for finding the logarithms of numbers, and the contrary,
by means of Napier’s table, the ufe of which had been
attended with fome inconvenience on account of its con¬
taining only fuch numbers as were the natural fines ta
every minute of the quadrant and their logarithms.
There W’as an additional inconvenience in ufing the
table, arifing from the logarithms being partly pofitive
and partly negative ; the latter of thefe was, however,
well remedied by John Speidell in his New Logarithms,
firft publilhcd in the year 1-619, contained the
fines, cofines, tangents, cotangents, fecants, and cofe-
cants, and given in fuch a form as to be all pofitive ;
and the former was ftill more completely removed by an
additional table, which he gave in the fixth impreffion
of his work, in the year 1624, and which contained the
logarithms of the whole numbers 1,2, 3, 4, &c. to
1000, together with their differences and arithmetical
complements, &c. This table is now commonly call¬
ed hyperbolic logarithms, bccaufe the numbers ferve to
exprefs the areas contained between a hyperbola and
its afymptote, and limited by ordinates drawn parallel
to the other afymptote. This name, however, is cer¬
tainly improper, as the fame fpaces may reprefent the
logarithms of any fyftem whatever, (fee Fluxions.
$152. Ex. 5.)
In 1719 Robert Napier, fon of the inventor of lo¬
garithms, publiihed a fecond edition of his father’s
Logarithmorum Canonis Defcriptio. And along with
I this
/
L O G A R
- this the promifed Logarithmofum Canonis CotiJlruBio,
l and other pieces written bj his father and Mr Briggs.
An exafl copy of the fame two works in one volume
was alfo printed in 1620 at Lyons in France. In 1618
or 1619 Benjamin Urjinus, mathematician to the elector
of Brandenburg, publiilied Napier’s tables of logarithms
in his Curfus Mathematicus, to which he added feme
tables of proportional parts j and in 1624 he printed
his Trigonometric, with a table of natural fines,aand their
logarithms of the Napierean kind andfc>rm, to every ten
feconds of the quadrant.
In the fame year, 1624, the celebrated John Kepler
publiihed at Marpurg logarithms of nearly the fame
kind, under the title of Chilias Logarithmorum ad to-
tidem Numeros Rotundas, prcemijfa Demonjlratione ligi-
tima Ortus Logarithmorum eorumque Ufus, &c. and in
the following year he publilhed a fupplement to this
work. In the preface to this laft he fays, that feveral
of the profeflbrs of mathematics in Upper Germany,
and more efpecially thofe of them who were fomewhat
advanced in years, and were grown averfe to new me¬
thods of reafoning that carried them out of the old doc¬
trines and principles with which habit had rendered
them familiar, doubted in fome degree whether Napier’s
demon ft ration of the property of logarithms was perfect¬
ly true, and whether the application of them to trigo-
nometrical calculations might not be unfafe and lead
the calculator who ftrould truft in them to erroneous
refults 5 and in either cafe, whether the do&rine w'ere
true or not, they confidered Napier’s demon ftration of
it as illegitimate and unfatisfaclory This opinion in¬
duced Kepler to compofe the above-mentioned work, in
which the whole doftrine is treated in a manner ftriftly
geometrical, and free from the confiderations of motion
which the German mathematicians had objected to
(and not wuthout reafon) in Napier’s mode of treating
the fubjeci.
On the publication of Napier’s logarithms, Mr Henry
Briggs, fome time profeffor of geometry in Greiham
college London, and aftemards Savilian profeffor of
geometry at Oxford (whom we have already mentioned)
applied himfelf with great earneftnefs to their ftudy and
improvement, and it appears that he had projedted at
an early period that advantageous change in the fyftem
which has fince taken place. From the particular view
which Napier took of the fubjedf, and the manner in
which he conceived logarithms to be generated, it hap¬
pened that in his fyftem, the logarithms of a feries of
numbers which increafed in a decuple ratio, (as 1,10,
J 00, 1000, &c.) formed adecreafing arithmetical feries,
the common difference of the terms of which was
-•320585r* But it occurred to Briggs that it would
be oe;.ter and more conformable to the received deci¬
mal notation, to adopt a fyftem in which the logarithms
of the terms of fuch a geometrical feries fhould differ
froin each other by unity or 1. This idea Briggs com¬
municated to the public in his ledfures, and alfo to
Napier himfelf. He even went twice to Edinburgh to
fee him, and to converfe with him upon the fubiedt ■
and on his firft vifit Napier faid that he had alfo form¬
erly thought, of the fame improvement, but that he
chofe to publifh the logarithms he.had previoufly cal¬
culated, till fuch time as his health and convenience
would allow him to make others more commodious.
And whereas in the change which Briggs propofedj it
I T H M 8.
was intended to make the logarithms of the fines to in- Introduc-
creafe from o (the logarithm of radius) to infinity, t’ori-
while the fines themfelves fhould decreafe, it was fuo- v~"““
gefted to him by Napier that it would be better to
make them increafe fo that o, inftead of being the lo¬
garithm of radius, ftiould be the logarithm of°1 ; and
that 100000, &c. fhould be the logarithm of radius ;
and this Bfiggs admitted would be an improvement ; .
and having changed the numbers he had already cal¬
culated lo as to make them fuit Napier’s modification
of his plan, he returned with them next year to Edin¬
burgh, and fubmitted them to his perufal.
It appears therefore that Briggs was the inventor of
this improved fyftem of logarithms which has fince
been univerfally adopted, and that the only ftiare that
Napier had in it w’as his fuggefting to Briggs to begin
with the lovy number 1, and to make the logarithms,
or the artificial numbers, as Napier had always called
them, to increafe with the natural numbers, inftead of
decreafing, w hich made no alteration in the figures, but
only in their affedlions or figns, changing them from
negative to pofitive.
On Briggs’s return from Edinburgh, in 1617, he
printed the firft thoufand logarithms to eight places of.
figures, befides the index, with the title of Logarithmo¬
rum Chilias prime; but thefe feem not to have been
pubhftied till after the death of Napier, which happen¬
ed in 1618, for in his preface he expreifes a hope, that
the circumftances which led to a change in the fyftem
would be^explained in Napier’s pollhumous work, which
was prefently to appear. But although Napier had in¬
timated in a note he had given in Wright’s tranflation
of the Canon Mirificus, as wxdl as his Rabdolcgia, print¬
ed in 1617, that he intended to alter the fcale, yet he
altogether omits to ftate that Briggs either w as the firft
to think of this improvement, or at leaft to publifh it
to the w’orld. And as the fame filence on this point
was obferved in Napier’s pofthumous work publilhed
in 1619 by his fon, Briggs took occafion in the preface
to his Arithmetica Lagarithmica to affert his claims to the
improvement he had nowr carried into execution.
The ftudied filence which Napier feems to have ob¬
ferved refpedfing the improvement of the fyftem, which
Briggs had communicated to him, has given juft reafon
to fufpeft that he wifhed to be confidered as the author
of that improvement, as wTell as the original inventor.
But although it is poffible that he thought of it as foon
as Briggs, it would feem to have been no more than
juftice, if, when announcing his intended change of the
fcale, he had acknowledged that the fame idea had oc¬
curred to Briggs as well as to himielf.
In 1620 Mr Edmund Gunter publiflied his Canon of
Triangles, which contains the artificial or logarithmic
fines and tangents to every minute to feven places of fi¬
gures befides the index, the logarithm of radius being
10. Thefe logarithms are of the kind which had been
agreed upon between Napier and Briggs, and they w'ere
the firft tables of logarithmic fines and tangents that
were publiftied of this fort. Gunter alio in 1623 re¬
printed the fame in his book de SeBore et Radio, toge¬
ther with the Chilias pnma of Briggs j and in the fame
year he applied the logarithms of numbers, fines, and
tangents, to ftraight lines drawn upon a ruler. This
inftrument is now in common ufe for navigation and o-
ther purpofes, and is commonly called Gunter's fcale.
The

Ifttfoduc- The difcoveries In Logarithms were firft carried to
tion. Trance by Mr Edmund Wingate, but not firft of all as
•—""v ' he fays in the preface to his book. He publiftied at
Paris in 1624 two fmall trafts in the French language
upon logarithms, and thefe were reprinted with improve¬
ments at London in 1626. > _ .
In the year 1624, Briggs publifhed his Arithmetica
Logarithmica, a ftupendous work confidering the fhort
time he had been in preparing it. He here gives the
logarithms of 30000 natural numbers to fourteen places
of figures, befides the index •, namely, from 1 to 20000,
and from 90000 to looooo, together with the difte-
rences of the logarithms. He alio gives an ample trea-
tife on their conftruaion and ufe, and he earneftly foli-
cits others to undertake the computation of the interme¬
diate numbers, offering to give inftru&ions, and. paper
ready ruled for that purpofe, to any perfons inclined to
contribute to the completion of fo valuable a work. By
this invitation he had hopes of collefting mateiials for
the logarithms of the intermediate *jooco numbers,
while he Ihould employ his time upon the Canon of Lo¬
garithmic fines and tangents, and fo carry on both works
at once.
Soon after this, Adrian Vlacq or Elack of Gouda m
Holland completed the intermediate 70 chiliads, and
republilhed the Amthnietica Logarithmic a in 1627 and
16 28, with thefe intermediate numbers, making in all,
the logarithms of all numbers to 100,000, but only to
10 places of figures. To thefe was added a table of ar¬
tificial fines, tangents, and fecants, to every minute of the
quadrant.
Briggs himfelf lived alfo to complete a table of lo¬
garithmic fines and tangents, to the 100th part of every
degree, to fourteen plates of figures befides the index,
together with a table of natural fines to the fame parts
to fifteen places, and the tangents and fecants of the
fame to ten places, with the conftruftion of the whole.
But his death, wdiich then happened, prevented him
from completing the application and ufes of them.
However, when dying, he Committed the performing
of this office to his friend Henry Gellihrand, who ac¬
cordingly added a preface, and the application of the
logarithms to plane and fpherical trigonometry. 1 he
work was called Trigonometria Britannic a, and was
printed at Gouda in the year 1633 under the care of
Adrian Vlack.
In the fame year, 1633, Adrian Vlach printed a
work of his own, called Trigonometria Artijicialis, Jive
Magnus Canon Triangulorum Logarithmicus ad Decadas
Secundorum Scrupulorum Conjlrudius. This work con¬
tains the logarithmic fines and tangents to 10 places of
figures, with their differences for every 10 feconds in
the quadrant. It alfo contains Briggs’s table of the
firft 20000 logarithms to ten places, befides the index,
with their differences •, and to the rvhole is prefixed a
defcription of the tables and their applications, chiefly
extracted from Briggs’s Trigonometria Britannic a, which
we have already mentioned.
Gellibrand publifhed alfo, in 1635, An Injiitution
Trigonometrical, containing the logarithms of the firft
J0,000 numbers, wdth the natural fines, tangents, and
fecants, and the logarithmic fines and tangents for de-
grees-and minutes j all to leven places of figures befides
the index.

The writers, wdiofe works we nave hitherto noticed, Intreduc-
were for the moft part computers of logarithms. But 1 __ ^ 1
the fyftem beft adapted to practice being now7 w’ell af-
certained, and the labour of conftrucling the table ac-
complifhed, fucceeding writers on the fubjeft have had
little more to do than to give the tables in the moft
convenient form. It is true that, in confequence of
the numerous difcoveries which were afterwards made
in mathematics, particularly in the dodfrine of feries,
great improvements were made in the method of com¬
puting logarithms •, but thefe, for the moft part, came
too late to be of ufe in the adtual conftrudtion of the
table, although they might be applied wflth advantage
to verify calculations previoufly performed by methoas
much more laborious.
As it is of importance that fuch as have occafion to
employ logarithms ftiould know what wTorks are held in
eftimation on account of their extent and accuracy, wre
fhall enumerate the following.
1. Sherwin’s Mathematical Tables, in 8vo. Thefe
contain the logarithms of ail numbers to ici,oooj and
the fines, tangents, fecants, and verfed fines, both na¬
tural and logarithmic, to every minute of the quadrant.
The third edition, printed in I742> which w\*s revifed
by Gardiner, is efteemed the moft correct j but, in the
fifth edition, the errors are fo numerous, that no de¬
pendence can be placed upon it when accuracy is re¬
quired.
2. Gardiner’s Tables of Logarithms for all numbers
to 101,000, and for the fines and tangents to every ten
feconds of the quadrant 5 alfo for the fines of the firft
72 minutes to every fingle fecond, &c. This wTork,
which is in 410, was printed in I742> anc^ **
high eftimation for its accuracy.
3. An edition of the fame work, with fome additions,
printed in 1770 in Avignon in France. The tables in
both editions are to feven places of figures.
4. Tables Portatives de Logarithmes, publiee a Lon-
dres, par Gardiner, augmentdes et perfeclionecs dans
leur difpojition, par M. Collet.—Th'.s work is moft
beautifully printed in a fmall oftavo volume, and con¬
tains all the tables in Gardiner’s quarto volume j with
fome additions and improvements.
5. Dr Hutton’s Mathematical Tables, containing
common hyperbolic and logiftic logarithms, &c.— I his
w7ork has paffed through feveral editions, under the
care of the learned author : it is perhaps the moft com¬
mon of any in this country, and is defervedly held in
the higheft eftimation, both on account of its accuracy,
and the very valuable information it contains refpedting
the hiftory of logarithms, and other branches of mathe¬
matics connefted with them.
6. Taylor’s Table of Logarithmic Sines and Tangents
to every fecond of the quadrantto which is prefixed
a table of logarithms from 1 to 100,000, &c.— 1 his is
a moft valuable work •, but being a very large quarto
volume, and alfo very expenfive, it is lefs adapted to
general ufe than- the preceding, which is an o£tavo,
and may be had at a moderate price.

with Prieur de la Cote d'Or, and Brunei de Montpelier,
about the beginning of the French revolution. This

lowing tables.
1. The natural fines for each 10,000th part of the

to be pmblifhed with twenty-two decimals and five co¬

the arcs calculated like thcfe of the third article.

7. The logarithms of numbers from 100,000 to
200,000, calculated to 24 decimals, in order to be pub-
Ilfhed to 12 decimals and three columns of differences.
The printing of this work was begun at the expence
of the French government, but was fufpended at the
fall of the aflignats •, whether it has been fmce refumed
we cannot pofitively fay, but it certainly is not yet
completed.
SECT. I.
jQF THE NATURE OF LOGARITHMS AND
THEIR CONSTRUCTION.
WE have already ftiewn that the properties of loga¬
rithms are deducible from thofe of two feries, the terms
of one of which form a geometrical progreffion, and thofe
of the other an arithmetical progreffion 5 and as this
manner of treating the fubjefl is fimple, it is perhaps
the beft adapted of any to fuch of our readers as have
not purfued the ftudy of mathematics to any great ex¬
tent We fhall now (hew how, from the fame princi¬
ples, the logarithm of any propofed number whatever
may be found.
The firft flep to be taken in conftrufling a fyffem of
logarithms is to affume the logarithm of fome determi¬
nate number, befides that of unity or 1, which muff ne-
ceffaiily be o. From the particular view which Napier
took of the fubjeft, he was led to affume unity for the
logarithm of the number 2.718282, by which it hap-
I T H M S.
pened that the logarithm of 1 0 was 2.302585, and tiffs Nature of
affumption being made, the form of the fyffem became Logantfinaa,
determinate, and the logarithm of every number fixed ^c'
to one particular value.
Mr Briggs however obferved, that it would be bet¬
ter to affume unity for the logarithm of ic, inftead of
making it the logarithm of 2.718282, as in Napier’s
fyftem, and hence the logarithms of the terms of the
geometrical piogreflion
I, 10, ICO, IOOO, IOOOO, &c.
were neceffarily fixed to the corefponding terms of this
arithmetical progreflion,
o, I, 2, 3, 4, &.c.
That is, the logarithm of 1 being o, and that of 10
being j, the logarithm of 100 is 2, and that of 1000
is 3, and fo on.
The logarithms of the terms of the progreflion, 1,10,
IOO, loco, &c. being thus determined j in order to
form the logarithms of the numbers between 1 and 10,
and between 10, and ico, and fo on, we muff conceive
a very great number of geometrical means to be inter-
pofed between each two adjoining terms of the prece-
ding geometrical feries, and as many arithmetical means
between the correfponding terms of the arithmetical fe¬
ries ; then, like as the terms of the arithmetical leries
o, I, 2, 3, &c. are the logarithms of the correfponding
terms of the geometrical feries 1, 10, 100, 1000, &c.
the interpolated terms of the former will alfo be the1 lo¬
garithms of the correfponding interpolated terms of the
latter. Now as by fuppofing the number of means in-
terpofed between each two terms of the geometrical fe¬
ries to be fufficiently gfeat, fome one or other of them,
may be found which will be very nearly equal to any
propofed number j it is evident that to find the lo¬
garithm of fuch a number, we have only to feek for one
of the interpolated means which is very nearly equal to
it, and to take- the logarithm of that mean as a near
value of the logarithm required.
As a particular example, let it be required to find
the logarithm of the number 5, according to Briggs’s
fyftem.
Fir/l fep of the procefs.—‘The number 5 is between
I and 10, the logarithms of which rve already know
to be o and 1 : Let a geometrical mean be found be¬
tween the two former, and an arithmetical mean be¬
tween the two latter. The geometrical mean will be
the fquare root of the product of the numbers 1 and
10, which is 3.162277 •, and the arithmetical mean
will be half the firm of the logarithms O and 1, which
is 0.5; therefore the logarithm of 3.162277 is o.?.
But as the mean thus found is not fufficiently near to
the propofed number, we muff: proceed with the opera¬
tion as follows:
Second fep.—The number 5, whofe logarithm is
fought is between 3.162277, the mean laft found, and
10, the logarithms of which we know to be 0.5 and
I j we muff now find a geometrical mean between the
two former, and an arithmetical mean between the
two latter. The one of thefe is v/(3-I62277 X 10)
= 5.623413, aijd the other is
1 +0.t_
0.75
there¬
fore the logarithm of 5.623413 is 0.75.
ThirdyA/>.—We have now obtained two numbers,
namely
L O G A R
Nature of namely 3.162277 and 5.623413, one on each fide of
logarithms,^ together with their logarithms 0.5 and .075, we
. ^~c~ therefore proceed exaftly as before, and accordingly we
v ' find the geometrical mean, or ^(3.162277x5.623413),
to be 4.216964, and the arithmetical mean, or -
2
to be 0.625 j therefore the logarithm of 4.216964 is
0.625.
Fourth flep,—We proceed in the fame manner with
the numbers 4.216964, and 5.623413 (one of which
is lefs, and the other greater than 5) and their loga¬
rithms 0.625 and 0.75, and find a new geometrical
mean, viz. 4.869674, and its correfponding arithmeti¬
cal mean, or logarithm, 0.6875.
We muft go on in this way till we have found twen¬
ty-two geometrical means, and as many correfponding
arithmetical means or logarithms. And that wTe may
indicate how thefe are found from each other, let the
numbers 1 and to be denoted by A and B, and their
geometrical means taken in their order by C, D, E,

As the laft of thefe means, viz. Z, agrees with 5, the
propofed number, as far at leaft as the fixth place of de¬
cimals, we may fafely confider them as very nearly equal,
therefore their logarithms will alfo be very nearly equal,
that is the logarithm of 5 will be b 6989700 nearly.
In performing the operations indicated in the prece¬
ding table it will be neceflary to find the geometrical
means at the beginning to many more figures than are
here put down, in order to obtain at laft a refult true
to 7 decimal places. Thus it appears that the labour
of computing logarithms by this method is indeed very
great. It is, however, that which was employed by
Briggs and Vlacq in the original conftruflion of loga¬
rithms 5 but fince the period in which they lived, others
more eafy have been found, as we {hall prefently have
occafion to explain.
The logarithm of any number whatever may be
I T H M S. 69
found by a feries of calculations fimilar to that which Nature of
we have juft now explained. But in conftru£ling the
table it rvould only be neceffary to have recourfe to this , , ^. 1
method in calculating the logarithms of prime num¬
bers ; for as often as the logarithm of a number which
was the produft of other numbers, whofe logarithms
were known, was required, it would be immediately
obtained by adding together the logarithms of its fac¬
tors. On the contrary, if the logarithm of the produfl
of tw’o numbers were known, and alfo that of erne of
its fadlors, the logarithm of the other faflor would
be obtained from thefe, by limply taking their difference.
From this laft remark it is obvious, that having now
found the logarithm of 5, we can immediately find that
of 2; for fince 2 is the quotient of 10 divided by 5,
its logarithm wall be the difference of the logarithms
of 10 and 5 *, now the logarithm of 10 is 1, and the
logarithm of 5 is 0.6989700, therefore the logarithm
of 2180.3010300.
Having thus obtained the logarithms of 2 and 5, in
addition to thofe of 10, 100, 1000, &c. we may thence
find the logarithms of innumerable other numbers.
Thus, becaufe 4=r 2X2, the logarithm of 4 will be the
logarithm of 2 added to itfelf, or wall be twice the lo¬
garithm of 2. Again, becaufe 5 x 10=150, the loga¬
rithm of 50 will be the fum of the logarithms of 5 and w
10. In this manner it is evident we may find the lo¬
garithms of 8=2x4, 16=2x8, of 25=5x5, and
of as many more fuch numbers as wTe pleafe.
Befides the view w'e have hitherto taken of the theo¬
ry of logarithms, there are others under which it has
been prefented by different authors. Some of thefe we
proceed to explain, beginning with that in which they
are defined to be the tneafures of ratios; but to fee the
propriety of this definition, it muft be underftood what
is meant by the meafure of a ratio.
According to the definition of a compound ratio, as
laid down by writers on geometry, it there be any num¬
ber of magnitudes A, B, C, D, which are continual
proportionals, or fuch that the ratio of A to B is equal
to the ratio of B to C, and that again is equal
to the ratio of C to D, and fo on, the ratio of the firft
of thefe magnitudes A to the third C is confidered as
made up of two equal ratios, each equal to the ratio of
the firft A to the fecond B. And in like manner the
ratio of the firft A to the fourth D is confidered as
made up of three equal ratios, each equal to the ratio
of the firft to the fecond, and fo on. (See Geometry
Se<ft. III. Def. 10, 11, and 12.) Thus, to take a par¬
ticular example in numbers, becaufe the ratio of 81 to
3 may be confidered as made up of the ratio of 81 to
27, and of 27 to 9, and of 9 to 3, which three ratios
are equal among themfelves, (Geometry Se£f. III.
Def. 4.) the ratio of 8r to 3 will be triple the ratio of
9 to 3 ; and in like manner the ratio of 27 to 3 will
be double the ratio of 9 to 3. Alfo, becaufe the ratios
of 1000 to 100, 100 to 10, 10 to 1, are all equal, the
ratio of 1000 to 1 will be three times as great as the
ratio of 10 to 1 j and the ratio of too to 1 will be
twice as great; and fo on.
Taking this view of ratios, and confidering them as
a particular fpecies of quantities, made up or others of
the fame kind, they may evidently be compared with
each other, in refpeft of their magnitudes, in the fame
manner as we compare lines or quantities of any kind
whatever...
L O G A R
of whatever. And as when eftirnating the relative mag-
nitudes of two quantities, two lines for example, if
we find that the one contains five fuch equal parts as
the other contains feven, we fay the one line has to the
other the proportion of 5 to 7 j fo, in like manner, if two
ratios be fuch, that the one can be refolved into five
equal ratios, and the other into feven of the fame ratios,
we may conclude that the magnitude of the one ratio
is to that of the other as the number 5 to the number
7 ; and a fimilar conclufion may be drawn, when the
ratios to be compared are any multiples whatever of
fome other ratio.
It is well known that there may be lines and other
quantities, which, as they admit of no common meafure,
are faid to be incommenfurable to each other ; and the
fame will alfo happen to ratios: That is, there may be
two ratios fuch that into whatever number of equal ra¬
tios the one is divided, the other cannot poffibly be ex¬
actly equal to a ratio compofed of any number of thefe.
We may however conceive the number of equal ratios
into which the one is divided to be fo great that a cer¬
tain number of them (hall compofe a ratio more nearly
equal to the other ratio than by any affignable diffe¬
rence. Therefore, like as we can always find numbers
which fhall have among themfelves, either accurately,
©r as nearly as we pleafe, the fame ratios as any num¬
ber of lines or other magnitudes have to each other,
and which therefore may be taken as the meafures, or
reprefentatives of the lines; fo alfo, correfponding to
any fyflem of ratios, there may be always found a feries
of numbers which will have the fame proportions a-
mong themfelves as the ratios have to each other, and
which may in like manner be called the meafures of the
-ratios.
Let us now fuppofe that unity, or I, is affumed as the
common confequent of all ratios whatever ; and that
the ratio of 10 (or fome particular number) to 1 is
compounded of a very great number of equal ratios, as
for example 1000,000 : then, as each of thefe will be
very near to the ratio of equality, (for it will be the
ratio of the firfl: term to the fecond of a feries of one
million and one continued proportionals, the firft of
which is 10 and laft 1), it will follow, and is eafy to
conceive, that the ratios of all other numbers to unity
will each be very nearly equal to fome multiple of that
fmall ratio. And by fuppofing the number of final 1
equal ratios of which the ratio of io4o 1 is compofed
to be Efficiently great, the ratios of all other numbers
to unity may be as nearly equal to ratios which are
multiples of that fmall ratio as we pleafe. Let us ftill
fuppofe, however, for the fake of illuftration, that the
number of fmall ratios contained in that of 10 to 1 is
1000,000 then, as it may be proved that the ratio of a
to 1 will be very nearly the fame as a ratio compofed of
301030 of thefe •, and that the ratio of 3 to 1 will be
nearly equal to a ratio compofed of 477121 of them,
and that the ratio of 4 to I will be nearly equal to a
ratio compofed of 602060 of them, and fo on j thefe
numbers, viz. looocoo, 301030, 477121, and 602060,
or any other numbers proportional to them, will be the
meafures of the ratios of 10 to 1, 2 to 1, 3 to 1, and 4
to 1, refpeftively ; and the fame quantities will alfo be
what have been called the logarithms of the ratios •, for
the word logarithm, if regard be had to its etymology,
is Aayaiv u^6o)t or the numbers of fmall and equal
I T K M S.
ratios (or ratiuncultf as they have been called) con- Nature of
tained in the feveral ratios of quantities one to another. Logarithms*
We have for the fake of illuftration, affumed 1000000 &cg'
as the meafure of the ratio of 10 to 1, by which it hap- v~n
pens, as already obferved, that the meafures of the
ratios of 2 to I, 3 to 1, &c. are 301030 and 477121
refpedlively ; as, however, thefe meafures are not abfo-
lute, but relative quantities, We may affume any other
numbers whatever inftead of thefe, provided they have
the fame proportions to each other as thefe numbers
have among themfelves. Accordingly, we may.affume 1
as the meafure or logarithm of the ratio of 10 to 1 j and
then the logarithms of the ratios of 2 to 1, 3 to 1, &c.
inftead of being 301030, 477121, &c. will be .301030
and .477121, &c. refpedively, that is, each will be the
one-millionth of what it was before.
In Briggs's fyftem, the logarithm of the ratio of 10
to 1, or, to fpeak briefly, the logarithm of 10, is unity j
but we are at liberty to affume any number whatever
as that whofe logarithm (hall be unity. Napier, in con-
fequence of his particular views of the fubjefl, chofe
the number 2.718282 j and hence it happens that the
logarithms of the ratios are expreffed by different num*
bers in the two fyftems.
It yet remains for us to fhew the identity of the pro¬
perties of logarithms, as explained in the two different
views we have now given of the fubjeft j and this may
be done as follows.
Let A and B denote any two numbers. The ratio
of their produdt to unity, that is, the ratio of A X B to
I, is compounded of the ratio of AxB to B, and of
B to 1 j (fee Geometry Part III. Def. 10.) but fince
AxB, B, A, and 1 are four proportionals, the ratio of
AxB to B is equal to the ratio of A to 1. There¬
fore the ratio of A X B to 1 is compounded of the
ratio of A to 1 and of B to 15 and confequently the
logarithm of the ratio of A X B to 1 will be equal to
the fum of the logarithms of the ratios of A to 1, and
of B to 1 5 or in other words, the logarithm of A X B
will be the fum of the logarithms of A and B.
And becaufe log. (AxB)=tlog. A-flog. B, there¬
fore, log. Brrrlog. (A X B)—log. A. In this equation
let — be fubftituted for B, and D for A, then, (be-
c c
caufe A X B—D x —~C) wrehave log. ——log. C—
log. D.
We have now given a ffiort Iketch of the theory
of logarithms as deducible from the doftrine of ratios.
It was in this way that the celebrated Kepler treated
the fubjeft according to the ftri&eft rules of geometri¬
cal reafoning j and in this he has been followed by Mer¬
cator, Halley, Cotes, as well as by other mathemati¬
cians of later times, as by Mr Baron Maferes, in his
“ Elements of Plane Trigonometry,” a work in which
the whole theory of logarithms is treated with all that
perfpicuity and accuracy which chara&erize the ingeni¬
ous author’s various writings. The fame mode of treat¬
ing the fubjefl was likewife adopted by that excellent
geometrician Dr Robert Simfon, as appeal's by a ffiort
tra& in Latin, written by him and publiffied in his poft-
humcus w'orks. As, howrever, the doftrine of ratios is
of a very abftracl nature, and the mode of reafoning up¬
on which it has been eftabliflied is of a peculiar and
fubtle kind, wTe prefume that the greater number of
readers
L O G A R
Nature of readers will think this view of the fubjeft lefs flmple
Logarithms,an(j natural than the following, in which we mean to
| deduce the theory of logarithms, as well as the manner
0f computing them, from the properties of the exponents
ef powers.
If wTe attend to the common fcale of notation in
arithmetic, we fliall find that it is fo contrived as to
exprefs all numbers whatever by means of the powers
of the number 10, which is the root of the fcale, and
the nine digits which ferve as coefficients to thefe
powers. Thus, if R denote 10, the root of the fcale,
fo that R* will denote 100, and R3 1000, and fo on,
the number 47i5'c>9 is otherwife expreffed by 4Rs-r
7R4_j_ jR 3 which is equivalent to
Again, the mixt number

As to vulgar fraftions, by transforming them to deci¬
mals, they may be exprefied in the fame manner.
Tl,uSi=.375=3R-I+7R-J+jR~3- Alfa |=
.666, &c.=6R-i+6R-j+6R-34. &c.
Although the number 10 has been fixed upon as the
root of the fcale of notation, any other number may
be employed to exprefs all numbers whatever in the
fame manner ; and feme numbers are even preferable
to 10. Thus, making 8 the root of a fcale, and de¬
noting it by R, the number 2735, when expreffed ac¬
cording to this fcale, is 5R3 + iR1-}-5RIff-7R°, or
5R3+2RI + 5R-}-7 ; and here we may obferve, that if
a number greater than 10 wTere affumed as the root of
the fcale of notation, it would be neceffary to adopt
fome new numeral charafters in addition to thofe in
common ufe, and if a fmaller number wrere affumed,
we might difpenfe with fome of thofe we already
have.
But inftead of expreffing all numbers by the fums of
certain multiples of the fucceflive powrers of fome par¬
ticular number, we may alfo exprefs them, if not accu¬
rately, at leaf! as near as we pleafe, by a fingle power,
whole or fractional, of any pofitive number whatever,
which may be either wdrole or fractional, but mult not
be unity.
Let us take, for example, 2 as the number, by the
powders of which all others are to be expreffed. Then
it may be Ihewn that the numbers 1, 2, 3, &c. are all
expreffible by the powrers of 2, as follows.

When numbers are expreffed in this way by the
powers of fome given number r ; the exponent of that
power of r which is equal to any afjigncd number is
called the logarithm of that number. Therefore, if rN—v,
(« being put for any number) then N will be the loga¬
rithm of the number n.
The logarithms which are produced by giving to r
fome determinate value conffitute aof logarithms,
and the conllant number r, from which the fyltem is
formed, is called the bafe or radical number of the
fyliem.
The properties of logarithms may be readily deduced
from the above definition as follows. Let a and b be
put for any two numbers, and A and B for their loga¬
rithms j then, r being fuppofed to denote the bafe, or
radical number of the fyliem, wre have a—r^ and
b^zr^ : now if we take the produCt of a and b, we
have a b=zr^ x ; but according to the de¬
finition, A-J-B is the logarithm of a b, (for it is the in¬
dex of that power of r which is equal to a b) therefore^
the fum of the logarithms of any two numbers a and b is
the logarithm of their producl a b. Again, we have
a rA
— =: —5-—rA but here A—B is the index of that
b rB
Q
power of r which is equal to ? therefore, A—B is the
logarithm of — 5 hence, if one number a be divided by
another number b, the excefs of the logarithm of the divi¬
dend above that of the divifor is equal to the logarithm
of the quotient
Let n exprefs any number whatever, then, railing
both fides of the equation a~r^ to the ttth power, we
have an~(rA') =rwA 5 but here « A is manifeltly
the logarithm of an ; therefore, the logarithm of an, any
power of a number, is the producl of the logarithm of the
number by n, the index of the power. And this mvf
evidently be true, whether that index be a whole num¬
ber, or a frattion, either poftive or negative.
From thefe properties it is eafy to fee in wffat man¬
ner a table that exhibits the logarithms of all numbers
wdthin certain limits may be applied to fimplify calcula-.
tions : for fince the fum of the logarithms of any two
numbers is equal to the logarithm of their produCl ; it
follows, that as often as we have occafion to find the
produCl of two or more numbers, we have only to add
their logarithms into one fum, taking them from the
table, and to look in the table for the number whofe
logarithm is equal to that fum, and this number will be
the produCl required. Alfo, becaufe the excefs of the
logarithm of the dividend above that of the divifor is^
equal to the logarithm of the quotient 5 as often as we
have occafion to divide one number by another, \ye have.

only to fubtraft the logarithm of the divifor from that
of the dividend, and oppofite to that logarithm in
, the table, which is the remainder, we ihall find the
quotient.
As the logarithm of -any powder of a number is the
produ£t of the logarithm of the number, and the in¬
dex of the power j and on the contrary, the logarithm
of any root of a number is the quotient found by di¬
viding the logarithm of the number by the index of the
root j it follows, that we may find any power or root of
a number, by multiplying the logarithm of the number
by the index of the power, or dividing it by the index
of the root, and taking that number in the table whofe
logarithm is the product or quotient for the power or
root required.
If in the equation a—r^ (where a is any number,
A its logarithm, and r the bafe of the fyftem) we fup-
pofe a=zl, then, in this cafe rA = i 3 bnt this .equation
can only be fatisfied by putting Amo. Hence it ap¬
pears, that in every fujlem of logantnins, the logarithm
of unity tnujl be c. It on the; other hand w7e alfume
n—r ,• then we have the equation r~r^~, which is im¬
mediately fatisfied by putting A~I ; thereiore, the lo¬
garithm of the bafe, or radical number of every fyjlem is
neceffarily unity.
If we fuppofe r to be a pofitive number greater than
unity, and a a pofitive number greater than unity, then
A will be a pofitive number 5 for if it be negative we
would have a{^vz.r zr—a proper fra£Uon, and at
the fame time a number greater than unity by hypothe-
11s, which is impofiible. If on the contrary we fup¬
pofe a a proper fraction, then A tnuft necefiarily be ne¬
gative, for if it were pofitive, then rA would be greater
than unity, and tf(—rA) alfo greater than unity, while
by hypothefis it is a fraction lefs than unity, which is
impofiible. Therefore, in every fystem, the bafe of which
is greater than unity, the logarithm af a whole or mixt
number is always pofitive, but the logarithm of a proper
fraction is always negative.
Becaufe the logarithm of r is unity, the logarithm
of rn will be n; therefore, the logarithm of any integer
power of the radical number r will always be an in¬
teger.
Let r and r1 denote bafes of two different fyftems j
and let A be the logarithm of a number, a, taken ac¬
cording to the firft of thefe, and A' its logarithm taken
according to the laft. Then becaufe a rr rA, and
a—r,?>J, it followrs that r^rzr* , and r—r1^. Let us
now fuppofe that r" is the bafe of a third fyftem of lo¬
garithms, and R and R' the logarithms of r and r' ta¬
ken according to this third fyilem $ then becaufe
I T H M S.

Hence it appears, that the logarithm of a number, taken
according to one fystem, has to its logarithm, taken ac¬
cording to any other fystem, a con fart ratio, which is the
fame as that of the reciprocals of the logarithms of the
radical numbers of thofe fystems, taken according to any
fystem whatever.
Let us next fuppofe, that a and b are two numbers,
and A and B their logarithms, taken according to the
fame fyftem, and r the bafe of the fyftem j then becaufe
A B / .

Having now explained the properties wdiich belong
to the logarithms of any fyftem whatever, we proceed
to inveftigate general rules by which the number cor-
refponding to any logarithm, and on the contrary, the
logarithm correfponding to any number, may be found
the one from the other. And for this end let us de¬
note any number whatever by y, and its logarithm by x,

the fyftem •, then by the nature of logarithms we have

as we have already remarked. Now this is the {yftem
which was adopted by Lo?~d Napier; and although the
logarithms which were computed according to this fyf¬
tem. or upon the fuppofition that the radical number is
2.7x82818 &.c. have been called hyperbolic logarithms
becaufe they happen to be proportional to certain hy¬
perbolic fpaces, yet, asqbe logarithms of every fyftem
have the fame property, it is more proper to call them
Nepierean logarithms.
As the conftant multiplier

which is a general formula for the logarithm of any
number whatever, to the bafe r. And it is to be re-
colle&ed that in the fradlion •——, which is a common
log. r
multiplier to the feries, the logarithms are to be taken
according to the lame bafe, which however may be any
number whatever (b).
Jf in the above formula we fuppofe rrre-, the multiplier
the general formula for the logarithm of any num¬
ber, is the only part of the formula which depends for
its value upon the bafe of the fyftem, it has been called
by writers on logarithms, the modulus of the fyftem.
If we fuppofe the logarithms taken to the bafe e, then
the numerator, viz. log. e, will be unity, and the de¬
nominator will be the Napierean logarithm of r. If
however w’e fuppofe the logarithms taken to the bafe r,
then the numerator will be log. e to bafe r; and the
denominator will be unity, fo that the modulus of any
fyftem whofe bafe is r, is the reciprocal of the Napierean
logarithm of that bafe; or it is the logarithm of the
number e (the bafe of the Napierean fyftem) to the
bafe r.
In the Napierian .fyftem the modulus is unity, and
hence the logarithms of this fyftem, as far as depends
upon facility of computation, are the moft limple of
any. It was however foon found that a fvftem whofe
bafe ftrould be the fame as the root of the fcale of the
arithmetical notation, viz. the number 10, would be the
moft convenient of any in practice •, and accordingly
inch a fyftem was adlually conftrufted by Mr Briggs.
This is the only one now in common ufe, and is called
Briggs's fystem, alfo the%common fjstcm of logarithms.
The modulus of this fyftem therefore is the reciprocal
of the Napierean logarithm of 10 j or it is the common
logarithm of e~2.7182818 &c. the bafe. of the Na-
perean fyftem. We (hall in future denote this modulus
by M ; fo that the formula expreffmg the common lo¬
garithm of any number y will be
W. v=M 5v-z>*+ &c ?
If the number y, whofe logarithm is required be very
near to unity, lb that 1—y is a fmall quantity, then
the logarithm may be found from this formula with
great eafe, becaufe the feries will converge very rapid¬
ly. If, however, I—y be greater than unity, the fe¬
ries, inftead of converging, will diverge, fo as to be in
its prefent form of no ufe.
It may however be transformed into another, which
{hall converge in every cafe, by fubftituting in it n\fy
inftead of y, and obferving that leg.

for it is evident that y being greater than unity, n\/y

It is evident that by giving to n\fy fuch a value that
n^y—i is a fraftion lefs than unity, we render both
the feries for the value of log. y converging ; for as
H ■s/y—i is a fraction lefs than unity, the expreffion
- —A will alfo be lefs than unity, feeing that it is
nVy
equal to V ^ Therefore, in the firft feries, the fe-
n\/y
cond and third terms (taken together as one term) con-
ftitute a negative quantity, and as the fame is alfo true
of the fourth and fifth, and fo on j the amount of all
the terms after the firft is a negative quantity, that is a
quantity which is to be fubtra&ed from the firft, that
we may have the value of log. y. Hence we may in¬
fer that
log. y^LnU{»i/y—i).
And fince, on the contrary, the terms of the fecond fe¬
ries are all pofitive, the amount of all the terms after
the firft is a pofitive quantity, that is, a quantity which
muft be added to the firft to give the value of " log. y;
fb that we have
therefore if we take either the one or the other of the
two preceding expreflions for log. y, the error in excefs
or defeat is neceffarily lefc than this quantity.
By thefe formulas we may depend upon having the
logarithm of any number true to m figures, if we give
to n fuch a value that the root n \/y fliall have m cy¬
phers between the decimal point and the firft fignifi-
cant figure on the right. So that in general, as the er¬
ror is the fmaller according as n the exponent of the
root is greater, we may conclude that it becomes no¬
thing, or may be reckoned as nothing, when n is taken
indefinitely great •, and this being the cafe, we may con¬
clude that either of thefe expreflions
«M(Vy—1)> «M(i—
is the accurate value of log. y.
The beft manner of applying the preceding formula
is to take fome power or the number 2 for n ; for by
doing fo, the root n\/y may be»found by a repetition
of extra£lions of the fquare root only. It was in this
way that Briggs calculated the firft logarithms ; and
he remarked, that if in performing the fucceflive extrac¬
tions of the fquare root, he at laft obtained twice as many
decimal places as there were cyphers after the decimal
point, the integer before it being unity, then the deci¬
mal part of this root was exactly the half of that which
went before ; fo that the decimal parts of the two roots
were to each in the fame proportion as their logarithms:
now this is an evident confequence of the preceding
formula.
To give an example of the application of the formu¬
la, let it be required to find the numerical value of M,
the modulus of the common fyftem of logarithms,
which, as it is the reciprocal of the Napierean logarithm
of i o is equal to
- x r—7 nearly,
n n\/lO—I J

This method of computing logarithms is evidently
attended with great labour, on account of the number
of extractions of roots which it requires, to obtain a re-
fult true to a moderate number of places of figures.
But the two feries, which we have given, ferve to
fimplify and complete it. For, whatever be the number
7/, it is only neceflary to proceed with the extractions of
the fquare root, till we have obtained for a value
which is unity followed by a decimal fraCtion; and
then n\/i/—I, being a fraCtion, its powers will alfo be
fractions, which will be fo much the fmaller as their
exponents are greater 5 thus a certain number of terms
of the feries will ferve to exprefs the logarithm to as
many decimal places as may be required.
There are yet other analytical artifices by which the
feries
log.y = M|y-i-^(y-i)J-j-}(y-03-|(y-04+&c-}
may be transformed into others which (hall always
converge, and in particular the following. Let 1 -\-u

Having now explained, at confiderable length, the
theory of logarithms upon principles purely analytical,
fuch being, as we conceive, the moft natural way of
reafoning concerning the properties of number, we (hall
conclude this fe£lion by dating briefly the ground upon
which it was referred to the principles of geometry by
the mathematicians of the 17th century. Let C be the
centre, and CH, CK the aiymptotes of an hyperbola.
In either of thefe let there be taken any number of con¬
tinual proportionals CA, CB, CD, CE, &.c, then if
B b, D </, E c, &c. be drawn parallel to the other
afymptote, meeting the curve in a, b, d, e, &c. the hy¬
perbolic fpaces AabBi Bbdt), Dr/eE, &c. are
equal to one another ; alfo if ftraight lines be drawn
from C to the points a, b, d, e, &c. the hyperbolic
feftors a C b, b C d, dC e, &c. (hall alfo be equal
(Conic Sections Part III. prop. 30.) Now, fince it

appears by this propofition that the fegmer.ts CA, CB, Description
CD, CE, &c. of the afymptote being taken in con- ^
tinued geometrical progrefiion, the correfponding hy-1 , - 1
perbolic areas A a b B, A adl), A e E, &c. conft:-
tute a feries of quantities in continued arithmetical pro¬
grefiion, it is evident that the two feries will have, in re-
fpe£t to each other, the fame properties as numbers and
their logarithms; fo that, if we afifume C A any fegment
of the afymptote asthe reprefentative of unity, and fup-
pofe CB, CD, CE, &c. to be the reprefentatives of
other numbers, the hyperbolic areas AabB, AadD,
AaeK will be the geometrical reprefentatives of the lo¬
garithms of thefe numbers ; and fo alfo will the hyper¬
bolic fe61ors Cab, C b d, C de, &c.
Let CA (the line denoting unity) be the fide of a
rhombus CAaL inferibed at the vertex of the hyper¬
bola, and let CP~//xCA (« being put for any num¬
ber) ; draw Pp parallel to CL meeting the hyperbola
in p, then it may be (hewn, by the methods ufually
employed in reafoning about curvilineal areas, that the
area of the rhombus A a LC is to the hyperbolic area
AapB as 1 to the Napierean logarithm of the number
n. Therefore if the hyperbola be equilateral, fo that
AaL.c is afquare, &c. confequently itsaream X I—r,
the Napierean logarithm of and the area AapB may¬
be taken as the mutual reprefentatives of each other.
It is this circumftance which induced mathematicians
to call thefe logarithms hyperbolic. But with equal
propriety might the logarithms of any other fytlem be
called hyperbolic, as they may be equally expreffed by
the area of the equilateral hyperbola, or indeed by the
area of any hyperbola whatever, (fee Fluxioxs 5 152.

DESCRIPTION AND USE OF THE TABLE.
THE common fyftem of logarithms is fo confirufled,
that, o being the logarithm of unity, or 1, the loga¬
rithm ofTo is 1 $ by which it happens that the loga¬
rithm of 100 is 2, that of 1000 is 3, and fo on. Alfo,
the logarithm of T\>> or .1, is —1, that is, 1 confider-
ed as fubtraftive $ or, in. the language of algebra,
minus one j and the logarithm of or .01, is —2 j
and the logarithm of .ooi is —’3, and fo on, as in the
following (hort table.

As the terms of the geometrical progreffion 1, 10,
100, &c. continued backwards as well as forward, are
the only numbers whofe logarithms are integers $ the
logarithms of all other numbers whatever muft be either
fra&ions, or mixt numbers. Accordingly, the loga¬
rithms of all numbers, whether integer or mixt, be¬
tween 1 and 10 are expreffed by decimal fractions lefs
than
L O G A R
toefcriptlon than unity-. The logarithms of numbers between 10
and Uie of an(J 10o are expreffed by mixt numbers compofed of
the Table. unity and a decimal fradion. The logarithms of num-
bers between too and 1000 are expreffed by mixt num¬
bers compofed of the number 2 and a decimal fraction,
and fo on. On the other hand, the logarithm of any
vulgar or decimal fradlion lefs than I, but greater
than -/q- or .1, will be fome negative decimal fraflion
between o and —i •, and the logarithm of any fradlion
between .1 and .01, will be a negative mixed quantity
between —1 and —2, and fo on.
But it muff be remarked, that any fradlion, or mixt
number, confidered as entirely negative, may always
be transformed into another mixt number of equal va¬
lue, that (hall have its integer part negative, but its
fractional part politive, by diminiihing the integer by
unity, and increaiing the fractional part by the fame
quantity. Thus let the mixt quantity be —2^, which
may be alfo written thus —2—T^. Let the integer
—2 be dlminifhed by 1, and the refult is —2—J =—3.
Alfo, let the fr*£lion—-,V be increafed by 1, and it
becomes —TV -f- 1 = + ^ > therefore the fra&ion
—2TV or — 2.3, when transformed, is —3 -{- or
—3 which may be written thus,, 3.7 •, where the ne¬
gative lign is placed over the integer to indicate that it
is the only part of the expreffion that is confidered as
negative, the other part, viz. .7, being reckoned pofi-
tive.
Since therefore any fraClional or mixt quantity, con-
lidered as entirely negative, is equivalent to another
mixt quantity, the integer part of which only is nega¬
tive, but the fractional part poiitive, it is evident that
Inftead of expreffing the logarithms of fraClions by num¬
bers confidered as entirely negative, we may exprefs
them by numbers having their integer parts negative,
Und their decimal parts pofitive 5 and it is ufual fo to
exprefs them. Thus the logarithm of .03, inftead of
being expreffed by —1.52288, that is, by —1—.52288,
is ufually expreffed by 2.47712, by which is to be un-
derftood —2-f.477i2. Again, the logarithm of .7,
which, if coniidered as entirely negative, would be
—.15490, is otherwife 1.84510.
As the logarithms of any leries of numbers forming
a geometrical progreflion, the common ratio of which
is 10, will exceed each other by the logarithm of 10,
that is, by 1, it fellows that the logarithms of all num¬
bers denoted by the fame figures, and differing only in
the pofition of the decimal point, wall have the decimal
part of their logarithms the fame ; but the integers
ftanding before the decimals will be different, and will
be pofrtive or negative, according as the numbers are
whole or fractional, as in thefe examples.

The table of logarithms given at the end of this ar¬
ticle, contains the decimal parts of the logarithms of
all numbers from 1 to 10,000 j and indeed of all num¬
bers which can be expreffed by four figures, preceded
or followed by any numbers of cypher^, fuch as the
numbers 367500, .002795, &c. The index, however,
is not put down 5 but it is eafily fupplied by the rule
which has juft now been given. The table alfo con¬
tains the differences of the logarithms of all numbers
from 1000 to io,oco, by means of which the loga¬

I. To find the logarithm of any number confifiing of
four or any fmaller number of figures. Look for the
number in the columns titled at the top Numbers ; and
in the fame line with it, on the right, in the column of
logarithms, will be found the decimal part of its loga¬

2. To find the logarithm of a number confifiing of five
figures.
Find the decimal part of the logarithm of the firft
four figures of the number, (that is, find the logarithm
of the propofed number as if the laft figure were a cy¬
pher), by the preceding rule, and find the difference
between that logarithm and the next greater, as given
in the column of differences (to the right of the column
of logarithms). Then ftate this proportion :
As 10,
To the tabular difference,
So is the laft, or fifth figure of the number,
To a fourth proportional j
which being added to the former logarithm, and the
decimal point and index fupplied, will be the logarithm
fought.
Example. Required the logarithm of 186.47. The
decimal part of the logarithm of the firft four figures,
viz. 1864, is .27045, and the difference oppofite to it
in the column marked D on the top is 23. Therefore
we have this proportion :

Seek the decimal part of the propofed logarithm in
the column of logarithms, and if it be found exactly,
the figures of the number correfponding to it will be
found in the fame line with it in the column of num¬
bers. If the index of the given logarithm is 3, the
four figures of the numbers thus found are integers j but
if it be 2, the three firft figures are integers, and the
fourth is a decimal, and fo on ; the number of integer
figures before the decimal point being always one great¬
er than the index, if it be pofitive 5 but if it be nega¬
tive, the number fought will be a decimal, and the
number of cyphers between the decimal point and firlt
fignificant figure will be one lefs than the index.—Ex¬
amples. The number correfponding to the logarithm
3‘57392 3749* number correfponding to
1.12775 is 13.42. The number correfponding to
3.3692213 .00234, and fo on.
But if the given logarithm is not exactly found in
the table, fubtradf the next lefs tabular logarithm from
it, and take the difference between that logarithm,
and the next greater (as given in the column of differ-
t ences). Then flate this proportion :
As the difference, taken from the table,
Is to 10,
So is the difference between the given logarithm and
the next lefs,
To a fourth proportional,
which being annexed to the four figures correfponding
to the logarithm next lefs than the given one, will be
the logarithm required.
Example. Find the number anfwering to the loga¬
rithm 4,13278,

The dec. part of given log. is 327S Deicdptio!i

proportion,
20x10 , .
22 : 10 :: 20 :  —6 nearly.

The tabic of logarithms of numbers is followed by a
Table of logarithmic Sines and Tangents, for evenj mi¬
nute of the quadrant, with their differences. For the
explanation of this table we refer to Trigonometry,
to which branch of mathematics it is intended to be
applied.
We fliall now give pradfical rules, illuftrated by ex¬
amples, for performing the different operations of arith¬
metic by logarithms.
MULTIPLICATION by Logarithms.
Rule.
Take out the logarithms of the fadlors from the
table •, then add them together, and their fum will be
the logarithm of the produft required. Then find, by
infpedlion of the table, the natural number anfwering
to their fum, and it will be the produdf required.
Obferving to add what is to be carried from the de¬
cimal part of the logarithm to the pofitive index or in¬
dices, or elfe fubtradl it from the negative.
Alfb adding the indices together when they are of
the fame kind, that is, both pofitive or both negative;
but fubtradfing the lefs from the greater when the one
is pofitive and the other negative, and prefixing the
fign of the greater to the remainder.

the fame name, or their difference when they have dif¬
ferent figns, with the fign of the greater for the index
to the logarithm of the quotient.
Alfo, when 1 is borrowed in the left-hand place of

of the divifor when that index is pofitive, but fubtraft
it when negative 5 then let the index arifing from thence

Multiply the logarithm of the given number by
the index of the power, and the number anfwering to
the product will be the power required.
Noie.—In multiplying a logarithm with a negative
index by a pofitive number, the produdl will be nega¬
tive. But what is to be carried from the decimal part
of the logarithm will always be pofitive. And there¬
fore the difference will be the index of the produft,
and is always to be made of the fame kind with the

GH, IK, LM, which let be continually proportional,
and reprefent numbers, viz. AB, 1 j CD, 10 j EF,

arithmetical and geometrical: for the lines AC, AE,

4, 5, &c. and fo reprefent the logarithms to which the
geometrical lines AB, CD, EF, &c. do correfpond.
For fince AG is triple of the firft line AC, the number
GH fhall be in the third place from unity, if CD be in

ALrrrj AC. If the extremities of the proportionals
5, d, B, D, F, &c. be joined by right lines, the figures
SBML will become a polygon, confifting of more or

the terms is become lefs, and approaches nearer to a ratio
of equality than before. Likewife, in this new feries,
the right lines AL, A c, exprefs the diftances of the
terms LMcr/, from unity, viz. fince AL is ten times
greater than A c, LM {hall be the tenth term of the
feries from unity -, and becaufe A <? is three times great¬

there will be nine mean proportionals. And if the ex¬

If, in this manner, mean proportionals be continual¬
ly placed between every two terms, the number of

of the fides of the polygon, as to be greater than any
given number, or to be infinite 5 and every fide of the
polygon fo leffened, as to become lefs than any given

mic Lines. e(j after thls manner is called logarithmical.
^ js man;fell from this defcription of the logarith¬
mic curve, that all numbers at equal diftances are con¬
tinually proportional. It is alfo plain, that if there
be four numbers, AB, CD, IK, LM, fuch that the
diltance between the firft and fecond be equal to the
diftance between the third and the fourth, let the di-
ftance from the fecond to the third be what it will, thefe
numbers will be proportional. For becaufe the diftances
AC, 1L, are equal, AB ftiall be to the increment Dj-,
as IK is to the increment MT. Wherefore, by com-
pofition, AB : DC : : IK : ML. And, contrariwife,
if four numbers be proportional, the diftance between
the firft and fecond (hall be equal to the diftance be¬
tween the third and fourth.
The diftance between any two numbers is called the
logarithm of the ratio of thofe numbers; and, indeed,
doth not meafure the ratio itfelf, but the number of terms
in a given leries of geometrical proportionals, proceed¬
ing from one number to another, and defines the num¬
ber of equal ratios by the compofition whereof the ra¬
tios of number is known.
Logarithmic Lines. For many mechanical purpofes
it is convenient to have the logarithms of numbers laid
down on fcales, as well as the logarithmic fines and
tangents 5 by 'which means computations may be car¬
ried on by mere menfuration with compafles. Lines
of this kind are always put on the common Gunter’s
fcale; but as thefe inftruments mull be extended to a
very great length, in order to contain any confiderable
quantity of numbers, it becomes on objedl of import¬
ance to Ihorten them. Such an improvement has been
made by Mr William Nicholfon, and publilhed in the
77th volume of the Philofophical Tranfadtions. The
principles on which the conftrudtion of his inftruments
depends are as follow :
1. If two geometrical feries of numbers, having the
fame common ratio, be placed in order with the terms
oppofite to each other, the ratio between any term in
one feries and its oppofite in the other will be conftant:
Thus,
2 6 18 54 162, &c.
3 9 27 81 243, &c. Then,
2 3 6 9 18 27 54 81 162 243, &c.
where it is evident, that each of the terms in the upper
feries is exadlly trvo-thirds of the correfponding one in
the lower.
2. The ratio of any two terms in one feries will be
the fame with that between thofe which have an equal
diftance in the other.
3. In all fuch geometrical feries as have the fame ra¬
tio, the property above mentioned takes place, though
we compare the terms of any feries with thofe of ano¬
ther : Thus,
2 4 8 16 32 64, &c. *
3 6 12 24 48 96, &c.
4 8 16 32 64 128, &c.
5 10 20 40 80 160, &c. $ where it is
plain that 2, 4, 3, 6; alfo 2, 4, 4, 8, and 2, 4, 5, IO, &c.
have the fame ratio with that of each feries.

bers in geometrical progreflion *, then, from the Condi- Logamh-
tion of the arrangement, and the property of this lo- ,nilC ^in ’,
garithmic line, it follows, ill, That every right line fo
drawn will, by its interfedfions, indicate a geometrical
feries of numbers ; 2dly, That fuch feries as are indi¬
cated by thefe right lines will have the fame common
ratio; and, jdly, That the feries thus indicated by two
parallel right lines, fuppofed to move laterally, without
changing either their mutual diftance or parallelifm to
themfelves, will have each the fame ratio and in all
feries indicated by fuch two lines, the ratio between an
antecedent and confequent j the former taken upon one
line, and the latter upon another, will be alfo the fame.
The I ft of thefe propofitions is proved in the fol- Plate
lowing manner. Let the lines AB, CD, EF, repre- CCXCVII.
fent parts of the logarithmic line arranged according II'
to the proportion already mentioned j and let GH be
a right line palling through the points e, c, a, denoting
numbers in geometrical progreflion •, then will any
other line IK, drawn acrofs the arrangement, likewife
pafs through three points f d, Z>, in geometrical progref-
fion. From one of the points of interfedlion f 'm the
laft-mentioned line IK, draw the line fg parallel to
GH, and interfering the arrangement in the points
1, hi; and the ratios of the numbers e,f c /, will be equal,
as well as of ah} becaufe the intervals on the loga¬
rithmic line, or differences of the logarithms of thofe
numbers, are equal. Again, The pointyi the line
and the line kb, are in arithmetical progreflion denoting
the differences between the logarithms of the numbers
themfelves 5 whence the quotients of the numbers are in
geometrical progreflion.
The 2d propofition is proved in a fimilar manner.
For as it was Ihown that the line fg, parallel to GH,
paffes through points of divifion denoting numbers in
the fame continued ratio as thofe indicated by the line
GH j it may alfo be drown, that the line LM parallel
to any other line IK, will pafs through a feries of
points denoting numbers which have the fame continued
ratio with thofe indicated by the line IK, to which it is
parallel.
The 3d propofition arifes from the parallelifm of the
lines to their former fituation ; by which means they
indicate numbers in a geometrical feries, having the fame
common ratio as before : their diftance on the loga¬
rithmic line alfo remains unchanged; whence the dif¬
ferences between the logarithms of the oppofite num¬
bers, and of confequence their ratios, will always be
conftant.
5. Suppofing now an antecedent and confequent to
be given in any geometrical feries, it will always be
poffible to find them, provided the line be of unlimited
length. Drawing two parallel lines, then, through each
of the numbers, and fuppofing the lines to move with¬
out changing their diredion or parallel fituation, they
will continually defcribe new antecedents and confe-
quents in the fame geometrical feries as before.
6. Though the logarithmic line contain no greater-
range of numbers than from 1 to 10, it will not be
found neceffary for the purpofes of computation to re¬
peat it. The only tiling requifite is to have a Aider
or beam with two fixed points at the diftance of the
interval betwixt 1 and 10, and a moveable point made
to range betwixt them always to indicate the antece¬
dent ; then, if the confequent fixed point fall with-
R out
LOG [ r
Logarith- out the rule, the other fixed point will always denote
mic Lines. t]-,e divJf10n Dn which it would have fallen had the
rule been prolonged ; and this contrivance may ealily be
adapted to any arrangement of parallel lines whatever.
The arrangement of right lines, however, ought al¬
ways to be difpofed in fuch a manner as to occupy a
right-angled parallelogram, or the crofs line already
mentioned ought always to be at right angles to the
length of the ruler.
Tig. y. is a ruler confifting cf ten parallel lines.—
Fig. 8. a beam-compafs for meafuring the intervals.
B, A, C, are the parts which apply to the furface of
the ruler; the middle one, A, being moveable fidewife
in a groove in the piece DE, fo as always to preferve
its parallelifm to the external pieces DC, which are
fixed at a diifance equal to the length of the ruler, and
liave their edges placed in fuch a manner as to form
with the parallel lines which they interfeft a ratio,
which by compofition is ^-s *, which in the prefent cafe
requires them to be at right angles to the length. The
piece DE is applied to the edge FG of the ruler. The
edges or borders H, I, K, L, are more conveniently
made of tranfparent horn, or tortoife-fhell, than of any
opaque matter.
In ufing this ruler, apply the edge of either B or
C to the confequent, and Hide the piece A to the an¬
tecedent ; obferving the difference between the num¬
bers on the pieces denoting the lines they are found
on : then, applying the fame edge of A to any other
antecedent, the other piece B or C will interfe& a con¬
fequent in the fame ratio upon that line, having the
fame fituation with regard to the antecedent that the
line of the former confequent had to its antecedent.
But if B be the confequent piece, and fall without the
ruler, the piece C will fhovv the confequent one line
lower j or if C, in like manner, fall without the ruler,
then B will Ihow the confequent one line higher.—
“ It might be convenient (fays Mr Nicholfcn) for the
purpofe of computation, to make infiruments of this
kind with one hundred or more lines : but in the pre¬
fent inftrument, the numbers on the pieces will anfwer
the fame purpofe ; for if a confequent fall upon a line
at any given number of intervals without the ruler, it
will be found on that line of the arrangement which oc¬
cupies the fame number of intervals reckoned inwards
from the oppofite edge of the ruler.”
Fig. 9. is an inftrument on the plan of a Gunter’s
fcale of 28^ inches long, invented by Mr Robert-
fon. There is a moveable piece AB in the Aider
GH, acrofs which is drawn a fine line ; the Aider ha¬
ving alfo lines CD, EF, drawn acrofs it at diAances
from each other equal to the length of the ruler AB.
In ufing the inftrument, the line CD or EF is to be
placed at the confequent, and the line in AB at the
30 ] LOG
antecedent: then, if the piece AB be placed at any
other antecedent, the fame line CD or EF will indicate
its confequent in the fame ratio taken the fame way :
that is, if the antecedent and confequent lie on the
fame fide of the Aider, all other antecedents and confe-
quents in that ratio will be in the fame manner j and the
contrary if they do not. But if the confequent line fall
without the rule, the other Axed line on the Aider will
Aiovv the confequent, but on the contrary fide of the
Aider to that where it would clfe have been feen by
means of the firft confequent Ime.
Fig. ic. is a circular inftrument equivalent to the
former ; confifting of three concentric circles engraved
and graduated upon a plate of an inch and a half dia¬
meter. Two legs A and B proceed from the centre,
having right-lined edges in the direction of radii 5 and
are moveable either fingly or together. In ufing the
inftrument, place one of the edges at the antecedent
and the other at the confequent, and fix them at the
angle. Move the two legs then together ; and having
placed the antecedent leg at any other number, the
other will give the confequent one in the like po-
fition on the lines. If the line CD happen to lie be¬
tween the legs, and B be the confequent leg, the num¬
ber fought will be found one line farther from the cen¬
tre than it would otherwife have been ; and on the con¬
trary, it will be found one line nearer in the like cafe,
if A be the confequent leg. “ This inftrument (lays
Mr Nicholfon), differing from that reprefented fig. 7.
only in its circular form, and the advantages reiulting
from that form, the fines muft be taken to fucceed each
other in the fame manner laterally; fo that numbers
which fall either within or without the arrangement of
circles, will be found on fuch lines of the arrangement
as would have occupied the vacant places if the fucccf-
fion of lines had been indefinitely repeated fidewife.
“ I approve of this conftruflion as fuperior to every
other which has yet occurred to me, not only in point
of convenience, but likewife in the probability of be¬
ing better executed ; becaufe fmall arcs may be gradu¬
ated with very great accuracy, by divifions transferred
from a larger original. The inftrument, fig. 7. may
be contained conveniently in a circle of about four
inches and a half diameter.
“ The circular inftrument is a combination of the
Gunter’s line and the feftor, with the improvements
here pointed out. The property of the feclor may be
ufeful in magnifying the differences of the logarithms
in the upper parts of the fine of fines, the middle of the
tangents, and the beginning of the verfed fines. It is
even poflible, as mathematicians will eafily conceive, to
draw fpirals, on which graduations cf parts, everywhere
equal to each other, will fliow the ratios of thofe fines
by moveable radii, fimilar to thofe in this inftrument.”

This fcience is generally divided into four parts,

This divilion comprehends the whole biliary of the
fenfations and operations of the human mind.
PART I. OF PERCEPTION.
WE find ourfelves furrounded with a variety of ob-
jefts, which afting differently upon our fenfes, con¬
vey ditlinfl impreflions into the mind, and thereby
roufe the attention and notice of the underllanding.
By refle&ing too on what paffes within us, we become
fenfible of the operations of our own minds, and at¬
tend to them as a new- fet of impreflions. But in all
this there is only bare confcioufnefs. The mind, with¬
out proceeding any farther, takes notice of the im-
preflions that are made upon it, and views things in
order, as they prefent themfelves one after another.
This attention of the underllanding to the objedl act¬
ing upon it, whereby it becomes fenfible of the im-
preffions they make, is called by logicians perception ;
and the notices themfelves, as they exilt in the mind,
and are there treafured up to be the materials of think¬
ing and knowledge, are dillinguilhed by the name of
ieteas. In the article METAPHYSICS it lhall be Ihown
at large, how the mind, being furnilhed with ideas,
contrives to diverlify and enlarge its Hock : we have
here chiefly to conlider the means of making know-n our
thoughts to others ; that we may net only underftand
how- knowledge is acquired, but alfo in what manner
it may be communicated with the greatell certainty and
advantage.
Chap. I. Of Words, confdered as thefgns of our Ideas.
Words for- I. Our ideas, though manifold and various, are ne-
nifh the, verthelefs all within our own breafts, invifible to o-
means of t]ierSj nor can 0f themfelves be made appear. But
ouCr°ownS God, defigning us for fociety, and to have fellowlhip
thoughts; with thole of our kind, has provided us with organs
fitted to frame articulate founds, and given us alfo a
capacity of tiling thofe founds as figns of internal con¬
ceptions. Hence fpring words and language : for,
having once pitched upon any found to Hand as the
mark of an idea in the mind, Quftom by degrees efta-
blilhes fuch a connexion between them, that the ap¬
pearance of the idea in the underftanding always brings
to our remembrance the found or name by w-hich it
is expreffed ; as in like manner the hearing .of the
found never fails to excite the idea for which it is made
to Hand. And thus it is eafy to conceive how a man
may record his own thoughts, and bring them again
into view in any fucceeding period of life. For this
connexion being once fettled, as the fame founds will
always ferve to excite the fame ideas ; if he can but
contrive to regifler his words in the order and difpo-
fition in which the prefent train of his thoughts pre¬
fent themfelves to his imagination, it is evident he will
be able to recal thefe th ughts at pleafure, and that too
in the very manner of their firft appearance. Ac¬
cordingly we find, that the inventions of writing and
printing, by enabling us to fix and perpetuate fuch
perilhable things as founds, have alfo furnilhed us with
the means of giving a kind of permanency to the
tranfaflions of the mind, inforauch that they may be
in the fame manner fubjedled to our review as any other
objects of nature. _ 2
II. But belides the ability of recording our ow-n and of thie
thoughts, there is this farther advantage in the ufe ofmutual
external figns, that they enable us to communicate
our thoughts to others, and alfo to receive inf01'ma^0n knowledge
of what pafl'es in their breafts. For any number of men,fromone
having agreed to eftabhfh the fame founds as figns ot man to anor
the fame ideas, it is apparent that the repetition oftiier>
thefe founds mull excite the like perceptions in each,
and create a perfe£l correfpondence of thoughts.
When, for inllance, any train of ideas fucceed one
another in my mind, if the names by which I am
wont to exprefs them have been annexed by .thofe
with whom I converfe to the very fame fet of ideas,
nothing is more evident, than that, by repeating thofe
names according to the tenor of my prefent concep¬
tions, I lhall raife in their minds the fame courfe of
thought as has taken pofleffion of my own. lor by
barely attending to what pafles within themfelves
upon hearing the founds which I repeat, they will al¬
fo become acquainted with the ideas in my under¬
llanding, and have them in a manner laid before their
view-. °So that we here clearly perceive how a man
may communicate his fentiments, knowledge, and dif-
coveries to others, if the language in which he con-
verfes be extenlive enough to mark all the ideas and
tranfaftions of his mind. But as this is not always
the cafe, and men are often obliged to invent terms
of their own to exprefs new views and concep¬
tions of things j it may be alked, how in thefe cir-
cumftances we can become acquainted with the thoughts
of another, w-hen he makes ufe of w-ords, to which
we have never annexed any ideas, and that of courfe
can raife no perceptions in our minds ? In order to un¬
veil this myllery, and give fome little inlight into tiie
foundation, growth, and improvement of language,
the following obfervations will be found of conlider-
able moment. 3
III. Firft, That no word can be to any man thesimple
fign of an idea, till that idea comes to have a real ex- ideascannot
iftence in his mind. For names, , being only fo far in-^jconvey-
telligible as they denote known internal concePtions i^ind by
w-here they have none fuch to anfw-er them, there worcjs> or
they are plainly founds without fignification, and ofadeferip-
courfe convey no inllruflion or know-ledge. But nod011*
fooner are the ideas to w-hich they belong raifed in the
underftanding, than, finding it eafy to conned! them
with the eftablilhed names, we can join in any .agree¬
ment of this kind made by others, and thereby enjoy the

benefit of their difcovencs. The firfl: thing therefore to
be confidered is, how thefe ideas may be conveyed in¬
to the mind ; that being there, we may learn to con¬
nect them with their appropriated founds, and fo be¬
come capable of underllanding others when they make
ufe of thefe founds in laying open and communicating
their thoughts. Now, to comprehend this diltinftly,
it will be neceffary to attend to the divilion of our
ideas into fimple and complex, (fee Metaphysics.)
And firft, as for our limple ideas; they can find no
admiffion into the mind, but by the two original
fountains of knowledge, fenfation and reflection. If
therefore any of tbefe have as yet no being in the un-
derflanding, it is impoffible by wmrds or a defcription
to excite them there. A man who had never felt the
fenfation of heat, could not be brought to comprehend
that fenfation by any thing we might fay to explain
it. If we would really produce the idea in him, it
inuft be by applying the proper objeCl to his fenfes,
and bringing him within the influence of a hot body.
When this is done, and experience has taught him
the perception to which men have annexed the name
heat, it then becomes to him the fign of that idea,
and he thenceforth underftands the meaning of the
term, which, before, all the words in this w-orld would
not have been fufficient to convey into his mind. The
cafe is the fame in refpeCl of light and colours. A
man born blind, and thereby deprived of the only con¬
veyance for the ideas of this clafs, can never be brought
to underfland the names by which they are expreffed.
The reafon is plain : they ftand for ideas that have no
exiflence in his mind ; and as the organ appropriated
to their reception is wanting, all other contrivances
are vain, nor can they by any force or defcription be
raifed in his imagination. But it is quite otherwife
in our complex notions. For thefe being no more
than certain combinations of fimple ideas, put toge¬
ther in various forms; if the original ideas out of
which the colle&ions are made have already got ad-
million into the underftanding, and the names ferving
to exprefs them are known $ it will be eafy, by enu¬
merating the feveral ideas concerned in the compofi-
tion, and marking the order and manner in which
they are united, to raife any complex conception in
the mind. Thus the idea anfwering to the word rain¬
bow may be readily excited in the imagination of ano¬
ther w7ho has never feen the appearance itfelf, by bare¬
ly defcribing the figure, largenefs, polition, and or¬
der of colours j if wre fuppofe thefe feveral fimple ideas,
with their names, fufficiently known to him.
IV. And this leads to a fecond obfervation upon this
fubjeft, namely, That words Handing for complex
ideas are all definable, but thofe by which we denote
fimple ideas are not j for fimple ideas being fecondary
perceptions, winch have no other entrance into the
mind than by fenfation or refleflion, can only be got
by experience, from the feveral objefts of nature, pro¬
per to produce thofe perceptions in us. Words indeed
may very well ferve to remiftd us of them, if they have
already found admiflion into the underftanding, and
their connexion with the eftablilhed names is known $
but they can never give them their original being and
exiftence there. And hence it is, that when any one
alks the meaning of a word denoting a fimple idea,
we pretend not to explain it to him by a definition,
well knowing that to be impoflible ; but, fuppofing Of
him already acquainted with the idea, and only igno- Perception.^
rant of the name by which it is called, we either men¬
tion it to him by fume other name with which we
prefume he knows its connexion, or appeal to the ob¬
ject where the idea itfelf is found. Thus, were any
one to afk the meaning of the word white, we ftiould
tell him it ftood for the fame idea as albus in Latin, or
b/anc in French j or, if we thought him a ftranger to
thefe languages, we might appeal to an objedt produ¬
cing the idea, by faying it denoted the colour we ob-
lerve in fnow or milk. But this is by no means a de¬
finition of the word, exciting a new idea in his un¬
derftanding } but merely a contrivance to remind him
of a known idea, and teach him its connexion with
the eftablilhed name. For if the ideas after which he
inquires have never yet been raifed in his mind ; as
fuppofe one who bad feen no other colours than black
and white, ftiould alk the meaning of the word fear let ;
it is eafy to perceive, that it wmuld be no more pof-
fible to make him comprehend it by words, or a defi¬
nition, than to introduce the fame perception into the
imagination of a man born blind. The only method
in this cafe is, to prefent fome objc£t, by looking at
w hich the perception itfelf may be excited; and thus
he will learn both the name and the idea together. ^
V. But howr comes it to pafs that men agree in the Experience
names of their fimple ideas, feeing they cannot view and obfer-
the perceptions in one another’s minds, nor make known ',atlon
thefe perceptions by wmrds to others? The effeft is^1^^^
produced by experience and obfervation. Thus find- rnent ;n tke
ing, for inftance, that the name of heat is annexed to names of
that fenfation which men feel when they approach thefimpfe
fire, I make it alfo the fign of the fenfation excited iri^eas-
me by fuch an approach, nor have any doubt but it
denotes the fame perception in my mind as in theirs.
For wre are naturally led to imagine, that the fame ob¬
jects operate alike upon the organs of the human bo¬
dy, and produce an uniformity of fenfations. No man
fancies, that the idea raifed in him by the tafte of fu-
gar, and which he callsfweetnefs, differs from that ex¬
cited in another by the like means j or that worm-
wood, to whofe relilh he has given the epithet bitter,
produces in another the fenfation which he denotes by
the word fweet. Prefuming therefore upon this con¬
formity of perceptions, when they arife from the fame
objects, we eafily agree as to the names of our fimple
ideas : and if at any time, by a more narrow ferutiny
into things, new ideas of this clafs come in our way,
which we choofe to exprefs by terms of our own in¬
vention j thefe names are explained, not. by a defini¬
tion, but by referring to the objetffs whence the ideas
themfelves may be obtained. ^
VI. Being in this manner furnilhed with Amplecon_
ideas, and the names by w’hich they are expreffed \ the veyance of
meaning of terms that ftand for complex ideas is ea-complex
fily got, becaufe the ideas themfclves anfwering t° ^e-
thefe terms may be conveyed into the mind by defi- wife contri-
nitions. For our complex notions are only certain Vance in na~
combinations of fimple ideas. When therefore thefe ture;
are enumerated, and the manner in which they are
united into one conception explained, nothing more
is wanting to raife that conception in the underftand¬
ing j and thus the term denoting it comes of courfe to
be underftood. And here it is worth while to refledl
Part I. L O
Of a little upon the wife contrivance of nature, in thus
Percepticn. fjimifting us with the very aptefl. means of commu-
v ~' nicating our thoughts. For were it not fo ordered,
that ive could thus convey our complex ideas from
one to another by definitions, it would in many cafes
be impoffible to make them known at all. This is
apparent in thofe ideas which are the proper work of
the mind. For as they exift only in the underftand-
ing, and have no real objects in nature in conformity
to which they are framed j if we could not make them
known by defcription, they maft lie for ever hid with¬
in our own breafts, and be confined to the narrow
acquaintance of a fingle mind. All the fine fcenes
that flrife from time to time in the poet’s fancy, and
by his lively painting give fuch entertainment to his
readers, were he dellitute of this faculty of laying
them open to the view of others by words and de¬
fcription, conic? not extend their influence beyond his
own imagination, or give joy to any but the original
y inventor.
and of VII. There is this farther advantage in the ability
great avail we enjoy of communicating our complex notions by
improve-the ^e^n^ons » that as thefe make by far the largeft clals
ment of our ideas, and moft frequently occur in the progrefs
knowledge. ajtd improvement of knowledge, fo they are by thefe
means imparted with the greateft readinefs, than
which nothing would tend more to the increafe and
fpreading of fcience : for a definition is foon perufed ;
and if the terms of it are well underftood, the idea
itfelf finds an eafy admiflion into the mind. Whereas,
in fimple perceptions, where we are referred to the
objefts producing them, if thefe cannot be come at, as
is fometimes the cafe, the names by which they are
exprefled mull remain empty founds. But new ideas
of this clafs occurring very rarely in the fciences, they
feldom create any great obftru&ion. It is otherwife
with our complex notions *, for every ftep we take
leading us into new combinations and views of things,
it becomes neceffary to explain thefe to others, before
they can be made acquainted with our difcoveries :
and as the manner of definitions is eafy, requiring no
apparatus but that of jvords, which are always ready,
and at hand ; hence we can with the lefs difficulty re¬
move fuch obftacles as might arife from terms of our
own invention, when they are made to Hand for new
complex ideas fuggefted to the mind by fome prefent
train of thinking. And thus at laft we are let into
the myftery hinted at in the beginning of this chapter,
viz. how we may become acquainted with the thoughts
of another, when he makes ufe of words to which we
have as yet joined no ideas. The anfwer is obvious
from what has been already faid. If the terms denote
fimple perceptions, he muft refer us to thefe objects of
nature whence the perceptions themfelves are to be
obtained j but, if they Hand for complex ideas, their
meaning may be explained by a definition.
Chap. II. Of Definition.
Definition I- A Definition is the unfolding of fame conception
defined. of the mind, anfiwering to the word tr term made ufe of
as the fign of it. Now as, in exhibiting any idea to ano¬
ther, it is neceffary that the defcription be fuch as may
excite that precife idea in his mind; hence it is plain
that definitions, properly fpeaking, are not arbitrary, but

fpeaker or writer to the words he ufes. As never- 1,7
thelefs it is univerfally allowed that the fignification of
words is perfedlly voluntary, and not the effect of any
natural and neceffary connexion between them and
the ideas for which they ftand ; fome may perhaps
wonder why definitions are not fo too. In order
therefore to unravel this difficulty, and ffiow diftin&ly
what is and what is not arbitrary in fpeech, we mult
carefully diltinguiffi between the connexion of our
words and ideas, and the unfolding of the ideas them¬
felves. ^
II. Firft, as to the connexion of our words and ideas; The con-
this, it is plain, is a purely arbitrary inftitution. When, nex^on he-
for inftance, we have in our minds the idea of any^,rdsand
particular fpecies of metals, the calling it by the name jdcajaper-
gold is an effect of the voluntary choice of men fpeak- fectly vo-
ing the fame language, and not of any peculiar aptnefs luntary e-
in that found to exprefs that idea. Other nations we
find make ufe of different founds, and with the famemen ’
effect. Thus aurum denotes that idea in Latin, and
or in French ; and even the word gold itfelf would
have as well ferved to exprefs the idea of that metal
which we call fiver, had cuftom in the beginning eita-
blilhed it. r®
III. But although we are thus entirely at liberty in The dc.
conne£ling any idea with any found, yet it is quite ^nPG°n of
otherwife in unfolding the ideas themfelves. For. e- b^bound-’
very idea having a precife appearance of its own, by ed to the
which it is diftinguilhed from every other idea: it is reprefenta-
manifeft, that in laying it open to others, we muft t*on .or tbat
ftudy fuch a defcription as ffiall exhibit that peculiar pearancefby
appearance. When we have formed to ourfelves the which they
idea of a figure bounded by four equal lides, joined are diftin-
togetber at right angles, we are at liberty to exprefs ll-
that idea by any found, and call it either a fquare or a ^°nsf ,
triangle. But whichever of thefe names we ufe, fo cmeves“
long as the idea is the fame, the defcription by which
we would fignify it to another muft be fo too. Let it
be called fquare or triangle, it is ftill a figure having
four equal fides, and all its angles right ones. Hence
we clearly fee what is and what is not arbitrary in the
ufe of words. The eftablilhing any found as the mark
of fome determinate idea in the mind, is the effedt of
free choice, and a voluntary combination among men :
and as different nations make ufe of different founds
to denote the fame ideas, hence proceeds all that va¬
riety of languages which we meet with in the world.
But when a connexion between our ideas and words
is once fettled, the unfolding of the idea anfwering to
any word, which properly conftitutes a definition, is
by no means an arbitrary thing: for here we are
bound to exhibit that precife conception which either
the ufe of language, or our own particular choice,
hath annexed to the term we ufe. ri
IV. And thus it appears, that definitions, confidcred Cauies of
as deferiptions of ideas in the mind, are fteady and in- the obicurk
variable, being bounded to the reprefentation of thefe Vlhat has
precife ideas. But then, in the application of defini- hetrhjgt0d
tions to particular names, we are altogether left to our j^theory
own free choice. Becaufe as the conne&ing of any ofdefini-
idea with any found is a perfeftly arbitrary inftitu-tions*
tion, the applying the defcription of that idea to that .
found muft be fo too. When therefore logicians tell
134
Of . us tliat the definition of the name is arbitrary, they
Perception. mean no more tllan this; that as different ideas may
be connefted with any term, according to the good
pleafure of him that ufes it; in like manner may dif¬
ferent defcriptions be applied to the term, fuitable to
the ideas fo connected. But this connexion being
fettled, and the term confidered as the fign of fome
fixed idea in the underftanding, we are no longer left to
arbitrary explications, but muff fludy fuch a defcrip-
tion as correfponds with that precife idea. Now this
alone, according to what has been before laid down,
ought to be accounted a definition. What feems to
have occafioned no final 1 confufion in this matter, is,
that many explanations of words, where no idea is
unfolded, but merely the connexion between fome
word and idea aflerted, have yet been dignified with
the name of definitions. Thus, when W'e fay that
a clock is an injlrument by which we meafure time;
that is by fome called a definition ; and yet it is plain
that wre are beforehand fuppofed to have an idea of
this infhument, and only taught that the word clock
ferves in common language to denote that idea. By
this rule all explications of words in our dictionaries
will be definitions, nay, the names of even fimple ideas
may be thus defined. White, we may fay, is the co¬
lour we obferve in fnow or milk ; heat the fenfation
produced by approaching the fire; and fo in innumera¬
ble other inftances. But thefe, and all others of the
like kind, are by no means definitions, exciting new
ideas in the underftanding, but merely contrivances to
remind us of known ideas, and teach their connexion
with the eftablifhed names.
Complex V. But now' in definitions properly fo called, w'e
ideas alone firft confider the term we ufe, as the fign of fome in¬
capable of ward conception, either annexed to it by cuftom, or
that kind of our own free choice : and then the bufmefs of the'de-
wbicKoes finiti°n is to unfold and explicate that idea. As there¬
by tlie name l0re tlm whole ait lies in giving juft and true copies
of a ded*i- of our ideas; a definition is then find to be made per-
tion. when it ferves diftinftly to excite the idea de-
feribed in the mind of another, even fuppofing him
before wholly unacquainted with it. This point fet¬
tled, let us next inquire what thofe ideas are which
are capable of being thus unfolded ? and in the firft
place it is evident, that all our fimple ideas are necef-
farily excluded. We have feen already that expe¬
rience alone is to be confulted here, infomuch that if
either the objefts whence they are derived come not
in our way, or the avenues appointed by nature for
their reception are wanting, no defeription is f'ufficient
to convey them into the mind. But where the un¬
derftanding is already fupplied with thefe original and
primitive conceptions, as they may be united together
in an infinity of different forms ; fo may all their fe-
veral combinations be diflinclly laid open, by enume¬
rating the fimple ideas concerned in the various col-
le&ions, and tracing the order and manner in which
they are linked one to another. Now thefe combi¬
nations of fimple notices conftitute wftiat w'e call our
complex notions, whence it is evident, that complex
ideas, and thofe alone, admit of that kind of deferio-
tion which goes by the name of a definition.
VI. Definitions, then, are pidures or reprefenta-
% tions of our ideas ; and as thefe reprefentations are
then only poffible when the ideas themfelves are
2
Part I.
complex, it is obvious to remark, that definitions Of
cannot have place, but where we make ufe of terms Perception,
ftanding for fuch complex ideas. But our complex "* v '
ideas being, as we have faid, nothing more than dif¬
ferent combinations of fimple ideas ; we then know and
comprehend them perfedUy, when wre know' the feveral
fimple ideas of w'hich they confift, and can fo put them
together in our minds as may be neceffary towards the
framing of that peculiar connexion which gives every
idea its diftind and proper appearance. ^
VII. Two things are therefore required in every Two thino-s
definition: firft, Ibat all the original ideas, out of required m
which the complex one is formed, be diftindly enu-a definition»
merated ; and, fecondly, That the order and manner of
combining them into one conception be clearly ex- khas'am!
plained. Where a definition has thefe requilites, no-explain the
thing is wanting to its perfedion ; becaufc every onemanner°i'
who reads it and underftands the terms, feeing at once tl?eir.corn'
what ideas he is to join together, and alio in what Dmatl°nS'
manner, can at pleafure form in his own mind the
complex conception anfvvering to the term defined.
Let us, for inftance, fuppofe the word fquare to Hand
for that idea by which w’e reprefent to ourfelves a
figure whofe fides fubtend quadrants of a circumfcribed
circle. The parts of this idea are the fides bounding
the figure. Thefe mull be four in number, and all
equal among themfelves, becaufe they are each to fub¬
tend a fourth part of the fame circle. But, befides
thefe component parts, we mull alfo take notice of
the manner of putting them together, if we would ex¬
hibit the precife idea for which the word fquave here
Hands. For four equal right lines, anyhow joined,
will not fubtend quadrants of a circumfcribed circle.
A figure with this property mull have its fides ftand¬
ing alfo at right angles. Taking in therefore this laft
confideration refpeiling the manner of combining the
parts, the idea is Lilly deferibed, and the definition
thereby rendered complete. For a figure bounded by
four equal fides, joined together at right angles, has
the property required ; and is moreover the only right-
lined figure to which that property belongs. I4
VIII. It will now be obvious to every one, in what How we
manner we ought to proceed, in order to arrive at juft a,e t0 P™-
and adequate definitions. Firft, We are to take anc.eed t0,arJ
ex-aft view .of die idea to be deferibed, trace it to its and ade^
original principles,, and mark the feveral fimple per- quate defi.
ceptions that enter into the compofition of it. Second-nitions.
ly, We are to confider the particular manner in which
thefe elementary ideas are combined, in order to the
forming of that precife conception for which the term
we make ufe of Hands. When this is done, and the
idea wholly unravelled, we have nothing more to do
than fairly tranferibe the appearance it makes to our
own minds. Such a defeription, by diftimftly exhibit¬
ing the order and number of our primitive conceptions,
cannot fail to excite at the fame time in the mind of
every one that reads it, the complex idea refulting from
them ;. and therefore attains the true and proper end of
a definition.

In corn. Many of our ideas are extremely complicated, info-
pour.ding much that to enumerate all the fimple perceptions out
our ideas, Qf which they are formed, would be a very trouble-
we proceed pime an(j tedious work. For this reafon logicians
five21 rada-'kave eitabliffied certain compendious rules of defining,
tion/ cf which it may not be amifs here to give fome ac¬
count. But in order to the better underftanding of
what follows, it will be necefiary to ebferve, that
there is a certain gradation in the compofition of cur
ideas. The mind of man is very limited in its views,
and cannot take in a great number of objects at or.ee.
We are therefore fain to proceed by Heps, and make
our firfit advances lubfervient to thofe which follow.
Thus, in forming our complex notions, we begin at
firft with but a few fimple ideas, fuch as we can ma¬
nage with eafe, and unite them together into one con¬
ception. When we are provided with a fufficient
itock of thefe, and have by habit and ufe rendered
them familiar to our minds, they become the compo¬
nent parts of other ideas ftill more complicated, and
form what we may call a fecond order of compound
notions. This procefs, as is evident, may be continued
to any degree of compofition we pleafe, mounting from
one ftage to another, and enlarging the number ot com-
^ binations.
Hence ideas H- But now in a feries of this kind, whoever would
of this clafs acquaint himfeif perfe&ly with the laft and higheft
beft com- order of ideas, finds it much the moft expedient me-
prehended, (UjQd (-0 proceed gradually through all the interme-
advance£ diate fleps. For, were he to take any very compound
gradually idea to pieces, and, without regard to the feveral
through all clafies of fimple perceptions that have already been
the feveral formed into diftinft combinations, break it at once in-
Oio.n. its original principles, the number would be fo great
as perfectly to confound the imagination, and over¬
come the utmofl reach and capacity of the mind.
When v/e fee a prodigious multitude of men jumbled
together in crowds, without order or any regular pofi-
tion, we find it impoflible to arrive at an exact know¬
ledge of their number. But if they are formed into
feparate battalions, and fo ftationed as to fall within
the leifure furvey of the eye *, by viewing them fuccef-
fively and in order, we come to an eafy and certain de¬
termination. It is the fame in our complex ideas.
When the original perceptions, out of which they are
framed, are very numerous, it is not enough that we
take a view of them in loofe and fcattered bodies j we
muft form them into diftind! clafles, and unite thefe
claffes in a juft and orderly manner, before wre can ar¬
rive at a true knowledge of the compound notices re-
fulting from them.
III. This gradual progrefs of the mind to its com-
tTons fliould Pountl notions, through a variety of intermediate fteps,
keep pace plainly points out the manner of conducing the defi-
withour nitions by which thefe notions are conveyed into the
obferve^ m"ic*s ot^ers- Bor as the feries begins with fimple
like grada- an<^ cafy combinations, and advances through a fuc-
tion. ceffion of different orders, riling one above another in
the degree of compofition, it is evident, that, in a train
of definitions exprefling thefe ideas, a like gradation
is to be obferved. Thus the complex ideas of the
lowed order can no otherwife be deferibed than bv

ideas of which they confift. They may be more diltindl-
ly and briefly unfolded, by enumerating the compound
ideas of a lower order, from whole union they refult,
and which are all fuppofed to be already known in con-
fequence of previous definitions. Here then it is that
the logical method of defining takes place ; which, that
it may be the better underftood, we lhall explain forae-
what more particularly the feveral fteps and gradations
of the mind in compounding its ideas, and thence de¬
duce that peculiar form of a definition which logicians
have thought fit to eftablilh. jS

ptner. Hence, by collecting the reiembkng particulars cuiar t0 ge_
into one conception, we form the notion of a fpecies. ner&l ideas.
And here let it be obferved, that this laft idea is lefs
complicated than that by which we reprefent any of
the particular objefls contained under it. For the idea
of the fpecies excludes the peculiarities of the feveral
individuals, and retains only fuch properties as are
common to them all. Again, By comparing feveral
fpecies together, and obferving their refemblance, we
form the idea of a genus ; where, in the fame manner
as before, the compofition is leffened, becaufe we
leave out what is peculiar to the fevsral fpecies com¬
pared, and retain only the particulars wherein they
agree. It is eafy to conceive the mind proceeding
thus from one ftep to another, and advancing through
its feveral claffes of general notions, until at laft it
comes to the higheft genus of all, denoted by the wrard
being, where the bare idea of exiftence is only con¬
cerned.
V. In this procedure we fee the mind unravelling The edn-
a complex idea, and tracing it in the afeending fcale,'Hk the
from greater or lefs degrees of compofition, until itmm 1 m
terminates in one fimple perception. If now we take
the feries the contrary way, and, beginning with the ideas, as it
laft or higheft genus, carry our view downwards, advances
through all the inferior genera and fpecies, quite to through
the individuals, we ftiall thereby arrive at a orders
apprehenfion of the conduft of the underftanding in0fperceii-
compounding Sts ideas. For, in the feveral claffes of tion.
our perceptions, the higheft in the fcale is for the
moft part made up of but a few fimple ideas, fuch as
the mind can take in and furvey with eafe. This firft
general notion, when branched out into the dift'erent
fubdivifions contained under it, has in every one of
them fomething peculiar, by which they are diftin-
guiflied among themfelves j infomuch that, in de-.
feending from the genus to the fpecies, we always
fuperadd fome new idea, and thereby increafe the
degree of compofition. Thus the idea denoted by the
w'ord figure is of a very general nature, and compo-
fed of but few fimple perceptions, as implying no
more than fpace everywhere bounded. But if wre
defeend farther, and confider the boundaries of this
fpace, as that they may be either Uries or furface, we

fall Into tlie feveral fpecies of figure. For where the
fpace is bounded by one or more furfaces, we give it the
name of a folidfigure ; but where the boundaries are
lines, it is called a plain figure (a).
VI. In this view of things it is evident, that the
fpecies is formed by fuperadding a new idea to the
genus. Here, for inftance, the genus is circumfcrib-
ed fpace. If now to this we fuperadd the idea of a
circumfcription by lines, we frame the notion of that
fpecies of figures which are called plain; but if we
conceive the circumfcription to be by furfaces, we
have the /fpecies of folid figures. This fuperadded Of
idea is called the fipecific difference, not only as it ferves Perception.^
to divide the fpecies from the genus, but becaufe,
being different in all the feveral fubdivifions, we there¬
by alfo dillinguilh the fpecies one from another. And
as it is likewife that conception, which, by being
joined to the general idea, completes the notion of
the fpecies : hence it is plain, that the genus and fpe¬
cific difference are to be confidered as the proper and
conflituent parts of the fpecies. If we trace the pro-
grefs of the mind ftill farther, and obferve it advancing
through
(a) This account of the compofition and refolution of our ideas is agreeable to the common do&rine of lo¬
gicians on the fubjeft. Into the truth of the do&rine itfelf we fhali inquire afterwards under the article
Metaphysics : but to prevent miftakes, it may be proper to obferve here, that though every writer of logic
has treated largely of general and fipecific ideas, there is in reality nothing general in the matter but the terms of
language. When we utter, for inftance, the word triangle, that general term does not, as has been often faid,
fuggeft to the mind the general idea of a triangle, which is neither oblique nor reBangle, neither equilateral nor
Ccalenon, &c. forfiuch a triangle, as it cannot exijl in nature, cannot be conceived in idea. In like manner, the
general term Vii'tue does not excite a general idea of virtue, which is neither prudence, nor temperance, nor fortitude,
nor jufiice, nor charity, &c. for that which is difiinSl from all thefe is not virtue. What then is the import of
fuch general terms ? The anfwer is obvious: they denote clajfies of objetfs ; and are never ufed without fome
word of limitation, but when fomething that has no dependence upon the particular qualities, which diftinguilh
the individuals from each other, is affirmed or denied of the whole clafs. Thus we may affirm, that the three
angles of a plain triangle are equal to tvco right angles: and this propofition is demonftrably true, not of a triangle,
which is neither oblique nor reBangle, neither equilateral nor ficalenon, for fuch a triangle never was conceived ;
but of all thefe triangles equally, as the truth of the propofition and the progrefs of the demonftration has no
dependence upon the peculiarities which difiinguifh thefe triangles from one another. Again, When we fay
that a man of virtue will be rewarded by God, we do not mean by the word virtue a general idea making part
of each of the complex and more particular ideas of prudence, fortitude, jujlice, &c. and at the fame time dif¬
ferent from them all ; but we affirm, that the man who pra£lifes any or all of thefe virtues, according as he has
opportunity, will be rewarded by God.
The hiftory of our ideas is ffiortly this :—That aft of the mind, if it may be called an aEt, which makes
known an external objeB, is termed perception. That aft of the mind which makes known an internal ob-
jeB, is termed consciousness. Objefts once perceived may be recalled to the mind by the power of me¬
mory; and when they are fo recalled, we have a perception of them in all refpefts fimilar to the original per¬
ception, only lefs diftinft ; we fancy ourfielves in the fame place, and the objeB perceived attended by the fame
circurrfiances. This indiftinft fecondary perception of an objeft is termed an idi:a 5 and therefore the precife
and accurate definition of an idea, in contradiftinftion to an original perception, is “ that perception of a real ob¬
jeft which is railed in the mind by the power of memory.” Now all our original perceptions being of par¬
ticular objcBs, it is obvious that our ideas, which are only thofe perceptions recalled, muft be of particular ob-
jeBs likewife, and that no man can have an idea of a thing of which the real exifence is contradiftory and im-
poffible. But the general and fpecific ideas of logicians, are ideas of nothing which exifis, or which can pojfbly
exi/l. They are acquired, we are told, by abf raBion, in the following manner. Among a number of indivi¬
duals wre perceive certain qualities the fame in all, whilft in each individual there are other qualities which
have nothing fimilar to them in any other individual : new the mind, it is faid, has a power of abftrafting
the particular qualities of each individual from thoje which are common to the whole, and of thefe laft forming a
general idea of the whole clafs. Thus all men have nearly the fame form ; and they have each fome future and
fome colour, though there are not perhaps two individuals who have precifehy the fame future and the fame colour.
Nowq fay the advocates for general ideas, if we abfiraB what is peculiar to each individual, and retain what is
common to the whole race, we have the general idea fignified by the word man. That is, if we conceive a being
in human fliape, which is oifature and colour, but neither tall nor fhort, neither while nor black, nor red nor
brown, nor any other colour which we ever fiaw, we have the general idea of humanity, and underftand the mean¬
ing of the word man ! Surely no perfbn who is not the flave of prejudice will pretend that he can frame fuch an
idea as this—the idea of an objeft which cannot poffibly exift in nature.
By this we do not mean to affirm, that we cannot frame ideas of fuch objefts as have no real exiftence ; for it
is as eafy to imagine a man with ten heads as with one, becaufe there is nothing contradiftory between ten heads
and one body. YtvX figure, which is faid to be fpace bounded neither by lines nor fuperfeies ; colour, which is nei¬
ther red wot white, nor blue nor black, &c. ; and animal, which is neither man, beajl, bird, nor infeB ; are im-
poffible in nature, and inconceivable in idea. There is, however, no harm in ftill retaining the general
idea, provided he who ules it takes care to let it be known, that by thefe words he means not any abfiraB and
contradiBory idea, but merely a clafs of real objeBs. The phrafe may at times prevent much circumlocution • for
yvhich reafon have retained the uie of it in the text.

Of through the inferior fpecies, we Hiall find its manner
Perception. 0f proceeding to be always the fame. For every lower
fpecies is formed by fuperadding fome new idea to the
fpecies next above it $ infomuch that in this defend¬
ing fcale of our perceptions, the underfianding paffes
through different orders of complex notions, which
become more and more complicated at every ftep it
takes. Let us refume here, for inftance, the Ipecies of
plain figures. They imply no more than fpace bounded
by lines. But if we take in an additional confideration
of the nature of thefe lines, as whether they are right or
curves, we fall into the fubdivifions of plain figure, di-
itinguifhed by the names of reEiilinear, curvilinear, and
2I mixtihnear.
And in all VII. And here we are to obferve, that though
the inferior pla-jn figures, when confidered as one of thofe branches
come under the notions of figure in general, take
ding the the name of a fpecies j yet compared with the claffes
ipecific dif- of curvilinear, rectilinear, and mixtilinear, into which
ference to they tbemfelves may be divided, they really become
a gcnus> which the beforementioned fubdivifions
genii.. conftitute the feveral fpecies. Thefe fpecies, in the
fame manner as in the cafe of plane and folid figures,
confift of the genus and fpecific difference as their
conftituent parts. For in the curvilinear kind, the
curvity of the lines bounding the figure makes what is
tailed thefpecific difference; to which if we join the
genus, which here is a plain figure or fpace circum-
fcribed by lines, we have all that is neceffary towards
completing the notion of this fpecies. We are only
to take notice, that this laft fubdivifion, having two
genera above it, viz. plain figure, and figure in gene¬
ral •, the genus joined with the fpecific difference, in
order to conftitute the fpecies of curvilinears, is that
which lies neareft to the faid fpecies. It is the ho-
tion of plain figure, and not of figure in general, that
joined with the idea of curvity, makes up the complex
conception of curve-lined figures. For in this de-
fcending fcale of our ideas, figure in general, plain
figures, curved-lined figures, the two firft are confider¬
ed as genera in relpeft of the third j and the fecond
in order, or that which Hands next to tbe third, is
called the nearejl genus. Rut now as it is this fecond
idea, which, joined with the notion of curvity, forms
the fpecies of curve-lined figures ; it is plain, that the
third or laft idea in the feries is made up of the near¬
eft genus and fpecific difference. This rule holds in¬
variably, however far the feries is continued ; becaufe,
in a train of ideas thus fucce^ding one another, all
that precede the laff are confidered as fo many genera
in refpeft of that laft j and the laft itfelf is always
formed by fuperadding the fpecific difference to the
genus next it.
The idea of VIII. Here then we have an urtiverfal defcription,
anyindivi- applicable to all our ideas of whatever kind, from the
higheft genus to the loweft fpecies. For, taking them
in order downwards from the faid general idea, they
everywhere confift of the genus proxirnum, and dif¬
ferentia fpecifica, as logicians love to exprefs them-
felves. But when we come to the low-eft fpecies of
all, comprehending under it only individuals, the fu-
peradded idea, by which thefe individuals are diftin-
guiftied one from another, no longer takes the name
of the fpecific difference. For here it ferves not to
denote diftinfr fpecies, but merely a variety of indivi-

duals, each of which, having a particular exiftence of
its own, is therefore numerically different from every Perce tl0n;
other of the fame kind. And hence it is, that in this
laft cafe, logicians choofe to call the fuperadded idea
by the name of the numerical difference; inl'omuch
that, as the idea of a fpecies is made up of the neareft
genus and fpecific difference, fo the idea of an indivi¬
dual confifts of the loweft fpecies and numeric differ¬
ence. Thus the circle is a fpecies of curve-lined fi¬
gures, and what wre call the lovoejl fpecies, as compre¬
hending under it only individuals. Circles in particu¬
lar are diftinguiftied from one another by the length
and pofition of their diameters. The length therefore
and pofition of the diameter of a circle form what logi¬
cians call the Jiumerical difference ; becaufe, theie being
given, the circle itfelf may be defcribed, and an indivi¬
dual thereby conftituted. 23

this method of procedure we are come to the loweft:

greftion, naturally points out the true and genuine
form of a definition. For as definitions are no more
than deferiptions of the ideas for which the terms de¬
fined Hand ; and as ideas are then defcribed, when
we enumerate diftin£lly and in order the parts of
which they confift 5 it is plain, that by making our
definitions follow7 one another according to the natural
train of our conceptions, they will be fubjedl to the
fame rules, and keep pace with the ideas they de-
feribe.

introduced into all fubfequent definitions, in the fame

together, in order to judge of their agreement or dif-
agreement. In this joint view of our ideas, if the re¬
lation is fuch as to be immediately difcoverable by the
^ , bare infpeflion of the mind, the judgements thence ob-
ceiveabVer- tained are called intuitive, from a word that denotes to
look at; for in this cafe, a mere attention to the ideas
compared fuffices to let us fee nowr far they are con-
nefted or disjoined. Thus, that the Whole is greater
than any of its Parts, is an intuitive judgement j no¬
thing more being required to convince us of its truth,
than an attention to the ideas of whole and [>art. And
this too is the reafon why we call the adl of the mind
forming thefe judgements zWttf/fo/z; as it is indeed no
more than an immediate perception of the agreement
or difagreement of any two ideas.
II. But here it is to be obferved, that our know¬
ledge of this kind refpe&s only our ideas, and the re¬
lations between them; and therefore can ferve only
as a foundation to fuch reafonings as are employed in
invefiigating thofe relations. Now it fo happens, that
many of our judgements are converfant about fadls, and
and the real exiftence of things which cannot be tra¬
ced by the bare contemplation of our ideas. It does
not follow7, becaufe I have the idea of a circle in my
mind, that therefore a figure anfwering to that idea
has a real exiftence in nature. I can form to myfelf
the notion of a centaur or golden mountain, but never
imagine on that account that either of them exifts.
What then are the grounds of our judgement in rela¬
tion to faffs ? experience and tejlimony. By experience
we are informed of the exiftence of the feveral ob-
jeffs which furround us, and operate upon our fenfes.
Teftimony is of a wider extent, and reaches not on¬
ly to objefts beyond the prefent fphere of our obfer-
vation, but alfo to faffs and tranfaffions, which being
now paft, and having no longer any exiftence, could
not without this conveyance have fallen under our cog¬
nizance.

ftXernent ^ec^§e may w^h eafe and advantage be derived. Firft,

ow c ge- clear and connefled feries of proofs, is faid to be
demonftrated, and produces abfolute certainty in the
mind. Hence the knowledge obtained in this man¬
ner is what Ve properly term fcience; becaufe in evefy
ftep of the procedure it carries its own evidence along

And what is highly worthy of notice ; as the truths
of this clafs exprefs the relations between our ideas,
and the fame relations muft ever and invariably fubfiff
between the fame ideas, our deduflions in the way of
fcience conftitute what we call eternal, necefary, and
immutable truths. If it be true that the whole is equal
to all its parts, it muft be fo unchangeably ; becaufe
the relation of equality being attached to the ideas
themfelves, muft ever intervene where the fame ideas
are compared. Of this nature all the truths of natu¬
ral religion, morality, and mathematics, and in general -
whatever may be gathered from the bare view and con-
fideration of our ideas. 2g
IV. The fecond ground of human judgement is ew-2. Experx-
perience; from which we infer the exiftence of thofe ence>the
objedt? that furround us, and fall under the immediate grou,nd of
notice of our fenfes. When we feen the fun, or call
our eyes towards a building, we not only have per- the powers,
ceptions of thefe objedfs within ourfelves, but afcribe ancl quali-
to them a real exiftence out of the mind. It is alfo *,‘.es °* k°'
by the information of the fenfes that we judge of thediei’
qualities of bodies ; as when we fay that fnow is white,
fire hot, or fieel hard. For as we are wholly unac¬
quainted with the internal ftrudlure and conftitution of
the bodies that produce thefe fenfations in us, nay, and
are unable to trace any connexion between that ftruc-
ture and the fenfations themfelves, it is evident, that
we build our judgements altogether upon obfervation,
afcribing to bodies fuch qualities as are anfwerable to
the perceptions they excite in us. Not that we ever
fuppofe the qualities of bodies to be things of the fame
nature with our perceptions •, for there is nothing in
fire fimilar to our fenfation of heat, or in a fword fimi-
lar to pain : but that when different bodies excite in
our minds fimilar perceptions, w7e neceffarily afcribe
to thefe bodies not only an exiftence independent of
us, but likewife fimilar qualities, of which it is the
nature to produce fimilar perceptions in the human
mind. But this is not the only advantage derived
from experience 5 for to that too wTe are indebted for
all ©ur knowledge regarding the co-exiftence of fen-
fible qualities in objefts, and the operations of bodies
one upon another. Ivory, for inftance, is hard and
elaftic ; this we know by experience, and indeed by
that alone. For, being altogether ftrangers to the true
nature both of elafticity and hardnefs, we cannot by
the bare contemplation of our ideas determine how
far the one neceffarily implies the other, or whether
there may not be a repugnance between them. But
when we obferve them to exift both in the fame ob-
jeft, we are then allured from experience that they
are not incompatible ; and when we alfo find, that a
ftone is hard and not elafticj and that air though ela-
Part II. L 0
Of flic is not fcard, we alfo conclude upon the fame foun-
Judgemmt- dation, that the ideas are not neceifarily conjoined,
X"‘^r J but may exift feparately in different objedls. In like
manner, with regard to the operations of bodies one
upon another, it is evident, that our knowledge this
way is all derived from obfervation. j4qud regia dif-
folves gold, as has been found by frequent trial, nor
is there any other wTay of arriving at the difeovery.
Naturalifts may tell us, if they pleafe, that the parts
of aqua regia are of a texture apt to infinuate between
the corpufcles of gold, and thereby looien and lhake
them afunder. If this is a true account of the matter,
it will notwithftanding be allowed, that our conjefture
in regard to the conformation of thefe bodies is de¬
duced from the experiment, and not the experiment
from the conjedture. It was not from any previous
knowledge of the intimate ftru&ure of aqua regia and
gold, and the aptnefs of their parts to a£t or to be ail¬
ed upon, that we came by the conclufion above men¬
tioned. The internal conflitution of bodies is in a
manner wholly unknown to us : and could we even
furmount this difficulty, yet as the feparation of the
parts of gold implies fomething like an ailive force in
the menjlruum, and we are unable to conceive how it
comes to be poffeffed of this aftivity, the effeil muft
be owned to be altogether beyond our comprehenfion.
But when repeated trials had once confirmed it, in-
fomuch that it was admitted as an eftabliffied truth
in natural knowledge, it was then eafy for men to
fpin out theories of their own invention, and con¬
trive fuch a ftruilure of parts, both for gold and aqua
regia, as would bed ferve to explain the phenomenon
upon the principles of that fyftem of philofophy they
had adopted.
V. From what has been faid it is evident, that as
intuition is the foundation of what we call fcientifical
knowledge, fo is experience of natural. For this lail
being wholly taken up with objects of fenfe, or thofe
bodies that conflitute the natural world j and their
properties, as far as we can difeover them, being to
be traced only by a long and painful feries of obferva-
tions 5 it is apparent, that, in order to improve this
branch of knowledge, we muft betake ourfelves to the
method of trial and experiment.
VI. But though experience is what wTe may term
the immediate foundation of natural knowledge, yet
with refpeft to particular perfons its influence is very
narrow and confined. The bodies that furround us
are numerous, many of them lie at a great diftance,
and fome quite beyond our reach. Life is fo ffiort,
and fo crowded with cares, that but little time is left for
any fingle man to employ himfelf in unfolding the my-
fteries of nature. Hence it is neceftary to admit many
things upon the teftimony of others, which by this
means becomes the foundation of a great part of our
knowledge of body. No man doubts of the power
of aqua regia to diffolve gold, though perhaps he ne¬
ver himfelf made the experiment. In thefe therefore
and fuch like cafes we judge of the fa£ls and opera-
tic?ns of nature upon the mere ground of teftimony.
However, as we can always have recourfe to expe¬
rience where any doubt or fcruple arifes, this is juftly
confidered as the true foundation of natural philofo¬
phy $ being indeed the ultimate fupport upon which

refult of its perceptions, we call it judgement; but when explained,
our judgements are put into wTords, they then bear the
name of propojitions. A propofition therefore is a fen-
tence expreffing fome judgement of the mind, whereby
two or more ideas are affirmed to agree or difagree.
Now, as our judgements include at leaft twro ideas, one
of which is affirmed or denied of the other, fo muft a
propofition have terms anfwering to thefe ideas. The
idea of which vve affirm or deny, and of courfe the
term expreffing that idea, is called the fubjeB of fhe
propofition. The idea affirmed or denied, as alfo the
term anfwering it, is called the predicate. Ihus in
the propofition, God is omnipotent: God is the fubjeft,
it being of him that w7e affirm omnipotence j and om¬
nipotent is the predicate, becaufe we affirm the idea ex-
preffed by that word to belong to God. 3r
II. But as, in propofitions, ideas are either joined ^he^°Pu'
or disjoined j it is not enough to have terms exprei- ’
fing thofe ideas, unlefs we have alfo fome words to
denote their agreement or difagreement. 1 hat word
in a propofition, which connetls two ideas together,
is called the copula ; and if a negative particle be an¬
nexed, we thereby underftand that the ideas are dif-
joined. The fubjlantive verb is commonly made ufe
of for the copula : as in the above mentioned propofi¬
tion, God is omnipotent; where is reprefents the co¬
pula, and fignifies the agreement of the ideas of God
and omnipotence. But if we mean to feparate two
ideas •, then, befides the fubftantive verb, we muft alfo
ufe fome particle of negation, to exprefs this repug¬
nance. The propofition, man is not perfeB, may ferve
as an example of this kind j where the notion of per-
feBion being removed from the idea of man, the ne¬
gative particle not is inferted after the copula, to fig-
nify the difagreement between the fubjeft and predi¬
cate. ^
III. Every propofition necefiarily confifts of
three parts j but then it is not alike needful that they times ex-
be all feverally expreffed in words*, becaufe the copula prefled by
is often included in the term of the predicate, as when a ^inS^e

force of a whole fentence. Thus amhulat is the fame
as ille eji ambulctns ; amo, as ego fum anions ; and fo in
innumerable other initances ; by which it appears,
that we are not fo much to regard the number of words
in a fentence, as the ideas they reprefent, and the man¬
ner in which they are put together. For wherever
two ideas are joined or disjoined in an expreflion, though
ot but a lingle word j it is evident that we have a fub-
jecl, predicate, and copula, and of confequence a com-
33 plete proportion.

gative ; and as any twro ideas compared together mufl
neceffarily either agree or not agree, it is evident that
all our judgements fall under thefe two divifions. Hence
likewife the propofitions expreffing thefe judgements
are al! either affirmative or negative. An affirmative
propofition connects the predicate with the fubjedl, as
ajlonc is heavy ; a negative propofition feparates them,
as God is not the author of evil. Affirmation therefore
ts the fame as joining two ideas together \ and this is
done by means of the copula. Negation, on the con¬
trary, marks the repugnance between the ideas com¬
pared ; in which cafe a negative particle muft be call¬
ed in, to ihow that the connexion included in the
copula does not take place.
vk Hence we fee the reafon of the rule commonly
laid down by logicians, lhat in all negative propoli-
tions the negation ought to affedl the copula. For as
the copula, when placed by itfelf, between the fubjedt
and the predicate, manifeilly binds them together ; it
is evident, that in order to render a propofition ne¬
gative, the particles of negation muft enter it in fuch
a manner as to deftroy this union. In a wTord, then
only are two ideas disjoined in a propofition, when the
negative particle may be fo referred to the copula, as
to break the affirmation included in it, and undo that
connexion it would otherwife eftablilh. When we
fay, for inftance, No man is perfeSl ; take away the
negation, and the copula of itfelf plainly unites the
ideas in the propofition. But as this is the very reverfe
of what is intended, a negative mark is added, to ffiow
that this union does not here take place. The nega¬
tion, therefore, by deftroying the effedt of the copula,
changes the very nature of the propofition, infomuch
that, inftead of binding two ideas together, it denotes
their feparation. On the contrary, in this fentence,
Phe man who departs not from an upright behaviour is
beloved of God, the predicate beloved of God is evidently
affirmed of the fubjedl an upright man : fo that, not-
withftanding the negative particle, the propofition is
itill affirmative. The reafon is plain : the negation
here affedls not the copula ; but, making properly a
part of the fubjedl, ferves, with other terms in the fen-
Part II,
Of

I* The next confiderable divifion of propofitions is Diviiion of
into univerfal and particular. Our ideas, according to ProP°fi-
what has been already obferved in the Firft Part, are tlo-ns ^
all lingular as they enter the mind, and reprefent in-“nd nS-
dividual objedls. But as by abftradlion we can render cular.
them univerlal, fo as to comprehend a whole clafs of
things, and fometimes feveral claffes at once ; hence
the terms expreffing thefe ideas muft be in like man¬
ner univerfal. If therefore w'e fuppofe any general
term to become the fubjedt of a propofition, it is evi¬
dent, that whatever is affirmed of the abftradt idea
belonging to that term, may be affirmed of all the in¬
dividuals to which that idea extends. Thus, when we
fay, Men are mortal; we confider mortality, not as
confined to one or any number of particular men, but
as wffiat may be affirmed without reftridfion of the
wffiole fpecies. By this means the propofition becomes
as general as the idea which makes the fubjedl of it ;
and indeed derives its univerfality entirely from that
idea, being more or leis fo according as this may be
extended to more or fewer individuals. But it is fur¬
ther to be obferved of thefe general terms, that they
fometimes enter a propofition in their full latitude, as in
the example given above ; and fometimes appear with
a mark of limitation. In this laft cafe we are given to
underftand, that the predicate agrees not to the whole
univerfal idea, but only to a part of it ; as in the pro¬
pofition, Some men are wife : For here wifdom is not
affirmed of every particular man, but reftrained to a
few of the human fpecies (b).
II. Now from this different appearance of the ge-Propofi-
neral idea that conftitutes the fubjedt of any judge-hons uni-
ment, arifes the divifion of propofitions into unive/ffaP
and particular. An univerfal propofition is that where- is f0 With¬
in the fubjedt is fome general term taken in its full la- out a mark
titude ; infomuch that the predicate agrees to all the °f reftric-.
individuals comprehended under it, if it denotes a
tion-
proper fpecies ; and to all the feveral fpecies, and
their individuals, if it marks an idea of a higher order.
The words all, every, no, none, &c. are the proper
figns of this univerfality ; and as they feldom fail to
accompany general truths, fo they are the moft obvi¬
ous criterion whereby to diftinguifii them. AH ani¬
mals have a power of beginning motion. This is an
univerfal propofition ; as w« know from the wmrd all
prefixed to the fubjedl animals, which denotes that it
muft be taken in its full extent. Hence the powder of
beginning motion may be affirmed of all the feveral
fpecies of animals. ^

1 v J fpecies, or to one or more of the fpecies belonging to
any genus, and not to the whole univerfal idea. Thus,
Some Jlones are heavier than iron ; Some men have an
uncommon Jhare of prudence. In the laft of thefe propo¬
rtions, the fubjed fome men implies only a certain num¬
ber of individuals, comprehended under a Angle fpecies.
In the former, where the fubjed is a genus that ex¬
tends to a great variety of diftind dalles, fome Jlones
may not only imply any number of particular Hones,
but alfo feveral whole fpecies of Hones, inafmuch as
there may be not a few with the property there de-
feribed. Hence we fee, that a propoiition does not
ceafe to be particular by the predicate’s agreeing to a
whole fpecies, unlefs that fpecies, fmgly and diilind-
ly conlidered, makes alfo the fubjed of which we af-
38 firm or deny.
Singular IV. There is Hill one fpecies of propofitions that
proportions rema-ms to ke deferibed, and which the more deferves
under The our notice> as is not yet agreed among logicians to
headof1C which of the two claffes mentioned above they ought
particulars, to be referred j namely, fngular propofitions, or thofe
where the fubjed is an individual. Of this nature are
the following : Sir Ifaac Newton was the inventor of
fluxions ; This book contains many ufeful truths. What
occalions ibme difficulty as to the proper rank of thefe
propofitions is, that, the fubjed being taken according
to the whole of its extenfion, they fometimes have
the fame effed in reafoning as univerfals. But T it
be confidered that they are in truth the moH limited
kind of particular propofitions, and that no propofition
- can with any propriety be called univerfal but where
the fubjed is fome univerfal idea j we fiiall not be long
in determining to which clafs they ought to be refer¬
red. When we fay, Some boohs contain ufeful truths;
the propofition is particular, becaufe the general term
appears with a mark of reftridion. If therefore we
fay, This book contains ufeful truths ; it is evident that
the propofition mufi be Hill more particular, as the li¬
mitation implied in the word this, is of a more confin¬
ed nature than in the former cafe.

intoTlfen-3 What may be affirmed of them at one time, cannot
tial and ac-often at another*, and it makes no fmall part of our
cidental. knowledge to diHinguiffi rightly thefe variations, and
trace the reafons upon wffiich they depend. For it is
obfervable, that amidft all the viciflitudes of nature,
fome things remain conHant and invariable *, nor even
-are the changes, to which we fee others liable, effed-
cd but in confequence of uniform and Heady laws,
*41
which, when known, are fufficient to dired us in our
judgements about them. Hence philofophers, in di-
ftinguifhing the objeds of our perception into various
claffes, have been very careful to note, that fome
properties belong effentially to the general idea, fo as
not to be feparable from it but by deHroying its very
nature j while others are only accidental, and may be
affirmed or denied of it in

may be reduced to a fine powder, and that an intenfe

II. From this diverfity in the feveral qualities offence a
things arifes a confiderable difference as to the man- diver-
ner of our judging about them. For all fuch proper-plty jn our
ties as are infeparable from objeds when confidered manner af
as belonging to any genus or fpecies, are affirmed ab-jndging.
folutely and without referve of that general idea.
Thus we fay, Gold is very weightij ; AJlone is hard;
Animals have a power of felf-motwn. But in the cafe-
of mutual or accidental qualities, as they depend up¬
on fome other confideration difiind from the general
idea \ that alfo muff be taken into the account, in or¬
der to form an accurate judgement. Should we affirm,
for inflance, of fome Hones, that they are very fuf-
ceptible of a rolling motion 5 the propofition, while it
remains in this general form, cannot with any advan¬
tage be introduced into our reafonings. An aptnefs
to receive that mode of motion flows from the figure
of the Hone ; which, as it may vary infinitely, our
judgement then only becomes applicable and determi¬
nate, when the particular figure, of which volubility is
a confequence, is alfo taken into the account. Let us
then bring in this other qonfideration, and the propo¬
fition will run as follows : Stones of a fpherical form are
eaflly put into a rolling motion. Here we fee the condition
upon which the predicate is affirmed, and therefore
know in what particular cafes the propofition may be
applied. _ _ r42
III. This confideration of propofitions refpeding the Which
manner in which the predicate is affirmed of the fub-gwesnfe
jedt gives rife to the divifion of them into abfolute an(i
conditional. Abfolute propofitions are thofe wherein pofitions ;n_
we affirm fome property infeparable from the idea of to abfolute
the fubjedf, and which therefore belongs to it in all and condi-
poffible cafes : as, God is infinitely wife ; Virtue tends^-10^'
to the ultimate happinefs of man. But where the predi¬
cate is not neceffarily connedfed with the idea of the
fubjed!, unlefs upon fome confideration diflindl from
that idea, there the propofition is called conditional.
The reafon of the name is taken from the fuppofition
annexed, which is of the nature of a condition, and may
be expreffed as fuch, thus : If a fone is expofed to the
rays of the fun, it will covtraB Jome degree of heat ; If
a river runs in a very declining channel, its rapidity will
confantly increafe.
IV. There is not any thing of greater importance'rlie great
in philofophy than a due attention to this divifion ofunportance
propofitions. If we are careful never to affirm things

happy in their difcoveries, and that what they demon-

And^redu- The truth of it is, particular propofitions are

from par- nexion with univerfals j and it is accordingly the great

the great advantage arifing from determining with
care the conditions upon which one idea may be af¬
firmed or denied of another is this : that thereby par¬
ticular propofitions really become univerfal, may be
introduced with certainty into our reafonings, and
ferve as flandards to condudt and regulate our judge¬

fay, Some water aBs very forcibly ; the propofition is
particular : and as the conditions on which this for¬

certain in what cafes it may be applied. Let us then
fupply thefe conditions, and the propofition will run
thus: Water conveyed in fujfcient quantity along a feep
defcent aBs very forcibly. Here we have an univerfal
judgement, inafmuch as the predicate forcible aBion
may be afcribed to all water under the circumftances

Dmfion ot Hitherto we have treated of propofitions, where
tions into onty two ideas are compared together. Thefe are in
Ample and the general called fimple; becaufe, having but one fub-
eompound. je£t and one predicate, they are the eflfedt of a fimple
judgement that admits of no fubdivifion. But if it fo
happens that feveral ideas offer themfelves to our
thoughts at once, whereby we are led to affirm the
fame thing of different objefts, or different things of
the fame objeft $ the propofitions expreffing thefe
judgements are called compound: becaufe they may be
refolved into as many others as there are fubjedts or
predicates in the whole complex determination on the
mind. Thus, God is infinitely wife and infinitely power¬
ful. Here there are two predicates, infinite wifdom and
infinite power, both affirmed of the fame fubjedt; and
accordingly -the propofition may be rcfolved into two
others j affirming thefe predicates feverally. In like
manner in the propofition, Neither kings nor people are
exempt from death ; the predicate is denied of both fub-
jedts, and may therefore be feparated from them in di-
ftindt propofitions. Nor is it lefs evident, that if a com¬
plex judgement confiils of feveral fubjedts and predi¬
cates, it may be refolved into as many fimple propofi¬
tions as are the number of different ideas compared
together. Riches and honours are apt to elate the mind,
and increafe the number of our defires. In this judge¬
ment there are two fubjedts and two predicates, and it
is at the fame time apparent that it may be refolved
into four diltindt propofitions. Riches are apt to elate

and one predicate; for the complex expreffion, A

per fubjedt of this propolition, and is no more than
one determined idea. 1 he fame thing happens in
caufals. Rehoboam was unhappy becaufe he followed evil
counfel There is here an appearance of two propo¬
fitions arifing from the complexity of the expreffion j
but when u’e come to confider the matter more near¬
ly, it is evident that we have but a fingle iubjedt and
predicate. The purfuit of evil counfel brought mifery
upon Rehoboam. It is not enough, therefore, to render
a propofition compound, that the fubjedt and predicate
are complex notions, requiring fometimes a whole len¬
ience to exprefs them : for in this cafe the comparifon
is ftill confined to two ideas, and conftitutes what we
call a fimple judgement. But where there are feveral
fubjedts or predicates, or both, as the affirmation or
negation may be alike extended to them all, the propo¬
fition expreffing fuch a judgement is truly a collediion
of as many fimple ones as there are different ideas com¬
pared. Confining ourfelves therefore to this more
ftridt and juft notion of compound propofitions, they
are all reducible to two kinds, viz. copulatives and dif-
jun&ives. ^
III. A. copulative propofition is, where the fubjedts Compound
and predicates are fo linked together, that they may propofm-
be all feverally affirmed or denied one of another. O^co^uktivT
this nature are the examples of compound propofitions ^ ’
given above. Riches and honours are apt to elate the
mind, and increafe the number of our defires. Neither
kings nor people are exempt from death. In the firft of
thefe the two predicates may be affirmed feverally of
each fubjedt, whence we have four diitindt propofitions.
The other furniffies an example of the negative kind,
where the fame predicate, being disjoined from both
fubjedts, may be alfo denied of them in feparate pro¬
pofitions.
IV. The other fpecies of compound propofitions are or disjunc-
thofe called disjundtives j in wffiicb, comparing feveral
predicates with the fame fubjedt, we affirm that one
of them neceffarily belongs to it, but leave the parti¬
cular predicate undetermined. If any one, for example,
fays, This world either exifis of if elf, or is the work of
fome all-wife and powerful caufe, it is evident that one
of the two predicates muft belong to the worldq but
as the propofition determines not which, it is therefore
of the kind we call dijunBive. Such too are the fol¬
lowing : The fun either moves round the earth, or is the
centre about which the earth revolves. Friendfhip finds
men equal, or makes them fo. It is the nature of all pro¬
pofitions of this clafs, fuppofing them to be exadl in
point of form, that upon determining the particular
predicate, the j;eft: are of courfe to be removed : or if

Chap. VI. Of the Divifion of Propoftions into Self-evi¬
dent and Demonf table.
Pro .oiki any propofition is offered to the view of
onsdivided the mind, if the terms in which it is expreffed be
into felf- underftood } upon comparing the ideas together, the
evident and agreement or difagreement afferted is either immedi-
dt monftra- aj.e]y perceived, or found to lie beyond the prefent
reach of the underftanding. In the firft cafe the pro-
polition is faid to be felf-evident, and admits not of
any proof, becaufe a bare attention to the ideas them-
felves produces full convidlion and certainty ; nor is
it poffible to call in any thing more evident by way of
confirmation. But where the connexion or repug¬
nance comes not fo readily under the infpedlion of the
mind, there we muft have recourfe to reafoning j
and if by a clear feries of proofs we can make out the
truth propofed, infomuch that felf-evidence (hall ac¬
company every ftep of the procedure, we are then
able to demonftrate what we affert, and the propofi¬
tion itfelf is faid to be demonf table. When we affirm,
for inftance, that it is impojfible for the fame thing to be
and not to be; whoever underftands the terms made
ufe of perceives at firft glance the truth of what is af¬
ferted, nor can he by any efforts bring himfelf to be¬
lieve the contrary. The propofition therefore is felf-
evident, and fuch that it is impoflible by reafoning to
make it plainer*, becaufe there is no truth more ob¬
vious or better known, from which as a confequence
it may be deduced. But if we fay, This world had a
beginning; the affertion is indeed equally true, but
Ihines not forth with the fame degree of evidence.
We find great difficulty in conceiving how the world
could be made out of nothing : and are not brought
to a free and full confent, until by reafoning we ar¬
rive at a clear view of the abfurdity involved in the
contrary funpofition. Hence this propofition is of tne
kind we call demonf table, inafmuch as its truth is not
immediately perceived by the mind, but yet may be
made appear by means of others more known and
obvious, whence it follows as an unavoidable confe-
quence.
50 II. From what has been faid, it appears, that reafon-
Self-evi- ing Js employed only about demonftrable propofitions,
and that our intuitive and felf-evident perceptions are
principles the ultimate foundation on which it .refts.

ts- ciples of reafoning ) and it is certain, that if in our
refearches we employ only fuch principles as have
this charadfer of felf-evidence, and apply them accord-jUI Sc^men *
ing to the rules to be afterwards explained, we {ball
be in no danger of error in advancing from one dif-
covery to another. For this we may appeal to the
writings of the mathematicians, which, being conduc¬
ed by the exprefs model here mentioned, are an incon-
tellable proof of the • firmnefs and liability of human
knowffedge, when built upon fo fure a foundation. For
not only have the propofitions of this fcience flood the
tell of ages 5 but are found attended with that invinci¬
ble evidence, as forces the affent of all who duly con-
fider the proofs upon which they are eilablilhed. Since
the mathematicians are univerfally allowed to have hit
upon the right method of arriving at unknown truths,
lince they have been the happieft in the choice as well
as the application of their principles, it may not be
amifs to explain here their method of Hating felf-evi¬
dent propofitions, and applying them to the purpofes of
demonftration. 51
IV. Firft then it is to be obferved, that they have Definitions
been very careful in afcertaining their ideas, and fix-f&reat
ing the fignification of their terms. For this purpofe
they begin with definitions, in which the meaning ofancievi_
their wrords is fo diftinftly explained, that they can-dence in
not fail to excite in the mind of an attentive reader knowledge'
the very fame ideas as are annexed to them by the
writer. And indeed the clearnefs and irrefiftible evi¬
dence of mathematical knowledge is owing to nothing
fo much as this care in laying the foundation. Where
the relation between any two ideas is accurately and
juftly traced, it will not be difficult for another to com¬
prehend that relation, if in fetting himfelf to difcover
it he brings the very fame ideas into comparifon. But
if, on the contrary, he affixes to his w'ords ideas dif¬
ferent from thofe that were in the mind of him wffio
firft advanced the demonftration ; it is evident that as
the fame ideas are not compared, the fame relation
cannot fubfift, infomuch that a propofition will be re-
jedled as falfe, wffiich, had the terms been rightly un¬
derftood, mull have appeared inconteftably true. A
fquare, for inftance, is a figure bounded by four equal
right lines, joined together at right angles. Here the
nature of the angles makes no lefs a part of the idea
than the equality of the fides : and many properties
demonftrated of the fquare How entirely from its being
a reclangular figure. If therefore we fuppofe a man,
who has formed a partial notion of a fquare, compre¬
hending only the equality of its fides, without regard
to the angles, reading fome demonftration that implies
alfo this latter confideration •, it is plain he would re-
je6l it as not univerfally true, inafmuch as it could not
be applied where the fides were joined together at
equal angles. For this laft figure, anfwering ftill to his
idea of a fquare, would be yet found without the pro¬
perty affigned to it in the propofition. But if he
comes afterwards to corredl his notion, and render his
idea complete, he will then readily own the truth and 52
juftnefs of the demonftration. ticians'^by
V. We fee, therefore, that nothing contributes fo beginning
much to the improvement and certainty of human with them
knowledge, as the having determinate ideas, andPro<jurea

courfes and reafonings about them. And on this ac-the truths

The efta-

always begin by defining tbeir terms, and diftindlly un¬
folding the notions they are intended to exprefs.
Hence fuch as apply themfelves to thefe dudies have
exactly the fame views of things : and, bringing al*
ways the very fame ideas into comparifon, readily dif-
cern the relations between them. It is likevvile of
importance, in every demonftration, to exprefs the fame
idea invariably by the fame word. From this praftice
mathematicians never deviate •, and if it be neceffary in
their demonftrations, where the reader’s comprehenfion
is aided by a diagram, it is much more fo in all reaion-
ings about moral or intelleftual truths where the ideas
cannot be reprefented by a diagram. The obfervation
of this rule may fometimes be produffive of ill-found¬
ing periods •, but when truth is the object, found ought
to be defpifed.
VI. When the mathematicians have taken this firft
flep, and made known the ideas whofe relations they
the fecond intend to inveftigate •, their next care is, to lay down
ftep in ma- fome felf-evident truths, which may ferve as a founda-
thematical tion for their future reafonings. And here indeed
knowledge, proceed with remarkable circurtifpeftion, admit¬
ting no principles but what flow immediately from
their definitions, and neceflarily force themfelves upon
a mind in any degree attentive to its ideas. Thus a
circle is a figure formed by a right line moving round
fome fixed point in the fame plane. The fixed point
round which the line is fuppofed to move, and where
one of its extremities terminates, is called the centre of
the circle. The other extremity, which is conceived
to be carried round until it returns to the point whence
it firfl: fet out, deferibes a curve running into itfelf, and
termed the circumference. All right lines drawn from
the centre to the circumference are called radii. From
thefe definitions compared, geometricians derive this
felf-evident truth ; that the radii of the fame circle are
54 all equal to one another.
Propofi- VII We now obferve, that in all propofitions we
tions divi- cither affirm or deny fome property of the idea that
culadve andcon^tutes t^ie fabjef! of our judgement, or we maintain
practical. t^lat fomething may be done or effedfed. The firft fort
are called fpecu/ative propofitions, as in the example
mentioned above, the radii of the fame circle are all
equal one to another. The others are called praBical, for
a reafon too obvious to be mentioned j thus, that a right
line may be drawn from one point to another is a pradti-
cal propofition •, inafmuch as it expreffed that fome¬
thing may be done.
VIII. From this twofold confideration of propofi¬
tions arifes the twofold divifion of mathematical prin-
diftinguifh- ciples into axioms and poftulates. By an axiom they
edintoaxi- underftand any felf-evident fpeculative truth •, as, That
oms and the whole is greater than its parts : That things equal to
poftulates, one Qny (jie jame thing are equal to one another. But a
felf-evident pradfical propofition is wThat they call a
pojlulate. Such are thofe of Euclid j that a finite right
line may be continued dire&ly forwards ; that a circle
may be deferibed about any centre with any diftance.
And here we are to obferve, that as in an axiom the
-agreement or difagreement between the fubjedt and pre-

thing aflerted muft be evident at firft view, but alfo
the manner in which it may be effedled. For where
this manner is not of itfelf apparent, the propofition
comes under the notion of the demonftrable kind and
is treated as fuch by geometrical writers. Thus, to
draw a right line from one point to another, is affumed
by Euclid as a poftulaie, becaufe the manner of doing
it is fo obvious, as to require no previous teaching.
But then it is not equally evident, how we are to con-
ftrudt an equilateral triangle. For this reafon he ad¬
vances it as a demonftrable propofition, lays down rules
for the exadt performance, and at the fame time proves,
that if thefe rules are follow’ed, the figure will be juftly
deferibed. $6
IX. This leads us to take notice, that as felf-evident and demon-
truths are diftinguiilicd into different kinds, according Pro*
as they are fpeculative or pradlical *, fo is it alfo w'tbtoth0
demonftrable propofitions. A demonftrable fpecula- and pro-*
tive propofition is by mathematicians called a theorem, blem;.
Such is the famous 47th propofition of the firft book
of the Elements, known by the name of the Pythago-
ric theorem, from its fuppofed inventor Pythagoras,
viz. “ that in every right-angled triangle, the fquare
deferibed upon the fide fubtending the right angle is
equal to both the fquares deferibed upon the fides con¬
taining the right angle.” On the other hand, a de¬
monftrable pradlical propofition is called a problem ; as
wdiere Euclid teaches us to deferibe a fquare upon a
given right line. ^
X. It may not be amifs to add, that, befides the Corollaries
four kinds of propofitions already mentioned, mathe- are obvious]
maticians have alfo a fifth, known by the name of^^^®”5
corollaries. Thefe are ufually fubjoined to theorems orremsorpro
problems, and differ from them only in this: that they blems,
flow from what is there demonftrated in fo obvious a
manner as to difeover their dependence upon the pro¬
pofition whence they are deduced, almoft as foon as
propofed. Thus Euclid having demonftrated, “ that
in every right-lined triangle all the three angles taken
together are equal to two right angles j” adds by way
of corollary, “ that all the three angles of any one tri¬
angle taken together are equal to all the three angles
of any other triangle taken together : which is evi¬
dent at firll fight; becaufe in all cafes they are equal
to two right ones, and things equal to one and the fame
thing are equal to one another.
XI. The fcholia of mathematicians are/ indifferently scholia
annexed to definitions, propofitions, or corollaries j ferve the
and anfwer the fame purpofes as annotations upon a purpofes of

IT often happens in comparing ideas together, that
their agreement or difagreement cannot be difcerned
at firil view, efpecially if they are of fuch a nature as
not to admit of an exaft application one to another.
When> for inftance, we compare two figures of a de¬
lations dif- ferent make, in order to judge of their equality or in-
covered by equality, it is plain, that by barely confidering the fi-
means of gures themfelves, we cannot arrive at an exadl deter-
diatehieas. m>nat;on j becaufe, by reafon of their difagreeing forms,
’ it is impofiible fo to put them together, as that their
feveral parts {hall mutually coincide. Here then it be¬
comes neceffary to look out for fome third idea that
wull admit of fuch an application as the prefent cafe
requires ; wherein if we fucceed, all difficulties vanifli,
and the relation we are in quell of may be traced, with
eafe. Thus, right-lined figures are all reduced to
fquares, by means of which we can meafure their areas,
and determine exadlly their agreement or difagreement
in point of magnitude.
II. But how can any third idea ferve to difcover a
- relation between two others ? The anfwer is, By be¬
ing compared feverally with thefe others ; for fuch a
ed'rea1611”" comPar^on enables us to fee how far the ideas with
which this third is compared are conne&ed or disjoin¬
ed between themfelves. In the example mentioned
above of two right-lined figures, if we compare each of
them with fome fquare whofe area is known, and find
the one exaflly equal to it, and the other lefs by a
fquare inch, we immediately conclude that the area of
the firft figure is a fquare inch greater than that of the
fecond. This manner of determining the relation be¬
tween any two ideas, by the intervention of fome
third with which they may be compared, is that which
we call reafoning; and is indeed the chief inftrument
by which we pufli on our difcoveries, and enlarge our
knowledge. The great art lies in finding out fuch in¬
termediate ideas, as when compared with the others in
the queftion, will furnifh evident and known truths j
becaufe, as will afterwards appear, it is only by means
of them that w?e arrive at the knowledge of wffiat is
hidden and remote.
III. Hence it appears, that every acl of reafoning
that confti- neceffarily includes three diftindl judgements ; two
tutc an act wherein the ideas whofe relation wTe want to diicover
are feverally compared with the middle idea, and a
third wherein they are themfelves connected or disjoin¬
ed, according to the refult of that companion. Now,
as in the fecond part of logic, our judgements, when put
into words, w7ere called propofitions, fo here in the
third part the expreffions of our reafonings are termed
fijllogifms. And hence it follows, that as every aft of
reafoning implies three feveral judgements, fo every fyl-
loglfm muft include three diftinft propofitions. When
a icafoning is thus put into words, and appears in form
of a fyllogifm, the intermediate idea made ufe of, to
dfifeover the agreement or difagreement we fearch for,
VpL. XII. Part I.

is called the middle term ; and the two ideas themfelves
with which this third is compared, go by the name of
the extremes. 6z
VI. But as thefe things are bed illuftrated by ex-rndanc^.
amples $ let us, for inftance, fet ourfelves to inquire
whether men are accountable for their adiions. As the abienefi.
relation between the ideas of tnan and accountablenefs,
comes not within the immediate view of the mind,
our firft care muft be to fifid out fome third idea that
will enable us the more eafily to difcover and trace it.
A very fmall meafure of refleftion is fufficient to in¬
form us, that no creature can be accountable for his
aftions, unlefs we fuppofe him capable of diftinguifti-
ing the good from the bad •, that is, unlefs wre fuppofe
him poffeffed of reafon. Nor is this alone fufficient.
For what would it avail him to know good from bad
aftions, if he had no freedom of choice, nor could
avoid the one and purfue the other ? hence it becomes
neceffary to take in both confiderations in the prefent
cafe. It is at the fame time equally apparent, that
wherever there is ability of diftinguiffiing good from
bad aftions, and of purfuing the one and avoiding the
other, there alfo a creature is accountable. We have
then got a third idea, with which accountablenefs is
infeparably connefted, viz. reafon and liberty which
are here to be confidered as making up one complex
conception. Let us now take this middle idea, and
compare it with the other term in the queftion, viz.
man, and we all know by experience that it may be
affirmed of him. Having thus by means of the inter¬
mediate idea formed two feveral judgements, viz. that
man is poffeffed of reafon and liberty ; and that reafon
and liberty imply acc&untablenefs ; a third obvioufly and
neceflarily follows, viz. that man is accountable for his
aBions. Here then we have a complete aft of reafon,-
ing, in which, according to what has been already ob-
ferved, there are three diftinft judgements: two thaf!
may be ftyled previous, inafmuch as they lead to the
other, and arife from comparing the middle idea with
the two ideas in the queftion : the third is a confe-
quence of thefe previous afts, and flows from combin¬
ing the extreme ideas between themfelves. If now
we put this reafoning into words, it exhibits what logi¬
cians term a fyllogifm j and, when propofed in due
form, runs thus :
“ Every creature poffeffed of reafon and liberty is
“ accountable for his aftions.
“ Man is a creature poffeffed of reafon and liberty :
“ Therefore man is accountable for his aftions.”
V. In this fyllogifm we may obferve, that there are Premifes,
three feveral p'ropofitions expreffing the three judge-c0nclull0n-
ments implied in the aft of reafoning 5 and fo difpo{ed,^J^es’
as to reprefent diftinftly what paffes within the mind in term,
tracing the more diftant relations of its ideas. The two
firft propofitions anfwer the two previous judgements
in reafoning, and are called the premifes, becaufe they
are placed before the other. The third is termed the
conclufon, as being gained in confequence of what was
afferted in the premifes. We are alfo to remember,
1' that
346 LOGIC* Part III.
Of that the terms exprefling the two ideas whole rela-
Reafonmg. tjons we inquire alter, as here man and accountab/e-
p.efs, are in general called the extremes ; and that the in¬
termediate idea, by means of which the relation is tra¬
ced, viz. a creature pojjejfed of recfon and liberty, takes
the name of the middle term. Hence it follows, that by
the premifes of a fyllogifm we are always to underftand
the two propofitions where the middle term is feverally
compared with the extremes; for thefe conllitute the
previous judgements, whence the truth we are in queft
of is by reafoning deduced. conclufion is that other
propofition, in which the extremes themfelves are joined
or feparated agreeably to what appears upon the above
comparifon.
Major and VI. The conclufion is made up of the extreme terms
minor term,of the fyllogifm : and the extreme, which ferves as the
major and predicate of the conclufion, goes by the name of the
pofition.10" TnaJor term '• the other extreme, which makes the fub-
je6l in the fame propofition, is called the minor term.
From this diftindHon of the extremes arifes alfo a di-
rtin&ion between the premifes, where thefe extremes
are feverally compared with the middle term. That
propofition which compares the greater extreme, or
the predicate of the conclufion, with the middle term,
is called the major propoftion : the other, wherein the
fame middle term is compared with the fubjedl of the
conclufion or Idler extreme, is called the minor propof¬
tion. All this is obvious from the fyllogifm already
given, where the conclufion is, Man is accountable for
his actions. For here the predicate accountable for his
adlions being connedled with the middle term in the
firft of the two premifes, every creature pojfeffed of rea-
fon and liberty is accountable for his aft ions, gives what
we call the major propoftion. In the fecond of the

we find the leffer extreme, or fubjedl of the conclu¬

a fyllogifm is propofed in due form, the major propo¬

they be of themfelves apparent to the underftanding,

them as foon as propofed. In the fyllogifm given
above, the premifes are fuppofed to be felf-evident
truths j otherwife the conclufion could not be inferred
by a fihgle adl of reafoning. If, for inflance, in the
major, every creature pojfeffed of reafon and liberty is ac¬
countable for his aflions, the connexion between the
fubjedl and predicate could not be perceived by a bare
attention to the ideas themfelves j it is evident that
this propofition would no lefs require a proof than the
conclufion deduced from it. In this cafe a new middle
term muft be fought for, to trace the connexion here
fuppofed $ and this of courfe furnilhes another fyllo¬
gifm, by which having eftabliftied the propofition in

third fyllogifm, in order to lay open that truth to the ' J
mind : becauie fo long as the premifes remain uncer¬
tain, the conclufion built upon them mull be fo too.
When, by condudling our thoughts in this manner,
we at laft arrive at fome fyllogifm where the previous
propofitions are intuitive truths j the mind then refts in
full fecurity, as perceiving that the feveral conclufions it
has pafied through ftand upon the immoveable founda¬
tion of felf-evidence, and when traced to their fource ter¬
minate in it. gtf
VIII. We fee, therefore, that in order to infer aReafoiaingy
conclufion by a fingle adl of reafoning, the premifesm ^
muft be intuitive propofitions. Where they are not,
previous fyllogifms are required •, in which cafe rea- concatena-
foning becomes a complicated adl, taking in a variety tion of fyL
of fucceflive fteps. This frequently happens in tra-loSifi:ns*
cing the more remote relation of our ideas; where,
many middle terms being called in, the conclufion can¬
not be made out but in confequence of a feries of fyl¬
logifms following one another in train. But although
in this concatenation of propofitions, thofe that form
the premifes of the laft fyllogifm are often confider-
ably removed from felf-evidence j yet if we trace the
reafoning backwards, we {hall find them the conclufions
of previous fyllogifms, whofe premifes approach nearer
and nearer to intuition in proportion as we advance,
and are found at laft to terminate in it. And if, af¬
ter having thus unravelled a demonftration, we take it
the contrary way j and obferve how the mind, fetting
out with intuitive perceptions, couples them together
to form a concluuon : how, by introducing this con¬
clufion into another fyllogifm, it ftill advances one
ftep farther j and fo proceeds, making every new dif-
covery fubfervient to its future progrefs j wre (hall
then perceive clearly, that reafoning, in the higheft
fenfe of that faculty, is no more than an orderly com¬
bination of thofe fimple adls which we have already fo
fully explained. ^
IX. Thus we fee, that reafoning, beginning with Requires
firft principles, rifes gradually from one judgement to intuitive
another, and conne6ls them in fuch manner, that every certai,^Yia*
ftage of the progreflion brings intuitive certainty along
with it. And now at length wre may clearly under-greflion.
ftand the definition given above of this diftinguifhing
faculty of the human mind. Reafon, we have faid, is
the ability of deducing unknown truths from principles
or propofitions that are already known. This evi¬
dently appears by the foregoing account, where we
fee that no propofition is admitted into a fyllogifm, to
ferve as one of the previous judgements on which the
conclufion refts, unlefs it is itfelf a known and efta-
blilhed truth, whofe connexion with felf-evident prin¬
ciples has been already traced.

mined whether they are comprehended under that ge¬
neral idea of which the property is affirmed. Thus
there are certain properties belonging to all even num¬
bers, which neverthelefs cannot be applied to any par¬
ticular number, until we have firft difcovered it to be
of the fpecies expreffed by that natural name. _ Hence
reafoning begins with referring things to their feve-
ral divifions and claffes in the fcale of our ideas j and
as thefe divifions are all diftinguiffied by particular
names, we hereby learn to apply the terms expreffing
general conceptions to fuch particular objects as come
under our immediate obfervation.
III. Now, in order to arrive at thefe conclufions, by
which the feveral objefts of perception are brought un¬
der general names, two things are manifeftly n5<^eJ"
fary. Firft, That we take a view of the idea itfelt
denoted by that general name, and carefully attend to
the diftinguiffiing marks which ferve to charaftenze
it. Secondly, That we compare this idea with the
objecT under confideration, obferving diligently where¬
in they agree or differ. If the idea is found to corre-
fpond with the particular objeft, we then without he-
fitation apply the general name ; but if no fuch corre-
fpondence intervenes, the conclufion muft neceifanly
take a contrary turn. Let us, for inftance, take the
number eight, and confider by what fteps we are led
to pronounce it an even number. Firft then, we call
to mind the idea fignified by the expreffion an even
number, viz. that it is a number divifible into two equal
parts. 'We then compare this idea with the number
eight, and finding them manifeftly to agree, fee at
once the neceffity of admitting the conclufion. Thefe
feveral judgements therefore transferred into language,
and reduced to the form of a fyllogifm, appear thus:
“ Every number that may be divided into two equal
“ parts is an even number :
« The number eight may be divided into two equal
“ parts ‘j
“ Therefore the number eight is an even number.
IV. Here it may be obferved, that where the ge¬
neral idea, to which particular objefts are referred, is
very familiar to the mind, and frequently in view 5
this reference, and the application of the general
name, feem to be made without any apparatus of rea¬
foning. When we fee a horfe in the fields, a dog
in the ftreet, we readily apply the name of the fpe¬
cies •, habit, and a familiar acquaintance with the ge¬
neral idea, fuggefbng it irtftantaneoufly to the mind.
We are not however to imagine on this account that
the undemanding departs from the ufual rules of juft
thinking. A frequent repetition of a6ts begets a ha¬
bit ; and habits are attended with a certain prompt-
nefs of execution, that prevents our obferving the fe¬
veral fteps and gradations by which any courfe of ac¬
tion is accompliffied. But in other inftances, where
GIG. H7
we judge not by precontraaed habits, as when the
general idea is very complex, or lefs familiar to the . ^ »
mind, we always proceed according to the form of
reafoning eftabliffied above. A goldimith, for inftance,
who is in doubt as to any piece of metal, whether it
be of the fpecies called gold, firft examines its proper¬
ties, and then comparing them with the general idea
fignified by that name, if he finds a perfeft correfpond-
ence, no longer hefitates under what clafs of metals to
rank it. -n, 1.
V. Nor let it be imagined that our refearches here,
becaufe in appearance bounded to the impofing of
neral names upon particular obje£ts, are therefore tri- kranch 0f
vial and of little confequence. Some of the moft con-reafoning;
fiderable debates among mankind, and fuch too as
nearly regard their lives, intereft, and happinefs, turn
wholly upon this article. Is it not the chief employ¬
ment of our feveral courts of judicature to determine
in particular inftances, what is law, juftice, and equity ?
Of what importance is it in many cafes to decide a-
right whether an aflion fhall be termed murder or
manjlaughter ? We fee then that no lefs than the. lives
and fortunes of men depend often upon thefe decilions.
The reafon is plain. A£tions, when once referred to
a general idea, draw after them all that fnay be af¬
firmed of that idea j infomuch that the determining
the fpecies of actions is all one with determining what
proportion of praife or difpraife, commendation 01
blame, &c. ought to follow them. For as it is allow'-
ed that murder deferves death ; by bringing any par¬
ticular aftion under the head of murder, we of courie
decide the puniffiment due to it. 73
tilt. ^ - - • »
VI. But the great importance of this branch of rea- ^‘he^ex-
foning, and the neceffity of care and c*5cum^Pe^°u Vance of it
in referring particular obje£ts to general ideas, is ftdl pradlifed by
farther evident from the pradlice of the matherm-ti- mathemati¬
cians. Every one who has read Euclid, knows, tha.tc^ans'
he frequently requires us to draw lines through certain
points, and according to fuch and fuch directions.
The figures thence refulting are often fquares, paral¬
lelograms, or redtangles. Yet Euclid never fuppou;s
this from their bare appearance, but always demon-
ftrates it upon the ftridteft principles of geometiy.
Nor is the method he takes in any thing different fiom
that defcribed above. Thus, for inftance, having de¬
fined a fquare to be a figure bounded by four equal
fides joined together at right angles •, when fuch a fi¬
gure arifes in any conftrudtion previous to the demon-
ftration of a propofition, yet he never calls it by tnat
name until he has iliown that its fides are equal, and
all its angles right ones. Now this is apparently the
fame form of reafoning we have before exhibited in
proving eight to be an even number. 74
VII. Having thus explained the rules by which we Fixed and
are to conduff ourfelves in ranking particular o.bjefts
under general ideas, and ffiown their conformity a fteaciy ap-

are perfefllv known to the mind, ana can be readily
diftiuguilhed upon occafion, there will be little danger

acquainted ourfelves with the feveral particulars ob-

tute fome general idea, framed and fettled before¬
hand by the underftanding, and difiinguifhed by a par¬
ticular name, the refemblance thus known and perceiv¬
ed neceffarily determines the fpecies of the objeft,
and thereby gives it a right to the name by which
, that fpecies is called. Thus four equal fides, joined
together at right angles, make up the notion of a
fquare. As this is a fixed and invariable idea, with¬
out which the general name cannot be applied 5 we ne¬
ver call any particular figure a fquare until it appears
to have thefe feveral conditions j and contrarily,
wherever a figure is found with thefe conditions, it
neceffarily takes the name of a fquare. The fame
will be found to hold in all our other reafonings of this
kind, where nothing can create any difficulty but the
want of fettled ideas. If, for infiance, we have not
determined within ourfelves the precife notion denot¬
ed by the wrord manflaughter, it will be impoffible for
us to decide wfficther any particular aftion ought to
bear that name : becaufe, however nicely wTe examine
the aflion itfelf, yet, being ftrangers to the general
idea wuth wffiich it is to be compared, wTe are utterly
unable to judge of their agreement or difagreement.
But if wTe take care to remove this obftacle, and di-
ftinflly trace the two ideas under confideration, all

VIII. Thus we fee of what importance it is towards
the improvement and certainty of human knowledge,
that we accuftom ourfelves to clear and determinate
ideas, and a fteady application of words.
Chap. III. Of Reafoning, as it regards the powers
and Properties of Things, and the Relations of our
general Ideas.
75
Thediftinc- I. We now come to the fecond great end which
tionofrea- men have in view in their reafonings •, namely, the
re^mls the” ^‘^cover’ng an'-l afcribing to thing-s their feveral attri-
fciences ^ ^utes an^ properties. And here it will be necefiary
and as it to diilinguifii between reafoning, as it regards the
concerns fciences, and as it concerns common life. In the fci-
common ences, our reafon is employed chiefly about univerfal
truths, it being by them alone that the bounds of hu¬
man knowledge are enlarged. Hence the divifion of
things into various claffes, called otherwife genera and
fpecies. For thefe univerfal ideas being fet up as the
reprefentatives of many particular things, whatever
is affirmed of them may be alfo affirmed of all the in¬
dividuals to which they belong. Murder, for inftance,
is a general idea, reprefenting a certain fpecies of hu¬
man a£lions. Reafon tells us that the puniffiment due
to it is death. Hence every particular adlion, coming
under the notion of murder, has the puniihment of
death allotted to it. Here then ive apply the general
truth to fome obvious inftance ; and this is what pro¬
perly conftitutes the reafoning of common life. For
men, in their ordinary tranfaflions and intercourfe
one with another, have, for the moft part, to do on¬
ly with particular objefls. Our friends and relations,
1 c. Pan 11 r.
their characters and behaviour, the confiitution of the Of
feveral bodies that furround us, and the ufes to wffiich ^ea^on^ng‘
they may be applied, are what chiefly engage our at- v f
tention. In all thefe, wre reafon about particular
things j and the whole refult of our reafoning is, the
applying the general truths of the fciences in the or¬
dinary tranfadions of human life. When we fee a
viper, we avoid it. Wherever we have occafion for
the forcible aCtion of w-ater to move a body that makes
confiderable refifiance, w’e take care to convey it in
fuch a manner that it flrall fall upon the objeCl with
impetuofity. Now all this happens in confequence of
our familiar and ready application of thefe two gene¬
ral truths. The bite of a viper is mortal. Water falling
upon a body with impetuofty, alls very forcibly towards
fetting it in motion. In like manner, if we fet ourfelves
to confider any particular charafter, in order to deter¬
mine the (hare of praife or difpraife that belongs to it,
our great concern is to afcertain exaclly the propor¬
tion of virtue and vice. The reafon is obvious. A
juft determination, in all cafes of this kind, depends
entirely upon an application of thefe general maxims
of morality : Virtuous actions deferve praife ; vicious ac¬
tions deferve blame. ^5
II. Hence it appears that reafoning, as it regards The fteps
common life, is no more than the afcribing the ge-fy’ which
neral properties of things to thofe feveral objefts with^j^0^5*
which we are more immediately concerned according fonino-0f "
as they are found to be of that particular divilion or common
clafs to which the properties belong. The fteps thenlife*
by which we proceed are manifeftly thefe. Firft, We
refer the object under confideration to fome general
idea or clafs of things. We then recoiled the feveral
attributes of that general idea. And, laftly, Afcribe
all thofe attributes to the prefent objed. Thus, in
confidering the charader of Sempronius, if we find it
to be of the kind called virtuous, when we at the fame
time refled that a virtuous charader is deferving of
efteem, it naturally and obvioufly follows that Sem¬
pronius is fo too. Thefe thoughts put into a fyllo-
gifm, in order to exhibit the form of reafoning here re¬
quired, run thus:
“ Every virtuous man is wrorthy of efteem.
“ Sempronius is a virtuous man :
“ Therefore Sempromus is worthy of efteem.”
III. By this fyllogifm it appears, that before we af-The con¬
firm any thing ot a particular objed, that objed mull nexion and
be referred to fome general idea. Sempronius is pvo-d^Pendence-
nounced worthy of efteem only in confequence of his°* llujtwo
being a virtuous man, or coming under that general branches of
notion. Hence wTe fee the neceffary connexion of the reafoning
various parts of reafoning, and the dependence theyoneuPon
have one upon another. The determining the generaanother’
and fpecies of things is, as we have faid, one exercife
of human reafon ; and here we find that this exercife
is the firft in order, and previous to the other, which
confifts in afcribing to them their powers, properties,
and relations. But wffien we have taken this previous
ftep, and brought particular objeds under general
names; as the properties we afcribe to them are no
other than thofe of the general idea, it is plain that,
in order to a fuccefsful progrefs in this part of knovv-

kinds: either fuch as immediately difeover themfelves,
upon comparing the ideas one with another } or fuch
as, being more remote and diilant, require art and
contrivance to bring them into view\. The relations
of the firft kind furnifh us with intuitive and felf-evi-
dent truths : thofe of the fecond are traced by reafon¬
ing, and a due application of intermediate ideas. . It
is of this laft kind that we are to fpeak here, having
defpatched what w^as neceffary with regard to the
other in the Second Part. As, therefore, in tracing the
more diflant relations of things, we mull always have
recourfe to intervening ideas, and are more or lefs
fuccefsful in our refearches according to our. acquaint¬
ance with thefe ideas, and ability of applying them
and it is evident, that to make a good reafoner, two
things are principally required. Fir/l, An extenfive
knowledge of thofe intermediate ideas, by means of
which things may be compared one with another.
Secondly, The fkill and talent of applying them hap¬
pily in all particular inflances that come under conli-
deration. _ .
V. In order to our fuccefsful progrefs in reafoning,
cAicimvt we mull have an extenlive knowledge of thofe inter¬
knowledge mediate ideas by means of which things may be com-
diateidTas Pared one with another. For as it is not every idea
that will anfwer the purpofe of our inquiries, but fuch
only as are peculiarly related to the objects about
which we reafon, fo as, by a comparifon. with them
to furnifh evident and known truths 5 nothing is more
apparent than that the greater variety of conceptions
we can call into view, the more likely we are ^to find
fome among them that will help us to the trutns here
required. And, indeed, it is found to hold in experi¬
ence, that in proportion as we enlarge our views .of
things, and grow acquainted with a multitude of uif-
ferent objedls, the reafoning faculty gathers ftrength :
for, by extending our fphere of knowledge, the mind
acquires a certain force and penetration, as being ac-
cuflomed to examine the feveral appearances of its
ideas, and obferve what light they caft one upon ano¬
ther.

markably in any one branch of learning, it is necefia-
ry to have at leaf! a general acquaintance with the
whole circle of arts and fciences. The truth of'it is.

But when our reafoning regards a particular fcience,an(ifcien-
it is farther neceffary that wTe more nearly acquainted,
ourfelves with whatever relates to that Icience. A
general knowledge is a good preparation, and enables
us to proceed with eafe and expedition in wThatever
branch of learning we apply to. But then, in the
minute and intricate queltions of any Icience, we are
by no means qualified to reafon with advantage until
•we have perfe&ly maftered the fcience to which they ^
bevn'. We come now to the fecond thing requir-Secoftdly,^
ed, in order to a fuccefsful progrels in realoning ; jniii
namely, the Ikill and talent of applying intermediate termediate
ideas happily in all particular inftances that come un- ideas hap-
der conlideration. And here, rules and precepts are; ' P'
of little fervice. Ufe and experience are the belt >
inltruclors. For, whatever logicians may boaft of
being able to form perfedl reafoners by book and rule,
we find by experience, that the ftudy of their pre¬
cepts does not always add any great degree of ftrength
to the underitanding. In Ihort, it is the habit alone
of reafoning that makes a reafoner. And. therefore
the true way to acquire this talent is, by being much
converfant in thofe Iciences wrhere the ait of reafon¬
ing is allowed to reign in the greateft perieflion.
Hence it was that the ancients, who fo well under-
ftood the manner of forming the mind, always began
with mathematics, as the foundation of their philo-
fophical ftudies. Here the underftanding is by de¬
grees habituated to truth, contrails infeniibly a cer¬
tain fondnefs for it, and learns never to yield its ai-
fent to any propofition but where the evidence is
fufficient to, produce full conviction. For this reafon
Plato has called mathematical demonftrations the ca-
thartics or purgatives of the foul, as being the pro¬
per means to cieanfe it from error, and reftore that
natural exercife of its faculties in which juft thinking
confifts. # 82
VIII. If therefore we would form our minds to a The ftudy
habit of reafoning . clofely and in train, we cannot
take any more certain method than the exerciling our-^n^.^
felves in mathematical demonftrations, fo as to contradt tions of
a kind of familiarity with them. Not that we look great avail
upon it as neceffary that all men ftiould be deep rna- re
thematicians j but that, having got the wjay of reafon- ^
ing which that ftudy neceffarily brings the mind to, ^
they may be able to transfer it to other parts of know-^s o£
ledge, as they ftiall have occafton. fuch au-
IX. But although the ftudy of mathematics be of all thors on
ethers the moft ufeful to form the mind and give it other fub-
an early relilh of truth, yet ought not other parts q^nguifti-
philofophy to be negledled. Far there alio w7e meet etj for
with many opportunities of exerciling the powers of ftrength

Of rally leads us to obferve all thofe different turns of
Reafoning. thinking that are peculiarly adapted to the feveral
v ideas we examine, and the truth we fearch after. A
mind thus trained acquires a certain mallery over its
own thoughts, infomuch that it can range and model
them at pleafure, and call fuch into view as beft fuit
its prefent defigns. Now in this the whole art of rea¬
foning confilis ; from among a great variety of differ¬
ent ideas to fingle out thofe that are moft proper for
the bufinefs in hand, and to lay them together in fuch
order, that from plain and eafy beginnings, by gentle
degrees, and a continued train of evident truths, we
may be infenfibly led on to fuch difeoveries, as at our
lirfl fetting out appeared beyond the reach of human
underflanding. For this purpofe, befides the iludy of
mathematics before recommended, we ought to apply
ourfelves diligently to the reading of fuch authors as
have diilinguifhed themfelves for ifrength of reafoning,
and a ji>ft and accurate manner of thinking. For it is
pbfervable, that a mind exercifed and feafoned to
truth, feldom refts fatisfied in a bare contemplation of
the arguments offered by others; but will be frequent¬
ly affaying its own ftrength, and purfuing its difeove-
ries upon the plan it is moft accuftomed to. Thus we
infenfibly contradl a habit of tracing truth from one
ftage to another, and of inveftigating thofe general
relations and properties which we afterwards aferibe to
particular things, according as we find them compre¬
hended under the abftraft ideas to which the proper¬
ties belong.

The figures I. Hitherto we have contented ourfelves with a
offyllo- general notion of fyllogifms, and of the parts of which
gifms.
is now time to enter a little more
particularly into the fubjedl, to examine their various
forms, and lay open the rules of argumentation pro¬
per to each. In the fyllogifms mentioned in the fore¬
going chapters, we may obferve, that the middle term
is the fubjeft of the major propofition, and the predi¬
cate of the minor. This difpofition, though the moft
natural and obvious, is not however neceffary j it fre¬
quently happening, that the middle term is the fub-
jedt in both the premifes, or the predicate in both;
and fometimes, diredlly contrary to its difpofition in
the foregoing chapters, the predicate in the major,
and the fubject in the minor. Hence the diftindiion
of fyllogifms into various kinds, fgures by logi¬
cians. For figure, according to their ufe of the word,
is nothing elfe but the order and difpofition of the
middle term in any fyllogifm. And as this difpofition
is, we fee, fourfold, fo the figures of fyllogifms thence
arifing are four in number. When the middle term is
the fubjedf of the major propofition, and the predicate
of the miner, we have what is called the frflfigure;
As,
“ No work of God is bad :
“ The natural paflions and appetites of men are
“ the work of God :
“ Therefore none of them is bad.”
If, on the other hand, it is the predicate of both the
premifes, the fyllogifm is faid to be the iecondfigure:
As,
I C. Part III.
“ Whatever is bad is not the work of God : Of
“ Therefore the natural paflions and appetites of
“ men are not bad.”
Again, In the third figure, the middle term is the fub-
jedt of the two premifes : As,
“ All Africans are black :
“ All Africans are men :
“ Therefore lome men are black.”
And laftly, By making it the predicate of the major,
and fubjefl of the minor, we obtain fyllogifms in the
fourth figure; As,
“ The only Being wrho ought to be worftiipped is
“ the Creator and Governor of the wTorld :
“ The Creator and Governor of the wTorld is
“ God :
“ Therefore God is the only Being who ought to
** be worflnpped.” ^
II. But, befides this fourfold diftinflion of fyllo-The moqils
gifms, there is alfo a farther fubdivifion of them inof tyllQ'
every figure, arifing from the quantity and quality, as*
they are called, of the propofitions. By quantity we
mean the confideration of propofitions, as univerfal or
particular j by quality, as affirmative or negative.
Now aSj in all the feveral difpofitions of the middle
term, the propofitions of which a fyllogifm confifts
may be either univerfal or particular, affirmative or
negative $ the due determination of thefe, and fo put¬
ting them together as the law's of argumentation re¬
quire, conftitute what logicians call the moods of fyllo¬
gifms. Of thefe moods there is a determinate num¬
ber to every figure, including all the poflible ways in
which propofitions differing in quantity or quality can
be combined, according to any difpofition of the mid¬
dle term, in order to arrive at a juft conclufion.
The firft figure has only four legitimate moods.
The major propofition in this figure muft be univerfal,
and the minor affirmative j and it has this property,
that it yields conclufions of all kinds, affirmative and
negative, univerfal and particular.
The fecond figure has alfo four legitimate moods.
Its major propofition muft be univerfal, and one of the
premifes muft be negative. It yields conclufions both
univerfal and particular, but all negative.
The third figure has fix legitimate moods. Its mi¬
nor muft always be affirmative 5 and it yields conclu¬
fions both affirmative and negative, but ail particular.
——Thefe are all the figures which were admitted by
the inventor of fyllogifms, and of which, fo far as we
know', the number of legitimate moods has been af-
certained, and fevepally demonftrated. In every figure
it will be found upon trial, that there zxz fixty four dif¬
ferent moods of fyllogifm •, and he w ho thinks it w orth
while to conftrucl fo many in the fourth figure, always
remembering that the middle term in each muft be the
predicate of the major and the fubjeci of the minor pro¬
pofition, will eafily difeern wffiat number of thefe moods
are legitimate, and give true conclufions.
Befides the rules that are proper to each figure,
Ariftotle has given fome that are common to all, by
which the legitimacy of fyllogifms may be tried.
Thefe

Partlll. L °
Of Thefe may be reduced to five : 1. There muft be
Reafoning. on]y t]iree terms in a fyllogifm : As each term occurs
' v   in two of the propofitions, it muft be precifely the
fame in both ; if it be not, the iyllogifm is faid to have
four terms, which makes a vicious fyllogifm. 2. T he
middle term muft be taken univerfally in one of the pre-
mifes. 3. Both premifes mult not be particular propo¬
fitions, nor both negative* 4* conclufion muft oe
particular, if either of the premifes be particular ; and
negative, if either ot the premifes be negative. . 5*
term can be taken univerfal/y in the conclufion, if it be
not taken univerfally in the premifes.
For underftanding the fecond and fifth of thefe ruies,
it is neceffary to obferve, that a term is faid to be ta¬
ken univerfally, not only when it is \.\\e fubjecl ot a uni-
verfal propofition, but alto when it is the predicate or
a negative propofition. On the other hand, a term is
faid to be taken particularly, when it is either xhnefub-
jeft of a particular or the predicate of an affirmative pro-
86 pofition.
Toundation HI. The divifion of fyllogifms according to mood
of th.- Other anj figure refpects thofe efpecially which are known
fky the name of plain fimple fyllogilms j that is, which
y oai ms, ^ boun{le(l to three propofitions, all fimple, and
where the extremes and middle term are connected,
according to the rules laid down above. But as the
mind is not tied down to any one precife form of rea-
foning, but fometimes makes ufe of more, lometimes
of fewer premifes, and often takes in compound and
conditional propofitions, it may not be amifs to take
notice of the different forms derived from this fource,
and explain the rules by which the mind condufls it-
« felf in the ufe of them.
Conditional IV. When in any fyllogifm th* major is a condition-
fyllogiiins. al propofition, the fyllogifm itfelf is termed conditional.
Thus:
« If there is a God, he ought to be worftiipped :
“ But there is a God :
“ Therefore he ought to be worftiipped.”
In this example, the major, or firft propofition, is,
we fee, conditional, and therefore the fyllogifm itfelf
is alfo of the kind called by that name. And here tve
are to obferve, that all conditional propofitions are
made of two diftind parts : one exprefling the condi¬
tion upon which the predicate agrees or difagrees with
the fubjedf, as in this now before us, if there is a God i
the other joining or disjoining the faid predicate and
fubjedl, as here, he ought to be wor[hipped. I he firfl:
of thefe parts, or that wdiich implies the condition, is
called the antecedent; the feeond, where we join or dif*
join the predicate and fubjeff, has the name of the con-
fequent.
x ^ V. In all propofitions of this kind, fuppofing them
illation in exa& in point of form, the relation between the
conditional antecedent and confequent muft ever be true and real 5
fyllogifms. that is, the antecedent muft always contain fome cer¬
tain and genuine condition, which neceflarily implies
the confequent •, for otherwife the propofition itfelf
will be falfe, and therefore ought not to be admitted
into our reafonings. Hence it follows, that when any
conditional propofition is affumed, if we admit the
antecedent of that propofition, we muft at the fame
time neceflarily admit the confequent j but if we re¬
ject the confequent, wd are irL like manner bound to
G I C. 151
reject the antecedent. For as the antecedent always Of
exprefles fome condition which neceflarily implies the , ^ninfe‘
truth of the confequent •, by admitting the antecedent,
we allow of that condition, and therefore ought aifo
to admit the confequent. In like manner, if it appears
that the confequent ought to be rejected, the antece¬
dent evidently muft be fo too : becaufe, as wras juft
now demonftrated, the admitting of the antecedent
would neceflarily imply the admiflion alfo of the confe-
quent. . _ • Th

fyllogifms, which lead to a certain and unavoidable con-c0ndltl0nal
clufion. For as the major is always a conditional pro-fyllogifms.
pofition, confifting of an antecedent and a coniequent
if the minor admits the antecedent, it is plain that the
conclufion muft admit the confequent. 1 his is called
arguing from the admiflion of the antecedent to the
admiflion of the confequent, and conftitutes that mood
or fpecies of hypothetical fyllogifms which is diftin-
guiftied in the fchools by the name of the modus ponens,
inafmuch as by it the whole conditional propofition,
both antecedent and confequent, is eftabliihed. Thus :
“ If God is infinitely wife, and a£ts with perfeft
“ freedom, he does nothing but what is beft:
“ But God is infinitely wife, and a<fts with per-
“ fe£l freedom :
“ Therefore he does nothing but what is beft.”
Here we fee the antecedent or firft part of the con¬
ditional propofition is eftabliihed in the minor, and the
confequent or fecond part in the conclufion j whence
the fyllogifm itfelf is an example of the modus ponens.
But if now we on the contrary fuppofe that the mi¬
nor rejedl the confequent, then it is apparent that the
conclufion muft alfo rejedt the antecedent. In this
cafe we are faid to argue from the removal of the con¬
fequent to the removal of the antecedent, and the par¬
ticular mood or fpecies of fyllogifms thence arifing is
called by logicians the modus tollens > becaufe in it both
antecedent and confequent are rejedled or taken away,.,
as appears by the following example :
90
« If God were not a Being of infinite goodnefs,
“ neither would he confult the happinefs of his
“ creatures :
“ But God does confult" the happinefs of his crea-
“ tures :
“ Therefore he is a Being of infinite goodnefs.
VII. Thefe two fpecies take in the whole clafs ofThey in¬
conditional fyllogifms, and include.all the poflible ways^®3^
of arguing that lead to a legitimate conclufion j be" mate ways
caufe we cannot here proceed by a contrary procefs of argUing,
of reafoning, that is, from the removal of the ante¬
cedent to the removal of the confequent, or from the
eftabliihing of the confequent to the eftabliftiing of the
antecedent. For although the antecedent always ex¬
prefles fome real condition, which, once admitted,
neceflarily implies the confequent, yet it does not fol¬
low that there is therefore no other condition ; and if
fo, then, after removing the antecedent, the confe¬
quent may ililL hold, becaufe of fome other determi¬
nation that infers it. When we fay, If a/lone is ex-
pofedfome time to the rays of the fun, it will contraci a
certain degree of heat; the propofition is certainly
true 5 and, admitting the antecedent, we muft alf©
admit .
L O

ner of ar¬
guing in

fyHogifms.
admit tlie confequent. But as there are other ways
by which a ftone may gather heat, it will not follow,
from the ceafmg of the before-mentioned condition,
that therefore the confequent cannot take place. In
other words, we cannot argue: But the Jione has not
been expofed to the rays of the fun ; therefore neither has
it any degree of heat: Inafmuch as there are a great
many other ways by which heat might have been
communicated to it. And if wre cannot argue from
the removal of the antecedent to the removal of the
confequent, no more can we from the admiflion of
the confequent to the admiflion of the antecedent :
becaufe, as the confequent may flow from a great va¬
riety of different fuppofitions, the allowing of it does
not determine the precife fuppofition, but only that
fome one of them muft take place. Thus in the forego¬
ing propofition, If aJione is expofedfome tune to the rays of
thefun, it will contraEl a certain degree of heat; admitting
the confequent, viz. that it has contraBed a certain de¬
gree of heat, we are not therefore bound to admit the
antecedent, that it has been fome time expofed to the rays
of the fun : becaufe there are many other caufes
whence that heat may have proceeded. Thefe two
ways of arguing, therefore, hold not in conditional
fyllogifms.
VIII. As from the major’s being a conditional pro¬
pofition, we obtain the fpecies of conditional fyllo¬
gifms : fo, where it is a disjunctive propofition, the
fyllogifm to which it belongs is alfo called disjun&ive,
as in the following example :
“ The world is either felf-exiftent, or the work of
“ fome finite, or of fome infinite Being :
“ But it is not felf-exiftent, nor the work of a finite
“ being :
“ Therefore it is the work of an infinite Being.”
Now, a disjunctive propofition is that, where of fe-
veral predicates, w>e affirm one neceffarily to belong
to the fubjeCt, to the exclufion of all the reft, but
leave that particular one undetermined. Hence it
follows, that as foon as w'e determine the particular
predicate, all the reft are of courfe to be rejeCted •, or
if we rejeCt all the predicates but one, that one necef¬
farily takes place. When, therefore, in a disjunctive
fyllogifm, the feveral predicates are enumerated in the
major ; if the minor eftabliftres any one of \hefe pre¬
dicates, the conclufion ought to remove all the reft ;
or if, in the minor, all the predicates but one are re¬
moved, the conclufion muft neceflarily eltablifti that
-one. Thus, in the disjunctive fyllogifm given above,
the major affirms one of the three predicates to be¬
long to the earth, viz. felf-exiftence, or that it is the
work of a finite, or that it is the work of an infinite Be¬
ing. Two of thefe predicates are removed in the
minor, viz. fielfexifience, and the work of a finite be¬
ing. Hence the conclufion neceffarily alcribes to it the
.third predicate, and affirms that it is the work of an
infinite Being. If now we give the fyllogifm another
turn, infomuch that the minor may eftablilh one of the
predicates, by affirming the earth to be the production
of an infinite Being : then the conclufion muft remove
the other two, afferting it to be neither felf-exifient,
nor the work of a finite being. Thefe are the forms of
reafoning in thefe fpecies of fyllogifms, the juftnefs of
which appears at firft fight: and that there can be no
G 1 c. Part III.
other, is evident from the very nature of a disjunctive
propofition. v——\r—J
IX. In the feveral kinds of fyllogifms hitherto men- 92
tioned we may obferve that the parts are complete ; ImperfeCl
that is*, the three propofitions of which they confift are
reprefented in form. But it often happens, that fome
one of the premifes is not only an evident truth, but
alfo familiar and in the minds of all men j in w hich
cafe it is ufually omitted, whereby we have an imper-
feCt fyllogifm, that feems to be made up of only tvvo
propofitions. Should we, for inftance, argue in this
manner:
“ Every man is mortal:
“ Therefore every king is mortal :
the fyllogifm appears to be imperfeCl, as confifting but
of two propofitions. Yet it is really complete; only
the minor [every king is a man] is omitted : and left to
the reader to fupply, as being a propofition fo familiar
and evident that it cannot efcape him. ^
X. Thefe feemingly imperfeCl fyllogifms are called Enthyme-
enthymemes; and occur very frequently in reafoning, mes.
efpecially where it makes a part of common conver-
fation. Nay, there is a particular elegance in them,
becaufe, not difplaying the argument in all its parts,
they leave fomewhat to the exercife and invention^ of
the mind. By this means we are put upon exerting
ourfelves, and feem to ffiare in the difcovery of what
is propofed to us. Now this is the great fecret oi
fine writing, fo to frame and put together our thoughts,
as to give full play to the reader’s imagination, and
draw him infenfibly into our very views and courfe
of realoning. ft his gives a pleafure not unlike to that
which the author himfelf feels in compofing. It befides
(hortens difcourfe, and adds a certain force and liveli-
nefs to our arguments, when the words in which they
are conveyed favour the natural quicknefs of the mind
in its operations, and a Angle expreflion is left to exhi¬
bit a whole train of thoughts. # 94
XI. But there is another fpecies of rqafonmg with Ground of
two propofitions, which feems to be complete in itfelf,
and where we admit the conclufion without fuppofing jjate con_
any tacit or fuppreffed judgement in the mind, from fequencey.
which it follows fyllogiftically. _ This happens between
propofitions, where the connexion is fuch, that the ad¬
miflion of the one neceffarily and at the firft fight im¬
plies the admiffion alfo of the other. lor if it fo falls
out, that the propofition on which the other depends is
felf-evident, we content ourfelves wffth barely affirm¬
ing it, and infer that other by a direCl conclufion.
Thus, by admitting an univerfal propofition, we.are
forced alfo to admit of all the particular propofitions
comprehended under it, this being the very condition
that conftitutes a propofition univerfal. If .then that
uuiverfal propofition chances to be felf-evident, the
particular ones follow of courfe, without any. farther
train of reafoning. Whoever allow'S, for inftance,
that things equal to one and the fame thing are equal to
one another, muft at the fame time allow, that two
triangles, each equal to a fquare whofe fide is three inches,
are alfo equal between themfelves. 1 his argument
therefore,
“ Things equal to one and the fame thing, are equal
“ to one another :
“ Therefore,
Part III.
of
Reafoning.
LOG! C.
“ Therefore thefe two triangles, each equal to the
“ fquare of a line of three inches, are equal be-
“ tween themfelves”—
is complete in its kind, and contains all that is necef-
fary towards a juft and legitimate conclufion. For the
fird or univerfal propofition is felf-evident, and there¬
fore requires no farther proof. And as the truth of
the particular is infeparably connected with that of the
univerfal, it follows from it by an obvious and unavoid¬
able confequence.
All reduci- XII. Now, in all cafes of this kind, where propofi-
ble to fyl- tions are deduced one from another, on account of a
logifms of known snd evident connexion, we are faid to reafon
feme one immediate confequence. Such a coherence of pro-
other.0 pofitions manifeft at firft fight, and forcing itfelf upon
the mind, frequently occurs in reafoning. Logicians
have explained at fome length the feveral fuppolitions
upon which it takes place, and allow of all immediate
confequences that follow in conformity to them. It is
however obfervable, that thefe arguments, though
feemingly complete, becaufe the conclufion follows ne-
ceffarily from the fingle propofition that goes before,
may yet be confidered as real enthymemes, whofe ma¬
jor, which is a conditional propofition, is wanting. The
fyllogifm but ^uft mentioned, when reprefented accord¬
ing to this view, wall run as follows :
“ If things equal to one and the fame thing, are
“ equal to one another 5 thefe two triangles, each
“ equal to a fquare whofe fide is three inches, are
“ alfo equal between themfelves.
w But things equal to one and the fame thing, are
“ equal to one another :
H Therefore alfo thefe triangles, &c. are equal be-
“ tween themfelves.”
This obfervation wall be found to hold in all imme¬
diate confequences whatfoever, infomuch, that they are
in fa£l no more than enthymemes of hypothetical fyl-
logifms. But then it is particular to them, that the
ground on which the conclufion refls, namely its co¬
herence with the minor, is of itfelf apparent, and
feen immediately to flow from the rules and reafons of
^gic.
A forites of XIII. The next fpecies of reafoning we fliall take
plain fimple notice of here is wdiat is commonly known by the name
fyllogifins. 0f a Jorites. This is a way of arguing, in which a
great number of propofitions are fo linked together,
that the predicate of one becomes continually the fub-
je£l of the next following, until at laft a conclufion is
formed, by bringing together the fubjeft of the firft
propofition, and the predicate of the laft. Of this
kind is the following argument :
“ God is omnipotent :
“ An omnipotent Being can do every thing pof-
“ fible :
<s He that can do every thing poffible, can do what-
“ ever involves not a contradiction :
“ Therefore God can do whatever involves not a
“ contradiction.”
This particular combination of propofitions may be
continued to any length w-e pleafe without in the leaft
weakening the ground upon which the conclufion refts.
The reafon is, hecaufe the forites itfelf may be refolved
VOL. XII. Part I.
153
into as many fimple fyllogifms as there are middle terms Of _
in it $ wrhere this is found univerfally to hold, that when ^-ea^ning-,
fuch a refolution is made, and the iyliogifms are placed
in train, the conclufion of the laft in the feries is alfo
the conclufion of the forites. This kind of argument,
therefore, as it ferves to unite feveral fyllogifms into
one, muft ftand upon the fame foundation with the fyl¬
logifms of which it confifts, and is indeed, properly
fpeaking, no other than a compendious way of reafon¬
ing fyllogiftically. _ .97
XIV. What is here faid of plain fimple propofitions a forites of
may be as well applied to thofe that are conditional; hypotheti-
that is, any number of them may be fo joined toge-G?!
ther in a feries, that the confequent of one fliall be-^'ims‘
come continually the antecedent of the next following ;
in which cafe, by eftablilhing the antecedent of the firft
propofition, wre eftablifti the confequent of the laft, or
by removing the laft confequent remove alfo the firft an¬
tecedent. This way of reafoning is exemplified in the
following argument:
“ If we love any perfon, all emotions of hatred to-
“ wards him ceafe :
“ If all emotions of hatred towards a perfon ceafe,
“ we cannot rejoice in his misfortunes :
“ If we rejoice not in his misfortunes, we certainly
“ wifti him no injury :
“ Therefore, if wre love a perfon, we wifti him no
“ injury.”
It is evident that this forites, as well as the laft, may
be refolved into a feries of diftindl fyllogifms, with this
only difference, that here the fyllogifms are all condi¬
tional. _
XV. The laft fpecies of fyllogifm we fliall take'phe ground
notice of in this chapter is that commonly diftinguifti- of argu¬
ed by the name of a dilemma. A dilemma is an ar-mentation
gument by which we endeavour to prove the a^hrr-j^^“
dity or falfehood of fome afl'ertion. In order to this,
we affume a conditional propofition, the antecedent
of w hich is the affertion to be difproved, and the con¬
fequent a disjun£five propofition, enumerating all the
poflible fuppofitions upon which that affertion can take
place. If then it appears, that all thefe feveral fup¬
pofitions ought to be rejefted, it is plain, that the an¬
tecedent or affertion itfelf muft be fo too. When
therefore fueh a propofition as that before mentioned
is made the major of any fyllogifm ; if the minor re-
je6fs all the fuppofitions contained in the confequent,
it follows neceffarily, that the conelufion ought to re-
'je& the antecedent, which, as we have faid, is the
very affertion to be difproved. This particular way
of arguing is that which logicians call a dilemma ; and
from the account here given of it, it appears that we
may in the general define it to be a hypothetical fyl¬
logifm, where the confequent of the major is a dis¬
junctive propofition, which is wholly taken away or
removed in the minor. Of this kind is the follow¬
ing :
“ If God did not create the world perfect in its
“ kind, it muft either proceed from want of in-
“ clination, or from want of power :
“ But it could not proceed either from want of in-
“ clination, or from want ef power :
“ Therefore, he created the world perfect in its
U “ kind.”

a abfurd to fay that he did not create the world
“ perfect in its kind,”
XVI. The nature then of a dilemma is univerfally
this. The major is a conditional propoiition, whofe
confequent contains all the feveral fuppofitions upon
which the antecedent can take place. As therefore
thefe fuppofitions are wholly removed in the minor,
it is evident that the antecedent mult be fo too ; info-
much that we here always argue from the removal of
the confequent to the removal of the antecedent. That
is, a dilemma is an argument in the ?nodus tollens of
hypothetical fyllogifins, as logicians love to fpeak.
Hence it is plain, that if the antecedent of the major
is an affirmative propofition, the conclufion of the di¬
lemma will be negative ; but if it is a negative propofi¬
tion, the conclufion will be affirmative.
Chap. V. Of Induction.
I. All reafoning proceeds ultimately from firft
truths, either felf-evident or taken for granted 5 and the
firft truths of fyllogiftic reafonings are general propofi-
tions. But except in the mathematics, and fuch other
fciences as, being converfant about mere ideas, have
no immediate relation to things without the mind, we
cannot afiume as truths propofitions which are geneicd.
The mathematician indeed may be confidered as taking
his ideas from the beginning in their general form.
Every proportion compofed of fuch ideas is therefoie ge¬
neral ; and 'thofe which are theoretic are reducible to
two parts or terms, a predicate and a fubjeci, with a
copula generally affirmative. If the agreement or the
relation between the two terms be not immediate and
felf-evident, he has recourfe to an axiom, which is. a
propofition ftill more general, and which fupplies him
with a third or middle term. This he compares firft
with x\\t predicate, and then with the fuhjecl, or vice
verfa. Thefe two comparifons, when drawn out in
form, make two propofitions, which are called the pre-
mifes ; and if they happen to be immediate anA felf-evi¬
dent, the conclufion, confifting of the terms of the quef-

tion propofed, is faid to be demonftrated. ’Ihis method ^
of reafoning is conduced exaftly in the fyllogiftic form
explained in the preceding chapter.
II. But in fciences which treat of things external
to the mind, we cannot affume as f rjl principles the
moft general propofitions, and from them infer others
lefs and lefs general till we defeend to particulars. The
reafon is obvious. Every thing in the univerfe, whe¬
ther of mind or body, prefents itfelf to our obfervation
in its individual ftate ; fo that perception and judgement
employed in the inveftigation of truth, whether physi¬
cal, metaphysical, moral, or hijlorical, have in the firft;
place to encounter with particulars. “ With thefe
reafon begins, or ffiould begin, its operations.’ It ob-
ferves, tries, canvaffes, examines, and compares them
together, and judges of them by feme of thofe native
evidences and original lights, which, as they are the
firft and indifpenfable inlets of knowdedge to the mind,
have been called the primary principles of truths See
Metaphysics. ioi

This is no hafty, premature, notional abftradtion of the
mind, by which images and ideas are formed that have
no archetypes in nature : it is a rational, operative, ex¬
perimental procefs, inftituted and executed upon the
conPcitution of beings, which in part compofe the uni¬
verfe. By this procefs reason advances from particu¬
lars to generals, from lefs general to more general, till
by a feries of flow progreflion, and by regular degrees,
it arrive at the mo/l general xwdAcm?,, called forms or
formal causes (c). And by affirming or denying a
genus of a ipecies, or an accident of a fubftance or clafs
of fubftances, through all the ftages of the gradation,
we form conclufons, which, if logically drawn, are
axioms (d), or general propofitions ranged one above
another,

(d) The word axiom, literally fignifies dignity : Hence it is ufed metaphorically to denote a general
truth or maxim, and fometimes any truth that is felf-evident, which is called a dignity on account of its import¬
ance in a procefs of reafoning. The axioms of Euclid ar£ propofitions extremely general; and fo are the axioms
of the Newtonian philofophy. But thefe two kinds of axioms have very different origins. The former appear
true upon a bare contemplation of our ideas; whereas the latter are the refult of the moft: laborious indu&ion.
Lord Bacon therefore ftrenuoufly contends that they ffiould never be taken upon conjecture, or even upon the au¬
thority of the learned •, but that, as they are the general principles and grounds of all learning, they thould be
canvaffed and examined with the moft fcrupulous attention, “ ut axiomatum corrigatur jniquitas, quae plerumque
in exemplis vulgaris fundamentum habent:” De dlugm. Sc. lib. ii. cap. 2. “ Atque ilia ipfa putativa principia

a diftinCtion between axioms intuitive and axioms felf-evident. Intuitive axioms, according to him, pafs through
the firft inlets of knowledge, and flaffi direCt conviClion on the minds, as external objects do on the ferdes, of all
men. Other axioms, though not intuitive, may be properly faid to be felf-evident ; becaufe, in their formation,
reafon judges by Angle comparifons without the help of a third idea or middle term fo that they have their evi¬
dence in themfelves, and though induClively framed they cannot be fyllogiftically proved. If this diftinCtion be
juft, and we think it is, only particular truths can be intuitive axioms.

IV. “ Thus, for inftance, f/te evidence of the exter¬
na/ fenfes is obvioufly the PRIMARY PRINCIPLE from
which all phyfical knowledge is derived. But, where¬
as nature begins with caufes, which, after a variety of
changes, produce effedis, the fenfes open upon the cj-
fecis, and from them, through the How and painful
road of experiment and obfervation, afeend to caufes.
By experiments and ohfervations fkilfully chofen, art¬
fully conducted, and judicioufly applied, the philofopher
advances from one ilage of inquiry to another in the ra¬
tional inveftigation of the' general caufes of phyfical
truth. From different experiments and obfervations
made on the fame individual fubjeft, and from the fame
experiments and obfervations made on different fubjefls
of the fame kind, by comparing and judging, he difeo-
vers fome qualities, caufes, or phenomena, which, after
carefully diifinguifhing and rejedting all contradictory
inftances that occur, he finds common to inany. Thus
from many collateral comparifons and judgements form¬
ed upon particulars, he afeends to generals; and by a
repetition of the fame induftrious procefs and laborious
inveftigation, he advances from general to more general,
till at laft he is enabled to form a few of the mof gene¬
ral, with their attributes and operations, into axioms
or fecondary principles, which are the well-founded laws
enadted and enforced by the God of nature.—This is
that juft and philofophic method of reafoning which
found logic preferibes in this as well as in other parts
of learning ; by which, through the flow but certain
road of experiment and obfervation, the mind afeends
from appearances to qualities, from effedls to caufes 5
and from experiments upon many particular fubjedls
forms general propofitions concerning the powers and
properties of phyfical body.
V. “ Axioms fo inveftigated and eftablifhed are ap¬
plicable to all parts of learning, and are the indifpen-
fable, and indeed the wonderful expedients, by which,
to all parts in every branch of knowledge, reafon pufhes on its in-
of learning. qUir;es in the particular purfuit of truth : and the me¬
thod of reafoning by which they are formed, is that of
true and legitimate induction j which is therefore by
Lord Bacon, the beft and foundeft of logicians, called
the hey of interpretation.
VI. “ Inftead of taking his axioms arbitrarily out of
the great families of the categories (fee Category),
and erecting them by his own fophiftical invention in¬
to the principles upon which his deputation was to be
employed, had the analytical genius of Ariftotle. pre-
fented us with the laws of the true INDUCTIVE logic,
by which axioms are philofophically formed, and had
he with his ufual fagacity given us an example of it
in a fingle branch of fcience j he would have brought
to the temple of truth, an offering more valuable than
he has done by the aggregate of all his logic and phi-
lofophical productions.
VII. “ In all fciences, except the mathematics, it is
only after the inductive procefs has been induftriouf-
ly purfued and fuccefsfully performed, that DEFINITION
may be logically and ufefully introduced, by beginning
with the genus, palling through all the graduate and

it defeends, till it arrive at the individual, which is the ^ "aionmg.
fubject of the queftion. And by adding an affirmation
or negation of the attribute of the genus or the fpectes
or individual, or of a general accident on the particular
fuhjlance fo defined, making the definition a propofi-
tion, the truth of the queftion will be logically folved
without any farther procefs. So that inftead of being
the frf, as employed by the logic in common ufe, de¬
finition may be the lafi aft of reafon in the fearch of
truth in general. I0-
VIII. “ Thefe axioms or general propofitions, thus and to fyl-
induBively eftablilhed, become another fpecies of PRiN-*°<dlm'
Cli’LES, which may be properly called secondary,
and which lay the foundation of the fyllogiftic method
of reafoning. When thefe are formed, but not before,
we may fafely admit the maxim with which logicians
fet out in the exercife of their art, as the great hinge
on which their reafoning and deputation turn : Tram
truths that are already known, to derive other which arc
not known. Or, to ftate it more comprehenfively, fo
as to apply to probable as well as to fcientific reafon¬
ing—From truths which are better known, to derive
others which are lefis known. Philofophically fpeaking,
fyllogiftic reafoning is, under general propofitions to re¬
duce others which are lefs general or which are parti¬
cular ; for the inferior ones are known to be true, only
as ive trace their connexion with the fuperior. Logi¬
cally fpeaking, it is, To predicate a genus of a fpecies
or individual comprehended under it, or an accident of
the fuhjlance in which it is inherent. Io(-
IX. “ Thus induction and syllogism are the indudtiem
two methods of dir eel reafoning correfponding to the and fyllo-
two kinds of principles, primary and fecondary, on which §‘4nl totab
they are founded, and by which they are refpeftively^ercnt'
condufted. In both methods, indeed, reafon proceeds
by judging and comparing, but the procefs is different
throughout j and though it may have the fanftion of
Ariftotle, an indudlive fy/Iogifm is a folecifm.
X. “Till general truths are afeertained by indue-induction
tion, the third or middle terms by which fyllogifms are the founda-
made are nowhere fafely to be found. So that ano- b01} °4 fyl*
ther pofition of the Stagyrite, that fyllogifm is naturally
prior in order to induclion, is equally unfounded j for
induBion does not only naturally but neceffarily precede
fiifi/ogifim; and, except in mathematics, is in every re-
Ipeft indifpenfable to its exiftence; fince, till generals
are eftablifhed, there can be neither definition, propofi-
tion, nor axiom, and of courfe no fyllogifm. And as
induftion is the firft, fo is it the more effiential and fun¬
damental inftrument of reafoning : for as fyllogifm can¬
not produce its own principles, it muft have them from
induftion 5 and if the general propofitions or fecondary
principles be imperfeftly or infirmly eftablifhed, and
much more if they be taken at hazard, upon authority,
or by arbitrary affumption like thofe of Ariftotle, all
the fyllogizing in the world is a vain and ufelefs logo¬
machy, only inftrumental to the multiplication of falfe
learning, and to the invention and confirmation of er¬
ror. The truth of fyllogifms depends ultimately on the
truth of axioms, and the truth of axioms on the found-
nefs of induftions (e).”—But though induftion is

Chap, VI. Of Dcmonf ration.
I. Having difpatched what feemed neceffary to be
laid with regard to the two methods of direft reafon-
ing, induBion and fjUcgifm ; we now proceed to confi-
der the laws of demonftration. And here it muft be
acknowledged, that in Aria demonftration, which re¬
moves from the mind all poflibility of doubt or error,
the induflive method of reafoning can have no place.
When the experiments and obfervations from which
the general conclufion is drawn are numerous and ex-
tenftve, the refult of this mode of reafoning is moral
certainty 5 and could the indudlion be made complete,
it would be abfolute certainty, equally convincing with
mathematical demon.ftration. Hut however numerous
and extenfive the obfervations and experiments may
be upon which an indu&ive conclufton is eftabhlhed,
they muft of neceflity come fhort of the number and'
extent of nature j which, in feme cafes, by its im-
menfity, will defeat all poflibility of their co-exten-
fton ; and in others, by its diftance, lies out of the
reach of their immediate application. I hough truth
does not appear in all other departments of learning
with that bold and refiftlefs convidtion with which it
prefides m the mathematical fcience, it ftnnes through
them all, if not interrupted by prejudice or perverted
by error, with a clear and ufeful, though inferior
ftrength. And as it is not necefiary for the general
fafety or convenience of a traveller, that he Ihould al¬
ways enjoy the heat and fplendor of a mid-day fun,
whilft he can with more eafe jaurfue his journey under
the weaker influence of a morning or an evening ray, fo
it is not requilite, for the various concerns and pur-
pofes of life, that men Ihould be led by truth of the
moft redundant brightnefs. Such truth is to be. had
only in thofe fciences which are converfant about ideas
and their various relations ; where every thing being
certainly what it appears to be, definitions and axioms
arife from mere intuition. Here fyllogifm takes up the
procefs from the beginning ; and by a fublime intellec¬
tual motion advances from the fimpleft axioms to the
moft complicated fpeculations, and exhibits truth
fpringing out of its firft and pureft elements, and fpread-
ing on all fides into ft- fyftem of fcience. As each ftep
in the progrefs is fyllogiftic, we (hall endeavour to ex¬
plain the ufe and application of fyllogifms in this fpe-
j0p cies of reafoning.
Of reafon- We have feen, that in all the different appearances
iogby a they put on, we ftill arrive at a juft and legitimate con-
concatena- c|uplon . now it often happens, that the conclufion of
lotfras ~ one iyllog^m becomes a previous propofition in ano-
1 g “ ‘ ther •, by which means great numbers of them are
fometimes linked together in a feries, and truths are
made to follow one another in train. And as in fuch Of
a concatenation of fyllogifms all the various ways of Re:if"ningV
reafoning that are truly conclufive may be with fafety
introduced j hence St is plain, that in deducing any
truth from its firft principles, efpecially where it lies at
a confiderable diftance from them, w'e are at liberty to
combine all the feveral kinds of fyllogifms above ex¬
plained, according as they are found beft to fuit the end
and purpofe of our inquiries. When a propofition is
thus, by means of fyllogifms, colle&ed from others more
evident and knowm, it is faid to be proved; fo that we
may in the general define the proof of a propofition to
be a fyllogifm, or feries of fyllogifms, collefting that
propofition from known and evident truths. But more
particularly, if the fyllogifms of which the proofs confift
admit of no premifes but definitions, felf-evident truths,
and propofitions already eftablilhed, then is the argu¬
ment fo conftituted called a demonf ration ; whereby it
appears that demonftrations are ultimately founded on
definitions and felf-evident propofitions. IIO
II. All fyllogifms whatfoever, whether compound,All fyllo-
multiform, or defedtive, are reducible to plain fituple g1*™5 what-.
fyllogifms in fome one of the four figures. But this is^^J^.
not alt. Syllogifms of the firft figure, in particular, the firft
admit of all poflible conclufions : that is, any propofi- gure.
tions whatfoever, whether an univerfal affirmation or
univerfal negative, a particular affirmative or parti¬
cular negative, which fourfold divifion embraces all
their varieties •, any one of thefe may be inferred by
virtue of fome fyllogifm in the firft figure. By this
means it hapens that the fyllogifms of all the other
figures are reducible alfo to fyllogifms of the firft fi¬
gure, and may be confidered as ftanding on the fame
foundation with them. We cannot here demonftrate
and explain the manner of this reduftion, becaufe it
would too much fwell the bulk of this treatife. It is
enough to take notice that the thing is uniyerfally
known and allowed among logicians, to whofe writ¬
ings we refer fuch as defire farther fatisfatftion in this
matter. This then being laid down, it is plain that
any demonftration whatfoever may be confidered as
compofed of a feries of fyllogifms, all in the firft fi^-
gure. For, fince all the fyllogifms that enter the de¬
monftration are reducible to fyllogifms of fome one of
the four figures; and fmee the fyllogifms of all the
other figures are farther reducible to fyllogifms of the
firft figure, it is evident, that the whole demonftra¬
tion may be refolved into a feries of thefe laft fyllo¬
gifms. Let us now, if poffible, difeover the ground
upon which the conclufion reftsin fyllogifmsof the firft fi¬
gure } becaufe, by fo doing, we ffiall come at an univerfal
principle of certainty, whence the evidence of all demon¬
ftrations in all their parts may be ultimately derived. m
III. The rules then of the firft figure are briefly The grournf'
thefe. The middle term is the fubjesft of the major?1
propofition, and the predicate of the minor. The^^j.®.
major is always an univerfal propofition and the mi¬
nor always affirmative. Let us now fee what effedl
thefe rules will have in reafoning. The major is an
univerfal propofition of which the middle term is the
fubjedft,
ftanding the ruggednefs of its fty1e, has fo much real merit as a fyftem of logic, that it cannot be too diligently
-ftudied by the \ oung inquirer who wilhes to travel by the ftraight road to the temple of Science*
PartHI. L O
fubjed, and the predicate of the conclufion the predi¬
cate. Hence it appears, that in the major the pre¬
dicate of the conclufion is always affirmed or denied
univerfally of the middle term. Again, The minor is
an affirmative propofition, whereof the fubjeft of the
conclufion is the fubjeft, and the middle term the pre¬
dicate. Here then the middle term is affirmed of the
fubjedl of the conclufion*, that is, the fubjedt of the
eonclufion is affirmed to be comprehended under, or
to make a part of, the middle term. I has then we
fee what is done in the premifes of a fyllogifm of the
firft figure. The predicate of the conclufion is uni-
verfaliy affirmed or denied of fome idea, f he fubjedt
of the conclufion is affirmed to be or to make a part
of that idea. Hence it naturally and unavoidably fol¬
lows, that the predicate of the conclufion ought to be
affirmed or denied of the fubjedf. f o illuftrate this by
an example, we (hall refume one of the fyllogiims of
the firft chapter.
lt Kvery creature pofleffed of reafon and liberty is ac
“ countable for his adlions :
« Man is a creature poffeffed of reafon and liberty :
“ Therefore man is accountable for his a dhotis.”
Here, in the firft propofition, the predicate of the
conclufion, accouniablenefs, is affirmed of all creatures
that have reafon and liberty. Again, In the fecond
propofition, man, the fubjedt of the conclufion, is af¬
firmed to be or to make a part of this clais of crea¬
tures. Hence the conclufion neceflarily and unavoid¬
ably follows, viz. that man is accountable for his ac¬
tions-, becaufe, if reafon and liberty be that which
conftitutes a creature accountable, and man has reafon
and liberty, it is plain he has that which conftitutes
him accountable. In like manner, wffiere the major
is a negative propofition, or denies the predicate of
the conclufion univerfally of the middle term, as the
minor always aflerts the fubjedl of the conclufion to
be or make a part of that middle term, it is no lefs
evident that the predicate of the conclufion ought in
this cafe to be denied of the fubjedt. So that the
ground of reafoning, in all fyllogifms of the firft figure,
is manifcftly this: “ Whatever may be affirmed uni¬
verfally of any idea, may be affirmed of every or any
number of particulars comprehended under that idea.”
And again: “ Whatever may be denied univerfally
of any idea, may be in like manner denied of every 01
any number of its individuals. Thefe two propofitions
are called by logicians the diElum de omm, icaA didlum
de tiullo ; and are indeed the great principles of fyl-
logiftic reafoning, inafmuch as all conclufions whatfo-
ever reft immediately upon them, or upon propofitions
deduced from them. But what adds greatly to their
value is, that they are really felf-evident truths, and
fiich as we cannot gainfay without running into an
exprefs contradidlion. To affirm, for inftance, that no
man is perfeB, and yet argue that fome men are perfeB ;
or to fay that all men are mortal, and yet \\\?&fome men
are not mortal, is to alfert a thing to be and not to be at
the fame time.
11 ^ n IV. And now we may affirm, that, in all fyllogifms
tiorTan in- kgure> ^ th6 premifes are true, the conclu-
fallible fion muft needs be true. If it be true that the pre¬
guide to dicate of the conclufion, whether affirmative or nega¬
tive, agree univerfally to fome idea and if it be alfo
G i C. ri7
comprehended under that idea} then it neceffarily ^„a?^-ncr
follows, that the predicate of the conclufion agrees alfo
to the fubjeft. For to aiTert the contrary, would be
to run counter to fome one of the two principles be»
fore eftabliffied that is, it would be to maintain an
evident contradidlion. And thus we are come at laft
to the point we have been all along endeavouring to
eftablilh} namely, that every propofition which can
be demonftrated is neceffarily true. For as every de-
monftration may be refolved into a feries of^ fyllo¬
gifms all in the firft figure and as in any one of thefe
fyllogifms, if the premifes are true, the conclufion
muft needs be fo too} it evidently followTs, that if all
the feveral premifes are true, all the feveral conclu¬
fions are fo, and confequently the conclufion alfo of
the laft fyllogifm, which is always the propofition to
be demonftrated. Now that all the premifes of a de-
monftration are true, will eafily appear from the veiy
nature and definition of that form of reafoning. A
demonftration, as we have faid, is a feries of fyllo¬
gifms, all whofe premifes are either definitions, felf-
evident truths, or propofitions, already eftablilhed.
Definitions are identical propofitions, wherein we con¬
nect the defcription of an idea with the name by
which wTe choofe to have that idea caLed, and theie-
fore as to their truth there can be no difpute. Self-
evident propofitions appear true of themfelves, and
leave no doubt or uncertainty in the mind. Propofi¬
tions, before eftabliftied, are no other than conclufions
gained by one or more fteps from definitions and felf-
evident principles, that is, from true premnes, and
therefore muft needs be true. Whence all the pre¬
vious propofitions of a demonftration being, we fee,
manifeftly1 true j the laft conclufion, or propofition to
be demonftrated, muft be fo too. So that demonftra¬
tion not only leads to certain truth,^ but we have here
alfo a clear view of the ground and foundation of that
certainty. For as, in demonftratmg, we may oe faid
to do nothing more than combine a feries of fyllogifms
together, all refting on the fame bottom } it is plain
that one uniform ground of certainty runs through the
whole, and that the conclufions are everywhere built
upon fome one of the two principles before edabliihed,
as the foundation of all our reafoning. 7 hefe two
principles are eafily reduced into one, and may be ex-
preffed thus: “ Whatever predicate, whether affirma¬
tive or negative, agrees univerfally to any idea 5. the
fame muft needs agree te every or any number of indi¬
viduals comprehended under that idea.” And thus at
length we have, according to our firft defign, reduced
the certainty of demonftration to one fimple and univer-
fal principle -, which carries its own evidence along with
it, and which is indeed the ultimate foundation of all
fyllogiftic reafoning. __ _ 113
v. Demonftration therefore ferving as an infallible The rules
guide to truth, and therefore on fo fure and unalter-of logic fur-
able a bafis, we may now venture to affert, that thenilh a
truth and
certainty.
true that the fubjedl of the conclufion is a part of or
rules of logic furniffi a fufficient criterion for the -loffcr the
ftinguifhing between truth and falfehood. For fince diftmgmfh.
every propofition that can be demonftrated is necef-ingbetween
farily true, he is able to diftinguiffi truth from falfe- truth and
hood who can with certainty judge when a propoli- falfehood;
tion is truly demonftrated. Now, a demonftration is,
as we have faid, nothing more than a concatenation
of fyllogifms, all whofe premifes are definitions, feif-

evident truths, or proportions previoufly eftabliflied.
• To judge therefore of the validity of a demonftration,
we mull be able to diftinguilh whether the definitions
that enter it are genuine, and truly defcriptive of the
ideas they are meant to exhibit : whether the pro-
potitions atTumed without proofs as intuitive truths
have really that felf-evidence to which they lay claim :
whether the fyllogifms are drawm up in due form,
and agreeable to the laws of argumentation : in fine,
whether they are combined together in a juft and or¬
derly manner, fo that no demonftrable propofitions
ferve anywhere as premifes unlefs they are conclu-
fions of previous fyllogifms. Now7, it is the bufinefs
of logic, in explaining the feveral operations of the
mind, fully to inftruft us in all thefe points. It teaches
the nature and end of definitions, and lays down the
rules by which they ought to be framed. It unfolds
the feveral fpecies of propofitions, and diftinguilhes
the felf-evident from the demonftrable. It delineates
alfo the different forms of fyllogifms, and explains the
laws of argumentation proper to each. In fine, it de-
fcribes the manner of combining fyllogifms, fo as that
they may form a train of reafoning, and lead to the
fucceflive difcovery of truth. The precepts of logic,
therefore, as they enable us to judge with certainty
when a propofition is duly demonftrated, furnifti a
fure criterion for the diftinguiftiing between truth and
falfehood.
VI. Perhaps it may be objected, that demonftra¬
tion is a thing very rare and uncommon, as being the
prerogative of but a few fciences, and therefore the
criterion here given can be of no great ufe. But
wherever, by the bare contemplation of our ideas,
truth is difcoverable, there alfo demonftration may be
attained. Now that is an abundantly fufficient crite¬
rion which enables us to judge with certainty in all
cafes where the knowledge of truth comes within cur
reach for with difcoveries, that lie beyond the li¬
mits of the human mind, we have, properly, no bufi¬
nefs or concernment. When a propofiticn is demon¬
ftrated, we are certain of its truth. When, on the
contrary, our ideas are fuch as have no vifible connec¬
tion or repugnance, and therefore furnifti not the pro¬
per means of tracing their agreement or difagreement,
there we are fure that fcientifical knowledge is not
attainable. But where there is feme foundation of
reafoning, which yet amounts not to the full evidence
of demonftration, there the precepts of logic, by
teaching us to determine aright of the degree of
proof, and of what is ftill wanting to render it full
and complete, enable us to make a due eftimate of
the meafures of probability, and to proportion our
affent to the grounds on which the propolition ftands.
And this is all we can poflibly arrive at, or even fo
much as hope for, in the exercife of faculties fo im¬
pel -eel and limited as ours.
VII. Before we conclude this chapter, it may not
be improper to take notice of the difiinflion of demon¬
ftration into direB and indircB. A direB detnonflration
is, when, beginning with definitions, felf evident pro-
pofitions, or known and allowed truths, w^e form a
train of fyllogifms, and combine them in an orderly
manner, continuing the feries through a variety of fuc-
cefiive fteps, until at laft we arrive at a fyllpgifm whofe
conclulion is the propofition to be demonftrated. Proofs

of this kind leave no doubt or uncertainty behind Of
them ; becaufe, all the feveral premifes being true, the Reaforing..
cdnclufions rnuft be io too, and of courfe the very laft ^ 1111
conclufion or propofition to be proved. The other
fpecies of demonftration is the indireB, or, as it is
fometimes called, the apogogical. The manner of pro¬
ceeding here is, by affuming a propofition which di-
redlly contradicls that we mean to demonftrate $ and
thence, by a continued train of reafoning, in the way
of a diredl demonftration, deducing fome abfurdity or
manifeft untruth. For hereupon we conclude, that
the propofition affirmed was falfe 5 and thence again,
by an immediate confequence, that the propofition to
be demonftrated is true. Thus Euclid, in his third
book, being to demonftrate that circles which touch one
another inwardly have not the fame centre, affumes the
direct contrary to this, viz. that they have the fame cen¬
tre $ and thence, by an evident train of reafoning,
proves that a part is equal to the whole. The fuppofi-
tion therefore leading to this abfurdity he concludes to
be falfe, viz. that circles touching one another inwardly
have the fame centre ; and thence again immediately in¬
fers, that they have not the fame centre. 1J(-)
VIII. Now, becaufe this manner of demonftration is Ground of
accounted by fome not altogether fo clear and fatisfac-Fea/orjng
tory ; we (hall therefore endeavour to (how, that
equally with the other leads to truth and certainty, a"
Two propofitions are faid to be contradidlory one of
another, w7hen that which is afferted to be in the one
is afferted not to be in the other. Thus the propofi¬
tions, Circles that touch one another inwardly have the
fame centre, and Circles that touch one another inwardly
have not the fame centre, are contradlBories, becaufe the
fecond afferts the diredt contrary of what is afferted
in the firft. Now, in all contradidlory propofitions,
this holds univerfally, That one of them is neceffarily
true, and the other neceffarily falfe. For if it be
true, that circles which touch one another inwardly
ha^e not the fame centre j it is unavoidably falfe that
they have the fame centre. On the other hand, if it
be falfe that they have the fame centre, it is neceffarily
true that they have not the fame centre. Since therefore
it is impoffible for them to be both true or both falfe
at the fame time $ it unavoidably follows, that one is
neceffarily true, and the other neceflarily falfe. This
then being allowed, which is indeed felf-evident j if any
two contradictory propofitions are affirmed, and one of
them can by a clear train of reafoning be demonftrat¬
ed to be falfe, it neceflarily follows that the other is true.
For as the one is neceflarily true, and the other necef-
farily falfe ; when we come to difeover which is the falfe
propofition, we thereby alfo know the other to be true.
IX. Now this is precifely the manner of an indiredtIndire<£l Je-
demonftration, as is evident from the account given ofmonftra-
it above. For there we affume a propofition which di-tl0Ps a ^lire
redtly contradidls that we mean to demonftrate j and, e-^
having by a continued feries of proofs fhown it to be
falfe, thence infer that it is contradidlory, or the pro¬
pofition to be demonfirated, is true. As, therefore,
this laft conclufion is certain and unavoidable 5 let us
next inquire after what manner we come to be fatisfied
of the fallehood of the affumed propofition, that fo no
poflible doubt may remain as to the force and validity
of demonftrations of this kind. The manner then is
plainly this : Beginning with the affumed propofition.
Fart IV. . L °
Of Method, we, bv the help of definitions, felf-evxdent truths, or
u—v   propofitions already eftablilhed, continue a fenes of
reafoning, in the way of a direft demonftration, until
at length we arrive at feme abfurdity or known falie-
hocd,& Thus Euclid, in the example before mention¬
ed, from the fuppofition that circles touching one an¬
other inwardly have the fame centre, deduces that a
part is equal to the whole. Since, tneieioie, bj a due
and orderly procefs of reafoning, ue come at laid to a
falfe conclufion •, it is manifeft, that all the premifes
cannot be true : for, were all the premifes true, the
laft conclufion muft be fo too, by what has been be¬
fore demonifrated. Now, as to all the other premifes
made ufe of in the courfe of reafoning, they are mani¬
feft and known truths by fuppofition, as being either
definitions, felf-evident propofitions, or truths previ-
oufly eftabliftied. The affumed propofition is that on-
ly as to which any doubt or uncertainty remains.
That alone, therefore, can be falfe ; and indeed, from
what has been already ftiown, muft unavoidably be fo.
And thus we fee, that in ifidirect demonftrations, two
contradidlory propofitions being laid down, one of
which is demonftrated to be falfe, the other, which, is
always the proportion to be proved, rauft neceffarily
be true fo that here, as well as in the dirett way of
proof, w7e arrive at a clear and iatisfadf ory know ledge
of truth. . .
X. This is univerfally the method of reafoning m all
'kSe'of apogogical or direft demonftrations. But if any pro-
indirect de-pofition is aflumed, from which, in a diredf tram of
monltra- reafoning, we can deduce its contradictory 5 the pro¬
pofition fo affumed is falfe, and the contradiaory one
true. For if we fuppofe the affumed propofition to
be true, then, fince all the other premifes that enter
the demonftration are alfo true, wTe ftiall have a feries
of reafoning confifting wholly of true premifes; whence
the laft conclufion or contradiaory of the affumed pro¬
pofition muft be true likewife : fo that by this means
we ftiould have two contradiaory propofitions both
true at the fame time, which is manifeftly impoflible.
The aflumed propofition, therefore, whence this abfur¬
dity flows, muft neceflarily be falfe ; and confequently
its contradiaory, which is here the propofition deduced
from it, muft be true. If then any propofition is pro-
pofed to be demonftrated, and we qffume the contra-
ciElory of that propofition, and thence direaiy infer
the propofition to be demonftrated j by this very means
we know that the propofition fo inferred is true. For,
fince from an aflumed propofition wTe have deduced its
contradiaory, we are thereby certain that the aflumed
propofition is falfe j and if fo,. then its .contradiaory,
or that deduced from it, which in this cafe . is the
fame with the propofition to be demonftrated, muft be
true.

XI. We have a curious inflance of this in the twelfth Of Method-
propofition of the ninth book of the Elements. Eu- ^
did there propofes to demonftrate, that in any feries ^ due
of numbers, rifing from unity in geometrical progref- knowledge
fon, all the prime numbers that meafire the laft term °f the Pfi"-
in the feries will alfo meafurc the next after unity. In °“
order to this, he affumes the contradiaory or the pf°-penfal>ly
pofition to be demonftrated*, namely, thatfome prime necefikvy to
number tneafurmg the lafl term in the feries does not make us
mcafure the next after unity ; and thence, by a conti- of
nued train of reafoning, proves that it aaually does^n^ftra.
meafure it. Hereupon he concludes the aftumed pro-tion;
pofition to be falfe * and that which is deduced from
it, or its contradiaory, which is the very propofition
he propofed to demonftrate, to be true. Now* that
this is a juft and conclufive way of reafoning, is a-
bundantly manifeft from what we have fo clearly efta¬
bliftied above. Whence it appears, how neceflary feme
knowledge of the rules of logic is, to enable us to judge
of the force, juftnefs, and validity, of demonftrations.
For, though it is readily allowed, that by the mere
ftrength of our natural faculties w*e can at once difeern,
that of two contradi&ory -propofitions, the one is ne¬
ceffarily true, and the other neceffarily falfe ; yet
when they are fo linked together in a demonftration,
as that the one ferves as a previous propofition wdience
the other is deduced, it does not fo immediately ap¬
pear, without fome knowledge of the principles of lo¬
gic, why that alone, which is colle&ed by reafoning,
ought to be embraced as true, and the other, whence
it is collefted, to be rejected as falfe. 120
XII. Having thus fufticiently evinced the certainty of and ofit-
demonftration in all its branches, and ftiown the rules by klffuffi-
which w*e ought to proceed, in order to arrive at a juft a_
conclufion, according to the various w*ays of arguing gajnfl. crroi..
made ufe of j it is needlefs to enter upon a particular and falfe
confideration of thofe feveral fpecies of falfe reafoning reafoning..
which logicians diftinguifti by the name of fophifms.
He that thoroughly underftands the form and ttruc-
ture of a good argument, will of himfelf readily dif¬
eern every deviation from it. And although fophifms
have been divided into many claffes, which are all
called by founding names, that therefore carry in them
much appearance of learning 5 yet are the errors
themfelves fo very palpable and obvious, that it would*
be loft labour to write for a man capable of being
milled by them. Here, therefore, w7e choofe to conclude
this part of logic : and ftiall in the next give fome
account of Method, which, though infeparable from
reafoning, is neverthelefs always confidered by logi¬
cians as a diftinct operation of the mind *, becaufe its
influence is not confined to the mere exercife of the
reafbning faculty, but extends in fome degree to alL
the tranfaclions of the underftanding.

hand well acquainted with the truths we are to combine
together ; otherwife, how could we difcern their feveral
connexions and relations, or fo difpofe of them as
their mutual dependence may require ? But it often
happens, that the underftanding is employed, not in
the arrangement and compofition of known truths,
but in the fearch and difcovery of fuch as are un¬
known. And here the manner of proceeding is very
different. We affemble at once our whole flock of
knowledge relating to any fubje£l, and, after a ge¬
neral furvey of things, begin with examining them fe-
parately and by parts. Hence it comes t© pafs, that
whereas, at our firft fettfng out, we were acquainted
only with fome of the grand flrokes and outlines of
truth j by thus purfuing her through her feveral
windings and receffes, we gradually difcover thofe
more inward and finer touches whence fhe derives all
her flrength, fymmetry, and beauty. And here it
is, that when, by a narrow' fcrutiny into things, W'e
have unravelled any part of knowledge, and traced it
to its firfl and original principles, infomuch that the
whole frame and contexture of it lies open to the view
of the mind j here it is, that, taking it the contrary
way, and beginning with thefe principles, wre can fo
adjufl and put together the parts as the order and me¬
thod of fcience requires.
III. But as thefe things are befl underflood when il-
by the fimi- luflrated by examples, let us fuppofe any machine, for
watch°^a *n^ance a watch* prefented to us, whofe flru£lure and
compofition we are as yet unacquainted with, but
want, if poffible, to difcover. The manner of pro¬
ceeding, in this cafe, is, by taking the whole to pieces,
and examining the parts feparately, one after another.
When, by fuch a fcrutiny, we have thoroughly in¬
formed ourfelves of the frame and contexture of each,
we then compare them together, in order to judge of
their mutual adlion and influence. By this means we
gradually trace out the inw'ard make and compofition
of the whole, and come at length to difcern how parts
of fuch a form, and fo put together as we found in
unravelling and taking them afunder, conflitute that
particular machine called a watch, and contribute to
yll the feveral motions and phenomena obfervable in
it. This difcovery being made, we can take things
the contrary way, and, beginning w’ith the parts, fo
difpofe and connefl them as their feveral ufes and flruc-
tures require, until at length we arrive at the whole
itfelf, from the unravelling of which thofe parts re-
fulted.
Ground of IV. And as it is in tracing and examining the wmrks
the analytic of art j fois it, in a great meafure, in unfolding any part
and fynthe- Gf human know/ledge : for the relations and mutual
tic methods, habitudes of things.do not always immediately appear
upon comparing them one wdth another. Hence w'e
have recourfe to intermediate ideas 5 and, by means of
them, are furnifhed with thofe previous propofitions
that lead to the conclufion we are in queft of. And
if it fo happens that the previous propolitions them-
felves are not fufficiently evident, we endeavour, by new
middle terms, to afcertain their truth ; Hill tracing
things backward, in a continual feries, until at length
we arrive at fome fyllogifm where the premifes are firft
and felf-evident principles. This done, we become
perfedlly fatisfied as to-the truth of all the conclufions

inafmuch as they are now Of Method,
feen to Hand upon the firm and immoveable founda-v—■"v——
tion of our intuitive perceptions. And as we arrived
at. this certainty by tracing things backward to the
original principles whence they flow ; fo may we at
any time renew it by a dire£l contrary procefs, if, be¬
ginning with thefe principles, we carry the train of
our thoughts forward until they lead us, by a con-
nedled chain of proofs, to the very laft conclufion of
the feries.
V. Hence it appears, that, in difpofing and putting Divifiou of
together our thoughts, either for our own ufe, that the method in-
difcoveries we have made may at all times lie open toto ana!ytic
the review' of the mind, or where we mean to commu-ancl fynthe“
nicate and unfold the difcoveries to others, there aretlC‘
two w'ays of proceeding equally within our choice :
for w'e may fo propofe the truths relating to any part
of knowledge, as they prefented themfelves to the mind
in the manner of inveftigation ; carrying on the feries
of proofs, in a reverfe order, until they at laft termi¬
nate in firft principles : or, beginning with thefe prin¬
ciples, w'e may take the contrary way, and from them
deduce, by a diredl train of reafoning, all the feveral
propofitions we want to eftablifti. This diverfity in the
manner of arranging our thoughts gives rife to the
twofold divifion of method eftabliftied among logi¬
cians : for method, according to their ufe of the word,
is nothing elfe but the order and difpofition of our
thoughts relating to any fubjedl. When truths are fo
propofed and put together as they were or might have
been difcovered, this is called \ht analytic method, or the
method of refolution ; inafmuch as it traces things back¬
ward to their fource, and refolves knowdedge into its
firft and original principles. When, on the other hand,
they are deduced from thefe principles, and connefted
according to their mutual dependence, infomuch that
the truths firft in order tend always to the demonftra-
tion of thofe that follow ; this conftitutes what we call
the fynthetic method or method of compoftion. For here
W’e proceed by gathering together the feveral fcatter-
ed parts of knowledge, and combining them into one
whole or fyftem, in fuch manner that the underftand¬
ing is enabled diftinftly to follow truth through all her
different ftages and gradations.
VI. There is this farther to be taken notice of, in Called o-
relation to thefe two fpecies of method ; that the firft therw'ife
has alfo obtained the name of the method of invention,1^. raet,10(l
becaufe it obferves the order in which our thoughts
fucceed one another in the invention or difcovery of the method
truth. The other, again, is often denominated the of fcience-,
method of doBrine or infruBion ; inafmuch as, in laying
our thoughts before others, we generally choofe to
proceed in the fynthetic manner, deducing them from
their firft principles. For we are to obferve, that al¬
though there is great pleafure in purfuing truth in the
method of inveftigation, becaufe it places us in the
condition of the inventor, and fhow's the particular
train and procefs of thinking by which he arrived at
his difcoveries ; yet it is not fo well accommodated to
the purpofes of evidence and convidlion. For, at our
firft fetting out, we are commonly unable to divine
where the analyfis will lead us; infomuch that our re-
fearches are for fome time little better than a mere
groping in the dark. And even after light begins to
break in upon us, wre are ftill obliged to many reviews,

Of Method, and a frequent companion of the feveral f)ep3 of the
k •— v—'*'1 ■' inveftigation among themfelves. Nay, when wre have
unravelled the whole, and reached the very foundation
on which our difcoveries ftand, all our certainty, in re-
1 gard to their truth, will be found in a great meafure to
arife from that connexion we are now able to difcern
between them and firit principles, taken in the order of
compofition. But in the fynthetic manner of difpof-
ing our thoughts, the cafe is quite different : for as
we here begin with the intuitive truths, and advance
by regular deduftions from them, every ftep of the
procedure brings evidence and conviftion along with
it ; fo that, in our progrefs from one part of know¬
ledge to another, we have always a clear perception of
the ground on which our affent refts. In communi¬
cating therefore our difcoveries to others, this method
is apparently to be chofen, as it wonderfully improves
and enlightens the underftanding, and leads to an im¬
mediate perception of truth.
VII. The logic which for fo many ages kept pof-
fedion of the fchools, and was deemed the moft im¬
portant of the fciences, has long been condemned as a
mere art of wrangling, of very little ufe in the purfuit
of truth. Attempts have been made to reftore it to
credit, but without fuccefs ; and of late years little or
no attention whatever has been paid to t/ie art of rea-
' foxing in the courfe of what is called a liberal education.
As both extremes may be faulty, it fhould feem that
we cannot conclude this Ihort treatife more properly
than with the following
Reflections on the Utility of Logic.
If Ariflotle was not the inventor of logic, he was
certainly the prince of logicians. The wrhole theory
of fyllogifms he claims as his own, and as the fruit of
much time and labour ; and it is univerfally known,
that the later writers on the art have borrowed their
materials almoft entirely from his Organon and Por¬
phyry’s Introdu&ion. But after men had laboured
near 2000 years in fearch of truth by the help of fyl¬
logifms, Lord Bacon propofed the method of induc¬
tion, as a more effedlual engine for that purpofe ; and
fmee his days the art of logic has gradually fallen in¬
to difrepute.
To this confequence many caufes contributed. The
art of fyllogifm is admirably calculated for wrangling ;
and by the fchoolmen it was employed with too much
fuccefs, to keep in countenance the abfurdities of the
Rotnifh church. Under their management it pro¬
duced numberlefs difputes, and numberlefs fe£ls, who
fought againft each other with much animofity with¬
out gaining or lofing ground } but it did nothing con-
liderable for the benefit of human life, wliilft the me¬
thod of induflion has improved arts and increafed
knowledge. It is no wonder, therefore, that the ex-
ceflive admiration of Ariftotle, which continued for fo
many ages, Ihould end in an undue contempt : and
that the high efteem of logic, as the grand engine of
fcience, fhould at laft make way for too unfavourable
an opinion, which feems now prevalent, of its being
unworthy of a place in a liberal education. Men rare¬
ly leave one extreme without running into the contrary :
Thofe who think according to the fafhion, will be as
prone to go into the prefent extreme as their grand¬
fathers were to go into the former j and even they who

in general think for themfelves, when they are offend- Of Method,
ed at the abufe of any thing, are too apt to entertain '
prejudices againft the thing itfef “ In praflice (fays
the learned War burton *), logic is more a trick than * lufrodue-
a faience^ formed rather to amufe than to inftrucl. tl?n tc J11’
And in fome fort we may apply to the art of fyllogifm^c*
what a man of wit fays of rhetoric, that it only
tells us how to name thofe tools which nature had be¬
fore put into our hands. In the fervice of chicane, in¬
deed, it is a mere juggler’s knot, now faft, now loofe j
and the fchools where this legerdemain was exercifed
in great perfedlion are full of the ftories of its wonders.”
The authority of Warburton is great j but it may be
counterbalanced by another, which, on fubjefts of this
nature, is cenfeffedly greater.
“ Laying afide prejudice, whether faftiionable or
unfalhionable, let us confider (fays Dr Reid f) whe- f Appendix
ther logic is or may be made fubfervient to any goodt0
purpofe. Its profeffed end is, to teach men to think, ^
to judge, and to reafon, with precifion and accuracy, the Princi-
No man will fay this is a matter of little importance :pies and
the only thing therefore that can admit of doubt is, Pr0Srefs °f
whether it can be taught ? Reafon.
“ To refolve this doubt, it may be obferved, that
our rational faculty is the gift of God, given to
men in very different meafures: Some have a large
portion, fome a lefs ; and where there is a remarkable
defect of the natural power, it cannot be fupplied by
any culture. But this natural power, even where it
is the ftrongeft, may lie dead for want of the means of
improvement. Many a favage may have been born
with as good faculties as a Newton, a Bacon, or an
Ariflotle ; but their talents were buried by having never
been put to ufe, whilft thofe of the philofophers were
cultivated to the beft advantage. It may likewife be
obferved, that the chief mean of improving our ration¬
al power, is the vigorous exercife of it in various ways
and on different fubje£ls, by which the habit is ac¬
quired of exercifmg it properly. Without fuch ex¬
ercife, and good feT»fe over and above, a man who has
ftudied logic all his life may be only a petulant wrang¬
ler, without true judgement or Ikill of reafoning in any
fcience.”
This muft have been Locke’s meaning, when in his
Thoughts on Education, he fays, “ If you would have
your fon to reafon well, let him read Chillingworth.”
The ftate of things is much altered fince Locke wrote :
Logic has been much improved chiefly by his writings j
and yet much lefs ftrefs is laid upon it, and lefs time
confumed in its ftudy. His counfel, therefore, was ju¬
dicious and feafonable ; to wit, That the improvement
of our reafoning power is to be expedled much more
from an intimate acquaintance with the authors who
reafon beft, than from ftudying voluminous fyftems ol
fchool logic. But if he had meant, that the ftudy ol
logic was of no ufe, nor deferved any attention, he
furely wnuld not have taken the pains to make fo con-
liderable an addition to it, by his Effay on the Human
Underfunding, and by his Thoughts on the ConduB of the
Undetf ending; nor would he have remitted his pupil
to Chillingworth, the acuteft logician as well as the belt
reafoner of his age.”
There is no ftudy better fitted to exercife and
{Lengthen the reafoning powers than that of the ma¬
thematical fciences j becaufe there is no other branch
X d.
162 LOGIC. Part IV.
Of Method, of fclence which gives fiich fcope to long and accu-
"" v ' rate trains of reafoning, or in which there is fo little
room for authority or prejudice of any kind to give a
falfe bias to the judgement. When a youth of mode¬
rate parts begins to ftudy Euclid, every thing is new
to him : His apprehenfion is unlteady: his judgement
is feeble 5 and rerts partly upon the evidence of the
thing, and partly upon the authority of his teacher.
But every time he goes over the definitions, the axioms,
the elementary propofitions, more light breaks in upon
him ; and as he advances, the road of demonftration
becomes fmooth and eafy; he can walk in it firmly,
and take wider fteps, till at laft he acquires the habit
not only of underftanding a demonflration, but of dif-
covering and demonftrating mathematical truths.
It muft indeed be confefled, that a man without the
rules of logic may acquire a habit of reafoning juftly
in mathematics, and perhaps in any other fcience. Good
fenfe, good examples, and aflfiduous exercife, may bring
a man to reafon juftly and acutely in his own profeflion
without rules. But whoever thinks, that from this
conceftion he may infer the inutility of logic, betrays
by this inference a great want of that art j for he
might as well infer, becaufe a man may go from Edin¬
burgh to London by the way of Paris, that therefore
any other road is ufelefs.
There is perhaps no art which may not be acquired,
in a very confiderable degree, by example and prac¬
tice, without reducing it to rules. But pradtice join¬
ed with rules may carry a man forward in his art far¬
ther and more quickly than praftice without rules.—
Every ingenious artift knows the utility of having his
art reduced to rules, and thereby made a fcience. By
rules he is enlightened in his pradlice, and works with
more affurance. They enable him fometimes to corredl
his own errors, and often to detedl the errors of others j
and he finds them of great ufe to confirm his judgement,
to juftify what is right, and to condemn what is wrong.
Now mathematics are the nobleft praxis of logic.
Through them we may perceive how the ftated forms
of fyllogifm are exemplified in one fubjedl, namely the
predicament of quantity $ and by marking the force of
thefe forms, as they are there applied, we may be en¬
abled to apply them of ourfelves elfewhere. Whoever,
therefore, will ftudy mathematics with this view, will
become not only by mathematics a more expert logici¬
an, and by logic a more rational mathematician, but a
wifer philofopher, and an acuter reafoner, in all the pof-
fible fubjedls either of fcience or deliberation. But
when mathematics, inftead of being applied to this ex¬
cellent purpofe, are ufed not to exemplify logic, but
to fupply its place j no wonder if logic fall into con¬
tempt, and if mathematics, inftead of furthering fci¬
ence, become in fa# an obftacle. For when men,
knowing nothing of that reafoning which is univerfal,
come to attach themfelves for years to a Jingle fpecies,
a fpecies wholly involved in lines and numbers, the mind
becomes incapacitated for reafoning at large, and efpe-
cially in the fearch of moral truth. The objeft of ma¬
thematics is demonflralion; and whatever in that fci¬
ence is not demonftration, is nothing, or at leaft below
the fublime inquirer’s regard. Probability, through
its almoft infinite degrees, from fimple ignorance up to
abfdlute certainty, is the terra incognita of the mathe-
xnatician. ^nd yet here it is that the great bujinefs
of the human mind is carried on in the fearch and dif- Of Method*
covery of all the important truths which concern us ^
as reafonable beings. And here too it is that all its
vigour is exerted : for to proportion the aflent to the
probability accompanying every varying degree of mo¬
ral evidence, requires the moft enlarged and fovereign
exercife of reafon.
In reafonings of this kind, will any man pretend
that it is of no ufe to be wTell acquainted with the va¬
rious powers of the mind by which we reafon ? Is it
of no ufe to refolve the various kinds of reafoning in¬
to their fimple elements j and to difeover, as far as we
are able, the rules by which thefe elements are com¬
bined in judging and in reafoning ? Is it of no ufe to
mark the various fallacies in reafoning, by which even
the moft ingenious men have been led into error ? It
mnft furely betray great want of underftanding, to
think thefe things ufelefs or unimportant. Now thefe
are the things which logicians have attempted j and
which they have executed—not indeed fo completely
as to leave no room for improvement, but in fuch a
manner as to give very confiderable aid to our reafon¬
ing powers. That the principles they have laid down
with regard to definition and divifion, with regard to
the converfion and oppofition of propofitions, and the
general rules of reafoning, are not without ufe, is fuf-
ficiently apparent from the blunders committed daily
by thofe who difdain any acquaintance with them.
Although the art of categorical fyllogifm is confef-
fedly little fitted for the difeovery of unknown truth,
it may yet be employed to excellent purpofes, as it is
perhaps the moft compendious method of detefting a
fallacy. A man in queft of unknown truths muft ge¬
nerally proceed by the way of induftion, from effects to
caufes j but he, who as a teacher is to inculcate any
lyftem upon others, begins with one or more felf-evi¬
dent truths, and proceeds in the way of demonftration,
to the conclufion which he wifties to eftablifti. Now
every demonftration, as has been already obferved, may
be refolved into a feries of fyllogifms, of which the
conclufion of the preceding always enters into the pre-
mifes of that which follows : and if the firft principles
be clear and evident, and every fyllogifm in fome legi¬
timate mode and figure, the conclufion of the whole
muft infallibly be admitted. But when the demon¬
ftration is thus broken into parts j if we find that the
conclufion of one fyllpgifm will not, without altering
the meaning of the terms, enter legitimately into the
premifes of that which fhould immediately follow; or,
fuppofing it to make one of the premifes of a new fyl¬
logifm, if we find that the conclufion, refulting from
the whole feries thus obtained, is different from that
of the demonftration $ we may, in either of thefe cafes,
reft affured that the author’s reafoning is fallacious,
and leads to error j and that if it carried an appear¬
ance of convidtion before it was thus refolved into its
elementary parts, it muft have been owing to the ina¬
bility of the mind to comprehend at once a long train
of arguments. Whoever wifties to fee the fyllogiftic
art employed for this purpofe, and to be convinced of
the truth of what we have faid refpedting its utility,
may confult the excellent writer recommended by
Locke, who, in places innumerable of his incompar¬
able book, has, without pedantry, even in that pe¬
dantic age, made the happieft application of the rules

LOGOGRAPHY, a new method of printing, in
which the types, inftead of anfwering only to fmgle let¬
ters, are made to correfpond to whole words.
This method, though feemingly a retrograde procef-
fion in the printing art, has lately obtained the fanc-
tion of his majefty’s patent, and has for fome time been
aflually put in execution in the way of trade, apparent¬
ly with advantage to the proprietors. In the year 1783*
a treatife upon this fubjeft appeared by Henry Johnfon,
in which the origin as well as the utility of the art are
fully laid down, and the matter fet forth in fuch a light
as can fcarce allow us to doubt that it is an improve¬
ment in the art. Mr johnfon informs us, that about
five years before, viz. in the year I77^> intending to
publilh a daily lift of blanks and prizes in the lottery
numerically arranged, he found it could not be accom-
pliffied in time by the ordinary way of printing. On
this account he procured types of two, three, or more
figures as was neceffary for his purpofe j and thus any
entire number might as readily be taken up as if it had
been a Angle type. His next attempt was in forming
fome large mercantile tables of pounds, {hillings, pence,
and farthings. For thefe he procured types expreffive of
any fum of money ready compofed and united, “ by
which (fays he) every fpecies of figure-printing could
be performed for the tenth part of the coft, printers
always charging it double the price of letter-print¬
ing.” Having thus fucceeded to his wifti in his two
firft attempts, he next began to confider if the me¬
thod could not be applied to words j and in this alfo
the fuccefs was equal.
The properties of the logographic art, according to
our author, are, 1. That the compofitor ftiall have lefs
charged upon his memory than in the common way.
2. It is much lefs liable to error. 3. The type of each
word is as eafily laid hold of as that of a Angle letter.
4. The decompoAtion is much more readily performed,
even by the mereft novices, than they now decompofe
letters. 5. No extraordinary expence nor greater num¬
ber of types is required in the logographic than in the
common method of printing.
The Arft of thefe poAtions is proved by our author
in the following manner. In the common method,
the compoAtor has 150 diviAons to which there is no
reference, and the printing offices are not agreed with
refped to the mode of placing their boxes ; “ but
under this improvement he has only to know the
.letters of the alphabet, and is affifted with an index
LOG
of them, infomuch that tha Amplicity of the latter hogogra*.
apparatus enables him, by a little praftice, to lay his , p^y‘ .
finger almoft blindfold on the word required j and the
meaneft capacity is equal to this mental exercife,
having little more to do than knowing by infpeftion
the difference between words under three and thofe
above three fyllables j and ail the apparatus being
within a compafs not a great deal more extended than
common printing, for thefe reafons he is as foon pof-
fefled of his type of a -word as they are of a Angle
letter.”
Thus the firft and third pofitions may be faid to
be proved ; but in his proof of the fecond, our author
himfelf {hows that his art is not infallible, by fubftitut-
ing the word third inftead of fecond. Subftitutions of
this kind, he owns, may readily take place j but fuch
errors are much more confpicuous than literal ones,
though they may be corredted with equal eafe ; “ for
the erroneous fubftitution cannot fail of being nearly
equal in length to the word required } although, even
otherwife, it would not be attended with greater difad-
vantage than in the common way, and it would be rec-
tifted with greater facility.”
The eafe with which the compofftion -is performed,
{hows that there mult be an equal eafe in performing
the decompoAtion j “ from whence (fays Mr Johnfon)
it is further demonftrable, that any work can be com¬
pofed by this method nearly as foon as it can be deli¬
berately read j and as to the fifth pofition, that it {hall
not require a greater expence of types, it is anfwered,
that it is impoffible for more types of letters to be want¬
ed for this method than by any other printer according
to the equal quantity of bufinefs to be performed,
every office having certain known quantities of each
letter called a fount. A printer’s fount cpntains about
92,500 letters, and our want is not more; nay, nearer
the truth, the prefent quantity for a fount containing
much more of fome letters than necellary, and fewer
of others ; which arifes from the calculation of the
quantity of each letter wanted being adhered to fince
the old fpelling.”
Our author now proceeds to demonflrate that the
number of types muft neceffarily decreafe as they are
combined in fyllables, and much more when formed
into words. The whole art of arranging the words
confifts in placing them under as few divifions as pof-
fible, and {fill fewer fubdivifions $ which is attained by
the following procefs.
1. A colledlion of words,, with the addition of
tenfes, plurals, and degrees of comparifon, amounting
to more than 100,000, was made from the bell Engltih
dictionaries :
2. Collections were made from the mifeeiianeous part
X 2 of
logogra
phy.
/1< O G f i
• of 20 newfpapers, the Spectator, and Common Prayer¬
-book. The method was, by procuring duplicates of
every flieet, fo that each alternate fide might be parted
over with white paper, in order to leave the whole of
the words on both fides perfedt j and thus the whole
might be touched with lefs danger of injury than other-
xvife could have been done. The confufion arifina
from the parts of other words being feen from the
oppofite fide was likewife prevented.
3. The words, being feparately cut out, were then
put into a cafe marked with the divifions from one to
16, according to the number of letters contained in
each wrord. Thus feveral letters were diftindlly col-
ledfed ^ and then each feparate parcel forted in a cafe
containing 26 divifions, marked with the letters of
the alphabet, according to the commencing letter of
the.word} and thus all the wTords were ranged alpha¬
betically, confifting of two, three, four, or five letters,
in feparate parcels.
4. The fame words were then placed together, and
ported into an alphabet, with the number of times
marked to each that had occurred on the whole ; that
in this.manner a proportion might be determined how
many times particular words ought to be repeated for
the printing of one flieet, and alfo to know what
words are in general ufe : There are likewdfe a num¬
ber of technical terms, and favourite phrafes, a great
number of times repeated almoft by every author } but
though thefe occur throughout the whole book in
great proportion to the reft, no more of them will be
neceffary than what fuffice for a fingle ftieet.
5. The whole of the above might be done without
the trouble juft mentioned, by porting every word at
once into a triformed alphabet ; becaufe the fubdivi-
fions of the fecond and third commencing letter of
each word for references are now obtained, and thus
can ealily be placed in its proper divifion, and may be
marked as often as it occurs, without repeating the
fame word } whence w’e plainly fee the eafe and expe¬
dition of it, from the facility and expedition of porting
every word from a leaf in any book. Before fuch fub-
divifions were known, they could only have been pla¬
ced under the firft commencing letter of the wmrd }
which would caufe fuch a multiplicity of repetitions,
that it would take up more time, be far more liable
to. error, and require more fubordinate poftings to
bring them into arrangement} fo that they may be
found more eafily than by the above proceedings.
Thus alfo a colleftion will be obtained of fingle and
double words, which are conftantly required from 20 to
400 or 500 times in the printing one fheet of any work
whatever } and which alone would abridge the compofi-
tor’s work near one-third. This fecond procefs like¬
wife enabled the author to reje£f, out of the firft col-
leftion, obfolete words, technical terms, &c. which re¬
duces the original colle&ion to one-fifth part.
6. By proceeding in this manner, feveral fpecies of
words are omitted in the founts. 1. Obfolete words}
becaufe they occur fo feldom, that the difference of
time loft in compofing them in the ordinary method
would be imperceptible. 2. Technical terms, names
of places, animals, &c.} though, for any particular
work, the terms peculiar to it may be added to the
fount in a biformed alphabet apart. 3. Real com¬
pounds, or words that may be compounded of others,
64 ] LOG
are alfo rejected ; becaufe we actually have the words Logogra-
aiready, and they may be joined with fufficient expe- phy.
dition, though the fpaces are annexed to each, by ' "' "y
being conftruaed accordingly. 4. Thofe of the fame
fpelling.are likewife omitted, though they bear differ-
ent fignifications, for obvious reafons.
7. The variation of tenfes, degrees of comparifon,
and numerous words in the Engllrti language, having
in general, the fame terminations, fuch as ed, ing, ly,
MENT, NESS, &c. an alphabet may be formed of fuch
a kind as is capable of being annexed to the abfo-
lute words or radices, as expeditioufly as the whole
word could be found in the fount, from its being
thereby fo much lefs extended. Thus, by dividing fe¬
veral words into their radices and terminations, many
other words may be formed from their radix by the ad¬
dition of various terminations, and each termination
may be added to other radices to which they are ap¬
plicable.
8. Some radices are imperfeft, viz. fuch as end with
the vowel e, which muft therefore be added in the ufual
way.of compofition. Thus, in the word adore, the ra¬
dix is ador, to which the terminations es, ed, eji, eth
er, ing, may be added occafionally.
9. By rejecting alfo the words which come under this
laft denomination, the number neceflary for a fount is
reduced to one-tenth of what it would other wife be, as
will appear evident from the following confiderations :
I. There are at leaft 42 verbs, the infinitive of which
ends in ify ; as qualify, Jignify; the radices of which
are qual, Jign ; the terminations are, if.es, ifed, ifying,
&c. And Mr Johnfon informs us, that by applyino
thefe radices to other terminations, he was enabled to
difpenfe with more than 500 words which would other-
wife have been neceffary. 2. For all regular verbs, no
more than fix terminations are neceffary, viz. r, ef, eth,
ed, es, ing. There are but few irregular ones in the
Fnglifh language ; whence it happens that 12 or 14
words may be formed from one fingle perfeft verb as a
radix, and many imperfect ones fave double that num¬
ber.
10. By ufing only the fet of terminations which
may be contained in a box of two feet fquare, the
common operation of printing would be fhortened near¬
ly one half} and in order to find out thofe which are
mort in ufe, and fitteft to retain, our author digefted
them alphabetically, with the radices, words, or fyl-
lables, which make complete words annexed to them.
Thus,
_s 1 abs—apper—afeer
 ecj ^ de—dis—con
cer—cap—-cur
 ing r^r—cap-cur
 mentj enter—main—re—fus, &c.
11. Thus it will be found, that out of more than
100,000 words of which the Englilh language confifts,
there will not be wanted much above 3500 for a com¬
plete fount. This will be very evident to any perfon
who confults a dictionary. He will there find, that a
yaft number of words require an explanation} whereas
in any mifcellaneous work, there are none but what
can be underftood moft readily either together or apart.
Newfpapers retain more of the uncommon kind of words
than any others. “ The vocabulary (fays our author)
LOG [ 165 ] L O H
Logogra- or alphabet as it is called, of the Chinefe, confifts of
phj- above 80,000 letters or chara&ers; yet he is admitted
a mafter 0f the language who knows about 4000 of
them, no more being in general ufe.”
The expedition with which the logographic method
of printing can be accomplilhed, depends eflentially on
their arrangement 5 which, from great numbers of ex¬
periments, our author found to be bell accomplilhed
in the following manner : 1. Words of one, two, or
three fyllables, are alphabetically placed by themfelves,
including all poflible commencing fyllables, by w’hich
the compofitor cannot fail of finding the word either
in whole or in part, let it be w'hat it will j and when
the whole cannot be found at once, the remainder may
eafily be found in fingle or double fyllables among the
terminations. 2. All words above three fyllables have
the fame alphabetical arrangement $ the terminations
being the fame at the bottom of each. Experience
(hows, that by a very few leflbns, the meaneft capacity
may determine the number of fyllables, and refer to
the particular cafe containing words of that number,
there being confpicuous references to each •, and by
thus equalizing them, any perfon may poffefs himfelf
very expeditioully of what he wants. Even boys who
fcarcely knew more than the letters of the alphabet,
were hardly a fortnight employed in this method, when
they could at the firft glance tell the number of letters
contained in any word.
By this fimplicity of arrangement, any intelligent
perfon, who never compofed in his life, by being pla¬
ced in a room with the apparatus, could compofe and
print, without other previous inftruflion than defiring
him to remember that the words under three fyllables,
and thofe above three, are placed in feparate alphabets j
and that whenever he wants a wrord, the firft letter is
feen in capitals of twTo inches on the walls, the fecond
in letters of one inch in right lines j and where it is ne-
ceflary to have more columns than one for fuch fecond
letter, the third is given in red down the column, com¬
prehending about 12 divifions, to contain the types of
the word coming under fuch reference.
To exemplify this method as far as it can be done
without actually feeing the apparatus, our author inflan-
ces the two words Above and Unfortunately. In
looking for the former, the firft letter, A, is feen upon
the wall as already mentioned ; the fecond, B, is on
the cafe under it, and down that column is OVE,
oppofite to the cell containing the types of the whole
word ; which would be only three references inftead
of five with fpaces, as in the common method. The
other word, viz. Unfortunately, may be found by the
fame references, though it contains 13 letters j but
“ admitting that practice will give the word as foon
as a fingle letter, the average wfill be found eight for
one.”—Our author’s explanation of the method in
which this word might be compofed, how'ever, feems
by no means intelligible.—“ For this diftindtion in the
cafes (fays he), the alphabet, or rather marks of firft
reference in large charadlers on the wall, is divided into
turn claffes, not as vowels and confonants, but as fol¬
lows, viz. A, Con, Dif, E, In, O, P, S, Un, com¬
mencing references, the fecond or fubfequent letters of
the words being in a right line from left to right, and
down each column is found the remainder of the refe¬
rence to the words, diftinguilhing always the third let-
ter in red. The fecond diftindlion is that for all other Logogra-
commencing letters^ the fecond letter of reference is in
a column down, and the third letter in lines from left
to right in red. > , ~ J
Thefe are the diredfions given by our author for
forming a fount of words j the next requifite is a fount
of fyllables, formed in the following method : 1. A
complete fet of two letters was obtained in all their
poflible combinations, amounting to 676. 2. Having
next obtained the poflible combination of thefe letters,
viz. 17576, by retaining only all poflible fyllables, and
words of three letters, it is reduced to the 30th part,
which anfwer all the purpofes of compofing with fylla¬
bles of two and three letters, for Latin, French, Eng-
lifti, and all names of perfons, places, and things, every
poflible fyllable being comprehended among them.
Hence it forms an univerfal Informed alphabet, where
Englilh charadlers are ufed ; from •whence all partial
biformed and triformed alphabets in the arrangement of
Englifti, French, Latin, and all technical matters, are
drawn. Though combinations of four letters are
again 26 times the number of thofe of three letters,
and five letters increafe in the fame ratio j yet as much
as all poflible combinations increafe in quantity pro¬
portionate to the number of letters combined, fo they
decreafe in the adtual number of fyllablcs included
among them, infomuch, that all the fyllables of four,
five, fix, and feven letters together, are confiderably
fewer than the fyllables of three letters only.—Befides
the two founts already mentioned, a third was found ne-
ceflary for fuch terminations as are moft commonly fol¬
lowed by particular punctuations ; but, after fome con-
fideration, this wras judged unneceffary.
Our author nowT proceeds to obviate fome objections
which muft naturally occur to one who firft hears of his
invention. Thefe are,
1. A fingle letter damaged in a word renders the
whole ufelefs.
This is not denied by Mr Johnfon 4 but lie contends,
that the quantity of metal loft in this manner is quite
trifling.
2. How are the blanks or fpaces in a line to be ma¬
naged, as thefe are by no means equal
To this our author replies, that, at the time of writ¬
ing the pamphlet, he was undetermined whether it be
moft eligible to have fpaces call along with the begin¬
nings of words, or to fpaee them in the common man*
ner. The former would be more expeditious 5 and
where a greater diftance is required, other fpaces may
be introduced in the ordinary method.
3. How is a long word at the end of a line to be
divided ?
This may be eafily accompliflied by means of the fyl-
labic fount already mentioned.
4. How is the error of fubftituting one word for*
another to be reClified ?
The anfwer to this is, that an error of the kind fpe-
cified may be correfted in the very fame manner as is
done in common printing. Long words may be divided'
by means of the fyllabic fount already mentioned, and
the intervals between the words may be filled up with
fpaces as ufual.

LOLLARDS, in ecclefiaftical hillory, a religious
fed, differing in many religious points from the church
of Rome, which arofe in Germany about the begin¬
ning of the 14th century; fo called, as many writers
have imagined, from Walter Lollard, who began to
dogmatize in 1315, and was burnt at Cologn : though
others think that Lollard was no furname, but mere¬
ly a term of reproach applied to all heretics who con¬
cealed the poifon of error under the appearance of
piety.
The monk of Canterbury derives the origin of the
word Lollard among us, from lo/ium, “ a tare as if
the Lollards ;vere the tares fown in Chrift’s vineyard.
3
L O L
Abelly fays, that the word Lollard fignifies 11 praifing
God,” from the German loben, “ to praife,” and herr,
“ Lord ;” becaufe the Lollards employed themfelves
in travelling about from place to place, finging pfalms
and hymns.
Others, much to the fame purpofe, derive lollhard,
/ulI hard, or lollert, lullert, as it was written by the an¬
cient Germans, from the old German word Inllen, /al¬
ien, or /alien, and the termination hard, with which
many of the High Dutch words end. Lollen fignifies
“ to fing with a low voice,” and therefore Lollard
is a finger, or one who frequently fings j and in the
Lollards
vulgar tongue of the Germans it denotes a perfon who
is continually praifing God with a fong, or finging
hymns to his honour. The Alexians or Cellites were
called Lollards, becaufe they were public fipgers who
made it their bufinefs to inter the bodies of thofe who
died of the plague, and fang a dirge over them in a
mournful and indiliintt tone as they carried them to the
grave. The name was afterwards affumed by perfons
that difhonoured it ; for we find, among thofe Lollards
who made extraordinary pretences to piety and religion,
and fpent the greateft part of their time in meditation,
prayer, and fuch afls of piety, there were many abo¬
minable hypocrites, who entertained the molt ridiculous
opinions and concealed the moll enormous vices under
the fpecious mark of this extraordinary profeffion. And
many injurious afperfions were propagated againll thofe
who affumed this name by the priefts and monks; fo
that, by degrees, any perfon who covered herefies or
crimes under the appearance of piety, was called a Lol¬
lard. Thus the name was not ufed to denote any one
particular fe£l, but was formerly common to all perfons
and all fefts who were fuppofed to be guilty of impiety
towards God or the church, under an external profef¬
fion of extraordinary piety. However, many focieties
confining both of men and women under the name of
Lollards, were formed in moll parts of Germany and
Flanders, and were fupported partly by their manual la¬
bours, and partly by the charitable donations of pious
perfons. The magillrates and inhabitants of the towns
where thefe brethren and fillers refided, gave them
particular marks of favour and proteflion, on account
of their great ufefulnefs to the fick and needy. They
were thus fupported againft their malignant rivals, and
obtained many papal conftitutions by which their in-
llitute was confirmed, their perfons exempted from
the cognizance of the inquifitors, and fubjefled en¬
tirely to the jurifdiff ion of the bilhops; but as thefe
meafures were infufficient to fecure them from mo-
lefiation, Charles duke of Burgundy, in the year
1472, obtained a folemn bull from Pope Sixtus IV.
ordering that the Cellites or Lollards Ihould be rank¬
ed among the religious orders, and delivered from the
jurifditlion of the bilhops ; and Pope Julius II. grant¬
ed them yet greater privileges in the year 1506. Mo-
Iheim informs us that many locieties of this kind are
Hill fubfilling at Cologn, and in the cities of Flanders,
though they have evidently departed from their ancient
rules.
Lollard and his followers rejefled the facrifice of
the mafs, extreme un£lion, and penances for fin ; ar¬
guing, that Chrift’s fufferings were fufficient. He is
likewife faid to have fet afide baptifin, as a thing of

LOMBARDS, a Scandinavian nation, who former¬
ly fettled in Italy, and for fome time made a confider-
t able figure.
Their name of Lombards, or Longobards, is by fome
derived from the word lack, or lache, fignifying in the
German tongue winter; becaufe the Lombards, while
in Scandinavia, lived in marfhes, or near the fea. Others
think that it comes from the two German words langen
harden, or helleborden, that is, from the long halberts
they were fuppofed to ufe in w’ar. But Paulus Dia-
conus their hillorian, and who was himfelf a Lombard,
tells us that they were called Longobards from the
length of their beards. A nation called the Lombards
is mentioned by Tacitus, Strabo, and Ptolemy j but
thefe are different from the Lombards who afterwards
fettled in Italy, and are reckoned to be the fame with
the Gepidae, whom the Italian Lombards almoft ex¬
terminated. The Lombards who fettled in Italy are
firft mentioned by Profper Aquitanus, bilhop of Rhe-
Vandalsde-gium in the year 379. That writer tells us, that
feated by about this time the Lombards, abandoning the moft
diftant coafts of the ocean, and their native country
Scandinavia, and feeking for new fettlements, as they
were overftocked with people at home, firft attacked
and overcame the Vandals in Germany. They were
then headed by two chiefs, Iboreus and Aion } who,
dying about the year 389, w^ere fucceeded by Agil-
mund, who is commonly reckoned the firft king of the
3 Lombards.

Ruhuis 6 on Danube, in the country of the
* ns' Rugiaos, whom Odoacer had almoft totally extermi¬
nated or carried into captivity. During their ftay in
this country, they rendered themfelves formidable to
the neighbouring nations, and carried on fuccefsful
wars with the Heruli and Gepidae. In 526, they
were allowed by the emperor Juftinian to fettle in
^ Pannonia; and here they made war a fecond time

Gepids. ed the king of the Gepidae with his owrn hand, put his
army to the rout, and cut fuch numbers of them in
pieces, that they ceafed from that time to be a nation.
Having caufed the deceafed king’s head to be cut off,
he made a cup of his fkull, called in the language of
the Lombards fchala, which he made ufe of in all public
entertainments. However, having taken, among many

daughter, by name Rofamunda, he married her after Lombards,
the death of his former wife Clodifvinta, the daughter '—■'V’—-'
of Clotaire king of France.
By this viflory Alboinus gained fuch reputation
that his friendfhip wTas courted by Juftinian ; and, in
confequence of the emperor’s application, a body of
6000 Lombards were fent to the affiftancc of Narfes
againft the Goths. The fuccefs of the Romans in
this expedition, the invafien of Italy by the Lombards,
and their fucceffes in that country, have been taken
notice of under the article Italy, N° 28—32. At 5
laft Alboinus, having made himfelf mailer of Venetia, Alboinus
Liguria, Emilia, Hetruria, and Umbria, was ftain byk,nSof^he
the treachery of his wife, in the year 575, the fourth affaffimited
of his reign. This princefs was the daughter of the at the infti-
king of the Gepidae, whom Alboinus had killed ingationof
battle, and made a cup of his Ikull, as above related.wife•
As he was one day feafting at Verona, with his chief
favourites and principal officers, in the height of his
mirth he fent for the queen, and, filling the detefted
cup, commanded her to drink merrily with her father.
Rofamund, ftruck with horror, hurried out of the
room } and highly incenfed againft her hulband for
thus barbaroufly triumphing over the misfortunes of
her family, refolved, at all events, to make him pay
dear for fuch an inhuman and affronting condutt.
Accordingly, fhe difcovered her intention to Helmi-
child the king’s fhield-bearer, a youth of great bold-
nefs and intrepidity. Helmichild peremptorily refufed
to imbrue his hands in the blood of his fovereign, or
to be any way acceffory to his death} and in this re-
folution he perfifted, till he was, by a lhameful ftrata-
gem, forced by the queen to a compliance : for the,
knowing that he carried on an intrigue with one of
her ladies, placed herfelf one night in her bed, and
receiving the youth, indulged him as if Ihe had been
his own miftrefs in his amorous defires ; which fhe had
no fooner done, than difcovering herfelf to the de¬
ceived lover, Ihe told him that he mull now either put
the king to death, or be put to death by him. Hel¬
michild, well apprifed, that, after what he had done,
his fafety depended upon the death of the king, engaged
in the treafon, which he otherwife abhorred. One day,
therefore, while Alboinus was repofing in his chamber
after dinner, Helmichild, with fome others whom he
had made privy to his defign, breaking in unexpeftedly,
fell upon the king wdth their daggers. Alboinus Halt¬
ing up at their firft coming in, laid hold of his fword,
which he had always by him } but having in vain at¬
tempted to draw it, the queen having before-hand
faftened it in the fcabbard, he defended hirofelf for
fome time with a footftool} but was in the end over- -
powered, and defpatched with many wounds.
Rofamund had promifed to Helmichild, that, as
foon as he had defpatched the king, fhe would marry
him, and, with her perfon, beftow upon him the king¬
dom of the Lombards. The firft part of her promife
Ihe immediately performed ; but was fo far from being
able to beftow the crown upon him, that both of them
were obliged to fave themfelves by flight. They fled
to Longinus the exarch of Ravenna, taking with them
all the jewels and treafure of the late king. Longinus
received her wuth the greateft marks of friendlhip and
kindnefs, and affured her of his prote&ion. She had
not been long in Ravenna, however, before the exarch,

his defign to her, and declared his intention to marry
her, provided, by fome means or other, fhe defpatehed
Helmichild.—Rofamund, highly pleafed with the pro-
pofal, refolved to fatisfy her ambition by getting rid
of the perfon whom fhe had married in order to gra¬
tify her revenge. Accordingly, having prepared a
ftrong poifon, fhe mixed it with wane, and gave it to
her hufband as he came out of the bath, and called for
drink, according to his cullom. Helmichild had not
half emptied the cup, when, by the hidden and ftrange
operation which he felt in his bowels, he concluded
what it w as ; and, with his fword pointed at the queen’s
breaft, compelled her to drink the reft. The poifon
had the fame effeiSl on both for they died in a few
hours. Longinus, on the death of the queen, laid
afide all thoughts of making himfelf king of Italy,
and fent the king’s treafure to Conftantinople, together
wdth Albifoinda, the daughter of Alboinus by Rofa¬
mund, whom fhe had brought alone with her.
After the death of Alboinus, the Lombards chofe
Clephis, one of the nobility, for their king. He was
murdered after a fhort reign of 18 months ; upon which
enfued an interregnum of io years, as related under
the article Italy, N° 32. During this time, they
extended their conquefts in that country •, but at laft
the Romans, jealous of their progrefs, refolved to put
a flop to their viftories, and, if poflible, to drive them
quite out. For this purpofe, they defigned not only
to employ their own force, but entered into alliance
with the Franks; which fo alarmed the Lombards
that they re-eftablifhed the monarchical form of go¬
vernment among themfelves, and chofe Autharis the
fon of Clephis for their king. This monarch, confi-
dering that the power of the dukes, who had governed
Lombardy for the fpace of 10 years, was during that
length of time very much eftabliihed, and that they
would not probably be walling to part with the au¬
thority which they had fo long enjoyed, allowed them
to continue in their government j but obliged them to
contribute one moiety of their revenues towards the
maintenance and fupport of his royal dignity, fuffer-
ing them to difpofe of the other as they thought pro¬
per. He referved to himfelf the fupreme dominion
and authority 5 and took an oath of the dukes, that
in time of war, they would readily affift him to the
utmoft of their power. Though he could remove the
dukes at pleafure, yet he deprived none of them of
their dukedoms, except in cafes of treafon j nor gave
them to others, except when their male iffue failed.
Having fettled matters in this manner with the dukes,
he enadted feveral wholefome laws againft theft, ra¬
pine, murder, adultery, and other vices wdiich prevailed
among his fubjedls, and was the firft of the Lombard
kings who embraced Chriftianity. Moft of his fubjedls
followed the example of their monarch 5 but as they
were all inftrucled by Arian bilhops, they continued
long infefted with that herefy •, which occafioned great
difputes between them and the orthodox biftiops of the
cities fubjedl to them.
From the re-eftaolifhment of the monarchy under
Autharis. to the reign of Rotharis in 636, the hiftory
of the Lombards affords nothing memorable. This
period is remarkable for the introdudlion of written
Before his time they had Lombard.?,
been governed only by tradition : but Rotharis, in imi- ^
tation of the Romans and Goths, undertook the pub-
lifhing of written law’s ; and to thofe which he enadled,
many w’ere added by the fucceeding princes. Grotius
prefers the method w’hich the Lombards followed in
making laws, to that which was pradlifed by the Ro¬
mans themfelves. Among the latter the emperor was
the foie lawgiver j fo that whatever pleafed him had
the force of a law\ But the Lombard kings did not
affume that power to themfelves, fince their laws were
enadled in public affemblies, convened for that purpofe,
after they had been maturely examined and approved
of by all the lords of the kingdom. From thefe affem¬
blies were excluded the ecclefiaftic order, and the peo¬
ple : fo that the legiflative power was lodged in the
king and nobles alone.
The reign of Rotharis is remarkable, not only for
his introducing written laws among his fubjedls, but
for the conquefts he made, and the fuccefsful wars
carried on with the exarch of Ravenna, whom he
totally defeated in feveral engagements, and made
himfelf mafter of fome part of his territories. This
monarch died in 6525 and the affairs of the Lombards
went on profperoufly, till the ambition of Luitprand
laid the foundation of the total ruin of his kingdom. lQ
He afeended the throne of Lombardy in 711, and Luitr^imd’s
watched all opportunities of enlarging his dominions at ambition,
the expence of the emperor’s. Of this, a fair oppor¬
tunity offered in 716: for the emperor Leo Ifauricus,
who at that time reigned in the eaft, having, by his
famous edift, forbidden the worfhip of images, and
ordered them to be everywhere pulled down, the
people were fo provoked at that innovation, that, in
feveral places, they openly revolted, and, falling up¬
on the emperor’s officers, drove them out of the cities.
In the eaft, Germanus, patriarch of Conftantinople,
oppofed the emperor’s defign with great warmth j but
Leo caufed him to be depofed, and Anaftafius to be
raifed to that fee in his room, ordering at the fame
time all the images in the imperial city to be pulled
down and publicly burnt. He ftri&ly enjoined his
officers in the weft, efpecially the exarch of Ravenna,
to fee his edi£l punftually obeyed in their refpeftive
governments. In compliance with thefe orders, Scho-
lafticus, then exarch, began to pull down the images
in all the churches and public places in Ravenna;
which incenfed the fuperftitious multitude to fuch a
degree, that taking arms, they openly declared they
wmuld rather renounce their allegiance to the emperor
than the worftiip of images.
Thus a kind of civil war being kindled in the city,
Luitprand thought he had now a favourable opportu¬
nity of making himfelf mafter of the feat of the exarch,
not doubting but the conqueft of fuch an important
place would be followed by that of the whole ex- Xl
archate. Having therefore drawn together all his He befieges
forces, he unexpectedly appeared before Ravenna, and and at iait
clofely befieged it. The exarch little expefted fuch atakes Ra'
furprife, as a friendly correfpondence had been main¬
tained for many years between the exarchs and the
Lombard kings. However, he defended the place
with fuch courage and refolution, that Luitprand,
defpairing of fuccefs, broke up the fiege and led his
army againft Claflis, at a fmall diftance from Ravenna,

Lombards, which he took, plundered, and levelled
ground. The lofs of this place, and the fevere treat¬
ment the inhabitants met with from the king, threw
the citizens of Ravenna into the utmoft confternation ;
which Luitprand being informed of, he refolved to
take advantage of their fears, and, returning before
Ravenna while the inhabitants were thus difheartened,
to attempt once more the redudfion of that place.
Accordingly he led his whole army againft it, and,
by frequent attacks, tired the inhabitants and garri-
fon to fuch a degree, that the exarch, finding they
could hold out no longer, and defpairing of relief,
privately withdrew. Luitprand, informed of his re¬
treat, attacked the town with more violence than ever j
and, having carried it by ftorm, gave it to.be plunder¬
ed by his foldiers, who found in it an immenfe booty,
as it had been for a long time the feat of the Roman
emperors, of the Gothic kings, and the exarchs. The
king ftripped it of moft of its valuable monuments of
antiquity, and caufed, among the reft, an equeftrian
ftatue of an emperor, of wonderful workmanftiip, to be
conveyed to Pavia, where it is to be feen to this day.
The redu&ion of Ravenna was followed by the furrend-
er of feveral cities of the exarchate, which Luitprand re¬
duced to a dukedom ; appointing Hildebrand his grand-
fon to govern it with the title of duke : and giving him,
as he was yet an infant, Peredeus duke of Vicenza for
his guardian.
The conqueft of Ravenna and the greater part of
the exarchate did not a little alarm Gregory II. bi-
fhop of Rome. He was then at variance wdth the
emperor, whofe edift againft the worftiipping of ima¬
ges he had oppofed with all his might, and by that
means provoked Leo to fuch a degree, that he had
threatened to drive him from the fee, and fend him in¬
to exile. However, the pope, no lefs jealous of the
potver of the Lombards than all his predecefibrs had
been, refolved, by feme means or other, to put a flop
to their conquefts. The only prince in Italy to whom
he could have recourfe w7as Urfus duke of Venice,
the Venetians making already no inconfiderable figure.
The exarch ^ ° accordingly he wrote a very preffing letter j
conjuring him to aftift his worthy fon the exarch, and,
for the love of the holy faith, to attempt with him
the recovery of the exarchate, w'hich the wicked na¬
tion of the Lombards had unjuftly taken from his fons
Leo and Conftantine emperors. Urfus and the Ve¬
netians, moved with the pope’s letter, and at the fame
time greatly alarmed at the growth of fo powerful a
neighbour, promifed to aflift the exarch with the w-hole
flrength of their republic ; and accordingly fitted out
a confiderable fleet, pretending it was defigned for thd
fervice of the emperor againft the Saracens. At the
fame time the exarch, who had taken refuge in Ve¬
nice, abandoning that place, as it were in ‘defpair of
bringing the duke over to his party, raifed, in the
places ftill fubjefl to the emperor, what forces he was
able 5 and having got together a confiderable body,
he marched with them towards Imola, giving out that
he deligned to befiege that city 5 but turning on a
hidden towards Ravenna, as had been agreed on be¬
tween him and the Venetians, he laid fiege to it by
land, while they invefted it alrnoft at the iame infant
by fea. Peredeus defended the town for fome time
with great courage and refolution : obliging all thefe

the Venetians having, in fpite of all oppofition, forced v ‘
open one of the gates on the fide of the fea, the city wh0 retake
was taken, and Peredeus flain, while he was attempt-Ravenna,
ing, at the head of a choice body, to drive the enemy
from the polls they had feized. As for Hildebrand,
he fell into the hands of the Venetians j who, having
thus recovered Ravenna to the emperor, returned home,
leaving the exarch in poffeflion of the city. Luitprand
was then at Pavia j but the town wTas taken before he
could affemble his troops to relieve it.
And now Gregory bifhop of Rome, to whom the
recovery of Ravenna was chiefly owing, perfuading
himfelf, that the emperor would, out of gratitude,
give ear to his remonftrances and admonitions, began
to folicit him with more prefling letters than ever to
revoke his edi£l againft the worfhip of images: but
Leo, well apprifed that the bifhop, in all the mea-
fures he had taken, had been more influenced by a re¬
gard to his own intereft than to that of the empire,
inftead of hearkening to his remonftrances, was ftill
more provoked againft him for thus obftinately oppof-
ing the execution of his edidl. Being, therefore, re¬
folved at all events to have it obferved in Rome itfelf,
and, on the other hand, not doubting but the pope
would oppofe it to the laft with all his might*, in order
to remove all obftacles, he fent three officers to Rome,
with private orders, either to defpatch the pope, or to
take him prifoner and convey him to Conftantinople.
At the fame time, he wrote to Mauritius duke of
Rome, fecretly enjoining him to affift his three officers
in their undertaking : but no favourable opportunity
offering to put their defign in execution, the emperor,
in the year 725, recalled Scholafticus, and fent Paul
a patrician into Italy, to govern in his room, with pri¬
vate inftrmftions to encourage the above-mentioned of¬
ficers with the promife of great rewards, and to af-
fure them of his protedlion.
But, in the mean time, the plot was difeovered, and
two of the confpirators were apprehended by the citizens
of Rome, and put to death ■, the third having efcaped
into a monaftery, where he took the monaftic habit
and ended his days. Hereupon the exarch, in com¬
pliance with the emperor’s orders," refolved to proceed
no longer by fecret plots, but by open force. Accord¬
ingly, be drew together a confiderable body of troops,
and fet out at the head of them on his march to Rome,
with a defign to feize on the pope, and fend him, as he 15
had engaged to do, in chains to Conftantinople. But, Luitprand
on this occafion, Luitprand, though highly provoked t^e
againft Gregory for having ftirred up the Venetians
againft him, yet refolved to affift him and the citizens exarch,
of Rome againft the exarch, iw order to keep the ba¬
lance even between them, and by affifting fometimes the
one and fometimes the other, weaken both. Purfuant
to this refolution, he ordered the Lombards of Tuf-
cany, and thofe of the dukedom of Spoletto, to join
the pope and the inhabitants of Rome ; who, being
by this reinforcement far fuperior in ftrength and num¬
ber to the exarch, obliged him to return to Ravenna,
and give over all thoughts of any further attempt on
the perfon of the pope.
In the mean time, Leo, perfifting in his former re¬
folution of fuppreffing throughout his dominions the
worfhip of images, fent frelh orders to the exarch
Y Paul.

lombards. Paul, rlriftly enjoining him to caufe his edi6l to be put
* 'r in execution in all the cities of Italy under his empire,
efpecially in Rome. At the fame time, he wrote to the
pope, promifing him his favour and proteftion if he
complied with the edi£l; and declaring him, if he con¬
tinued to oppofe it, a rebel, and no longer vefled with
the papal dignity. But Gregory was fo far from
yielding to the emperor’s threats, or promifes, that, on
the contrary, he folemnly excommunicated the exarch
for attempting to put the imperial ediff in execution :
and at the fame time wrote circular letters to the Ve¬
netians, to King Luitprand, to the Lombard dukes,
and to all the chief cities of the empire, exhorting
them to continue ftedfaft in the Catholic faith, and to
oppofe with all their might fuch a deteftable innova¬
tion. rI hefe letters made fuch an impreffion on the
minds of the people in Italy, that though of different
intereds, and often at war with one another, they all
united j protefling they wrould defend the Catholic
faith, and the life of the pope, in fo glorious a caufe,
at the expence of their own $ nay, the citizens of
1 Rome, and the inhabitants of Pentapolis, now Marca
d’Ancona, not contenting themfelves wdth fuch a pro-
teflation, openly revolted from the emperor ; and,
pulling down his ffatues, they eledled, by their own
authority, mpgiilrates to govern them during the in¬
terregnum. We are even told, that, tranfported with
a blind zeal, they wTere for choofing a new emperor,
and conducing him to Conftantinople, not doubting
but the people would everywhere join them. But the
pope, thinking this refolution unfeafonable, and not
to be eafily put in execution, oppofed it j fo that it
did not take place.
In the mean time, the exarch Paul, having gained
a confiderable party in Ravenna, began, purfuant to
the repeated orders from the emperor, to remove the
images, as fo many idols, out of the churches. Here-
16 upon the adverfe party, fupported and encouraged by
A civil wa! the pope, flew to arms: and, falling upon the icono-
dojis, or image-breakers, as they ftyled them, gave rife
to a civil war within the walls of Ravenna. Great num¬
bers were killed on both fides : but thofe who were for
the w'orfliip of imr^es prevailing in the end, a dread¬
ful daughter was made of the oppofite party y and,
among the reft, the exarch himfelf wras murdered.
However, the city of Ravenna continued faithful to
the emperor j but moft of the cities of Romagna be¬
longing to the exarchate, and all thofe of Pentapolis
or La Marca d’Ancona, abhorring the emperor as an
heretic, fubmitted to Luitprand king of the Lombards j
who, pretending a zeal for the Catholic religion, took
care to improve the difcontent of the people to his
advantage, by reprefenting to them, that they could
never maintain their religious rights under a prince,
who was not only an heretic, but a perfecutor of the
orthodox.
In Naples, Exhilaratus, duke of that city, having
received peremptory orders from the emperor to caufe
his edift to be put in execution, did all that hiy in his
power to perfuade the people to receive it 5 but find¬
ing all his endeavours thwarted by the biihop of Rome,
for whom the Neapolitans had a great veneration, he
hired affaffins to murder him. But the plot being dif-
cevered, though carried on wdth great fecrecy, the
Neapolitans, highly provoked againft the duke, tore
both him and his fon to pieces, and likewife put to
death one of his chief officers, w’ho had compofed a
libel againft the pope. Luitprand, and Gregory at
that time duke of Benevento, laying hold of fo fa-
vourable an opportunity to make themfelves mafters
of the dukedom of Naples, did all that lay in their
power to perfuade the Neapolitans to fubmit to them.
But the Neapolitans, bearing an irreconcilable ha¬
tred to the Lombards, with whom they had been con-
ftantly at variance, rejedted every overture of that na¬
ture with the utmoft indignation; and, continuing
ftedfaft in their allegiance to Leo, received from Con-
ftantinople one Peter, wdio was fent to govern them in
the room of Exhilaratus. Some writers fuppofe the
Neapolitans, in this general revolt of the cities of Italy,
to have fhaken off the yoke with the reft, and to have
appointed magiftrates of their own eledlion to govern
them, in the room of the officers hitherto fent from
Conftantinople, or named by the exarch : but they
are certainly miftaken ; it being manifeft from hiftory,
that Peter fucceeded Exhilaratus in that dukedom,
and that the Neapolitans continued to live under the
emperors, till they were conquered many years after
by the Normans.
In the mean time, Leo hearing of the murder of the
exarch, and the general revolt of the cities, and not
doubting but the pope was the chief author of fo much
mifehief, fent the eunuch Eutychius into Italy, with
the title and authority of exarch, ftriftly enjoining
him to get the pope defpatched by fome means or
other, fmee his death was abfolutely neceffary for the
tranquillity of Italy. The exarch fpared no pains to
get the pope into his power : but a meffenger, whom
he had fent to Rome, being apprehended by the citi¬
zens, and an order from the emperor being found up¬
on him to all his officers in that city, commanding
them to put the pope to death at all events, the pope’s
friends thenceforth guarded him with fuch care, that
the exarch’s emiffaries could never afterwards find an
opportunity of executing their defign. As for the mef¬
fenger, the Romans were for putting him to death ;
but the pope interpofed, contenting himfelf with ex¬
communicating the exarch..
And now the Romans, provoked more than ever
againft Leo, and, on the other hand, unwilling to
live under the Lombards, refolved to revolt from the
emperor, and appoint their own magiftrates, keeping
themfelves united under the pope, not yet as their
prince, but only as their head. This they did ac¬
cordingly ; and from thefe (lender beginnings the fo-
vereignty of the popes in Italy took its rife, though
they did not then, as is commonly fuppofed by hifto-
rians, but many years after, become fovereign lords
of Rome.
Eutychius failed in his defign upon the life of the
pope 5 but having brought with him from Conftantin¬
ople a good number of troops, he eafily quelled the
rebellion in Ravenna, and feverely punilhed the au¬
thors of the late difturbances. As for the rebellious
Romans, he was well apprifed he could never reduce
them, fo long as they were fupported by the king of
the Lombards $ and therefore he employed all his art
and policy to take oft that prince from the party of
the Romans, and bring hirn over to his own.

junfture, the exarch, laying hold of that opportuni¬
ty, offered to affuf the king with all his ftrength a-
gainft the rebellious duke, provided he would, in like
manner, affift him againft the pope and the Romans.
With this propofal Luitprand readily clofed j and a
league being concluded upon thefe terms between him
and the exarch, the two armies joined, and began
their march towards Spoletto. At their approach, the
duke, defpairing of being able to reiift two fuch
powers, came out with a fmall attendance to meet
them, and, throwing himfelf at the king’s feet, fued,
in that humble poiture, for pardon ; which Luitprand
not only granted him, but confirmed him in the duke¬
dom, after he had obliged him to take a new oath of
allegiance, and give hoftages for his fidelity in time
to come. From Spoletto, the two armies marched,
in purfuance of the treaty, to Rome } and encamped
in the meadows of Nero, between the liber and the
Vatican.
Gregory had caufed the city of Rome to be fortified
in the bell manner he could j but being fenfible that
the Romans alone could not long hold out againft two
fuch armies, and reflefting on the kind treatment the
duke of Spoletto had met with upon his fubmitting to
the king, he refolved to follow his example : and ac¬
cordingly, taking with him fome of the clergy, and
the principal inhabitants of the city, he went to wait
on the king in his camp ; and there, with a pathetic
fpeech, as he was a great mafter of eloquence, foften-
ed Luitprand to fuch a degree, that, throwing him¬
felf at his feet in the prefence of the whole army, he
begged pardon for entering into an alliance againft
him : and, affuring him of his proteftion for the fu¬
ture, he went with them to the church of St Peter ;
and there, difarming himfelf in the prefence of his
chief officers, he laid his girdle, his fword, and his
gauntlet, with his royal mantle, his crown of gold, and
crofs of filver, on the apoftle’s fepulchre. After this,
he reconciled the pope with the exarch, who was
thereupon received into the city, where he continued
for fome time, maintaining a friendly correfpondence
with the pope. At th?s time an impoftor, taking the
name of Tiberius, and pretending to be defeended from
the emperors, feduced a great many people in ,luf-
cany, and was by them proclaimed emperor. The
exarch, refblved to march againft him ; but as he had
not fufficient forces to oppofe the rebels, Gregory, who
let no opportunity flip of obliging Leo, perfuaded the
Romans to attend the exarch in this expedition •, by
which means the ufurper being taken in a caftle, his
head was fent to the emperor, and the rebellion utter¬
ly fuppreffed. But the emperor ftill infilling upon his
edi£t againft the images being received in Rome, the
Romans, at the inftigation of the pope, publicly re¬
nounced their allegiance to Leo, paid him no more
tribute, and withdrew for ever their obedience to the
emperors of the Eaft.
Leo, informed of this revolt, and not queftioning
but the pope was the author of it, immediately caufed
all the patrimonies of the church of Rome ^in Sicily,
Calabria, and his other dominions, to be confifcated.
At the fame time, he ordered a powerful army to be
raifed, with a defign to recover the towns that had re¬
volted ; to chaftife the Romans for their rebellion 5 and,

above all, to he revenged on the pope, who had raif- Lombard-.
ed all thefe difturbances, by himlelf oppofing, and
perfuading others to oppofe, the execution of his e-
dich Gregory, alarmed at the warlike preparations
that were carrying on throughout the empire, and
well apprifed that they were chiefly defigned againft
him and the Romans, refolved to recur to the pro-
teftion of the French, the only nation at that time
capable of coping with the emperor, and on. whom,
on account of their zeal for religion, he thought he
might depend. The Lombards were then very power¬
ful ; but, as they wanted to be mafters of Rome,
he did not think it advifable to truft them. The Ve¬
netians, though zealous in the defence of the pope,
were not yet in a condition to withlland the power of
the emperor •, and, befides, were jealous of the Lom¬
bards, who watched all opportunities of enlarging
their dominions at the expence of their neighbours.
As for Spain, it wras then in a moft deplorable condi¬
tion, being overrun, and almoft w’holly ruined, by the
Saracens. 21
The French nation wTas at this time governed by Who ap-
the celebrated Charles Martel, who had diftinguiftied P^to the
himfelf in a moft eminent manner in the wars ox'
France and Germany ; and had, not long before,
gained a fignal victory over the Saracens in the neigh¬
bourhood of Tours ; whence he was generally reput¬
ed the beft commander, and the greateft hero, of his
time. To him, therefore, Gregory fent a folemn em-
baffy, with a great number of relics, earneftly en¬
treating him to take the Romans, and the church, un¬
der his proteftion, and defend them againft the at¬
tempts of Leo. The ambaffadors were received with
extraordinary marks of honour j and a treaty was foon
concluded between them and Charles, wTho engaged to
march into Italy in perfon, at the head of a power¬
ful army, in defence of the Romans and the church,
if they fhould be attacked either by the emperor 01 the
Lombards. On the other hand, the Romans were to
acknowledge him for their proteftor, and confer on
him the honour of the confulfhip, as it had been for¬
merly conferred on Clovis by the emperor Anaftaiius,
after that prince had defeated the Vifigoths. The am¬
baffadors returned from France loaded wnth rich pre-
fents. But Gregory did not long enjoy the fruit of
their negociations j for he died the fame year 73 L
and was fucceeded by Gregory III. in whofe time fome
place the above-mentioned embaffy.
The French nation was at this time juft recovered End of the
from its diftreffed fituation under the defeendants of1 °mt>ard
Clovis } and by the bravery and conduft of Charlesm0narc
Martel, had become the moft powerful kingdom in
the weft. His fucceffor Pepin was no lefs wife and
powerful than his father had been •, and as the ambi¬
tion of the Lombard princes would be fatisfied with
nothing lefs than the entire conqueft of Italy, the
French monarch, Charlemagne, under colour of aflift-
ing the pope, at laft put an end to the empire of
Lombardy, as related under the article France,

them. Under the government of the Lombards (fays
Paulus Diaconus) no violence was committed, no one
unjuftly difpofTefied of his property, none opprefied
with taxes j theft, robberies, murder, and adultery,
were feldom heard of: every one wrent, without the
Jeaft apprehenfion, wherever he pleafed. Their laws
were fo juft and equitable, that they were retained in
Italy, and obferved there fome ages after their king¬
dom was at an end.—According to Paulus Diaconus,
alfo, their drefs was loofe, and for the moft part of
linen, fuch as the Anglo-Saxons wore, being inter¬
woven with various colours; that their fhoes were
open to the end of their foot, and that they ufed to
button or lace them. From fome ancient paintings,
it appears, that they fhaved the back part of their
heads, but that their hair was long before; their
locks being parted, and laid on each fide their fore-
heads.
LOME ART, or Lombard, Peter, an engraver
of conliderable eminence, who flouriihed about the
year 1660. He was a native of Paris, where he learn¬
ed the art of engraving. It appears that he came to
England before the revolution, becaufe fome of his
plates for Engliih publications are dated prior to that
event. He executed a vaft variety of plates, as well
hiftorical as emblematical ; which, however, were
chiefly for books. But his beft works are portraits ;
and of thefe he produced a confiderable number, wdiich
are efteemed. They are moftly after Vandyck.—He
alfo engraved hiftorical fubjedls, from Pouflin, Raphael,
Annibal Carracci, Guido, and other mafters.

Loch-LOMOND, a large lake of Dunbarton or
Lennox-lhire in Scotland, of which Mr Pennant gives
the following defcription. “ Loch-Lomond, the laft,
the moft beautiful of the Caledonian lakes. The firft
view of it from Tarbet prefents an extenfive ferpentine
winding amidft lofty hills ; on the north, barren,
black, and rocky, which darken with their Ihade that
contradfted part of the w’ater. On the weft fide, the
mountains are clothed near the bottoms with woods
of oak quite to the water edge ; their fummits lofty,
naked, and craggy. On the eaft fide, the mountains
are equally high; but the tops form a more even ridge
parallel to the lake, except where Ben-Lomond, like
Saul amidft his companions, overtops the reft. The
upper parts were black and barren ; the lower had
great marks of fertility, or at leaft of induftry, for the
yellow corn was finely contrafted with the verdure of
the groves intermixed with it.
“ This eaftern boundary is part of the Grampian
hills, wThich extend from hence through the counties of
Perth, Angus, Mearns, and Aberdeen. The road runs
fometimes through woods 5 at others is expofed and
haked ; in fome, fo fteep as to require the fupport of

exchange of inltrumeots of deftru&ion, for thofe that
72 ] L O M
give fafety to the traveller, and a poli!h to the once Loch-
inacceffible native ! Two great headlands covered with
trees feparate the firft fcene from one totally different: Lomo‘!ozof;
the laft is called the Point of Firkin. On palling this
cape an expanfe of water burfts at once on your eye,
varied with all the fofter beauties of nature. Imme¬
diately beneath is a flat covered with wood and corn :
beyond, the headlands ftretch far into the water, and
confift of gentle rifings ; many have their furfaces co¬
vered with wood, others adorned with trees loofely
fcattered either over a fine verdure or the purple bloom
of the heath. Numbers of iflands are difperfed over
the lake, of the fame elevated form as the little capes,
and wooded in the fame manner ; others- juft peep a-
bove the furface, and are tufted with trees j and num¬
bers are fo difpofed as to form magnificent viftos be¬
tween.
“ Oppofite Lufs, at a fmall diftance from ihore, is a
mountainous ifle almoft covered with wood ; it is near
half a mile long, and has a moft fine effeft. I could
not count the number of iflands, but was told there
are 28 ; the largeft two miles long, and ftocked with
deer.
“ The length of this charming lake is 24 miles j
its greateft breadth 8 ; its greateft depth, which is be¬
tween the point of Firkin and Benlomond, is 1 20 fa-
thonis. Befides the fifti common to the lochs are gui-
niads, called here poans.
“ The furface of Loch-lomond has for feveral years
paft been obferved gradually to increafe, and invade the
adjacent fliore: and there is reafon to fuppofe that
churches, houfes, and other buildings, have been loft
in the water. Near Lufs is a large heap of ftones at
a diftance from the ftiore, known by the name of the
old church j and about a mile to the fouth of that, in
the middle of a large bay, between Camftraddan and
the ifle Inch-tavanack, is another heap, faid to have
been the ruins of a houfe. To confirm this, it is
evident by a paffage in Camden’s Atlas Britannica,
that an ifland, exiiling in his time, is now loft 5 for
he fpeaks of the ifle of Camftraddan, placed between
the lands of the fame name and Inch-tavanack, in
which, adds he, was an houfe and orchard. Befides
this proof, large trees wfith their branches ftill ad¬
hering are frequently found in the mud near the ftiore,
overwhelmed in former times by the increafe of water.
This is fuppofed to be occafioned by the vaft quanti¬
ties of ftone and gravel that are continually brought
down by the mountain rivers, and by the falls of the
banks of the Leven ; the firft filling the bed of the
lake, the laft impeding its difcharge through the bed
of the river.”
LOMONOZOF, a celebrated Ruflian poet, the
great refiner of his native tongue, was the fon of a
dealer in fifti at Kolmogori : he was born in 1711, and
was fortunately taught to read 5 a rare circumftance
at that time for a perfon of his ftation in Ruflia. His
natural genius for poetry was firft kindled by the pe-
rufal of the Song of Solomon, done into verfe by Po-
lotlki, whofe rude compofitions, perhaps fcarcely fu-
perior to our verfion of the pfalms by Sternhold and
Hopkins, infpired him with fuch an irrefiftible paflion
for the mufes, that he fled from his father, who was
defifous of compelling him to marry, and took refuge
in the Kaikonofpalki monaftery at Mofcovv y there he
had
L O M
Lomonozof. had an opportunity of indulging his tafte for letters,
' y   and of ftudying the Greek and Latin languages. In
this feminary he made fo confiderable progrefs in po¬
lite literature, as to be noticed and employed by the
Imperial Academy of Sciences. In 1736 he was fent
at the expence of that fociety, to the univerfity of
Marpurg in Heffe Caffel, where he became a fcholar
of the celebrated Chriftian Wolf, under whom he ftudi-
ed univerfal grammar, rhetoric, and philofophy. He
continued at Marpurg four years, during which time
he applied himfelf with indefatigable diligence to che-
miftry, which he afterwards purfued with Hill greater
fuccefs under the famous Henckel at Frey berg in
Saxony. In 1741 he returned into Ruflia 5 was cho-
fen in 1742 adjunft to the Imperial Academy } and in
the enfuing year member of that fociety and profeflbr
of chemiftry. In 1760 he was appointed infpeftor of
the feminary then annexed to the academy ; in 1764
he was gratified by the late emprefs wdth the title of
counfellor of Hate } and died April 4th that year, in
the 54th year of his age. Lomonozof excelled in va¬
rious kinds of compofition : but his chief merit, by
which he bears the firft rank among the Ruffian writ¬
ers, is derived from his poetical compofitions, the
fineft of which are his odes. The firft wTas written in
1739, while he ftudied in Germany, upon the taking
of Kotfchin, a fortrefs in Grim Tartary, by Marffial
Munich. The odes of Lomonozof are greatly ad¬
mired for originality of invention, fublimity ot fenti-
ment, and energy of language *, and compenfate for the
turgid ftyle which, in fome inftances, has been im¬
puted to them, by that fpirit and fire which are the
principal charafteriftics in this fpecies of compofition.
Pindar was his great model •, and if wTe may give cre¬
dit to a perfon well verfed in the Ruffian tongue, he
has fucceeded in this daring attempt to imitate the
Theban bard, without incurring the cenfure of Ho¬
race. In this, as well as feveral other fpecies of com¬
pofition, he enriched his native language with various
kinds of metre, and feems to have merited the appel¬
lation beftowed upon him of the Father of Rujjian Poe¬
try. A brief recapitulation of the principal works of
Lomonozof, which were printed in three volumes oc¬
tavo, will ferve to ftiow the verfatility of his genius,
and his extenfive knowledge in various branches of li¬
terature. The firft volume, befides a Preface on the
advantages derived to the Ruffian tongue from the ec-
clefiaftical writings, contains ten facred and nineteen
panegyric odes, and feveral occafional pieces of poetry.

Befides thefe various fubjects, Lomonozof made no in-
confiderable figure in hiftory, having publilhed two
fmall works relative to that of his own country. The
firft, ftyled Annals of the Ruffian Sovereigns, is a fliort
chronology of the Ruffian monarchs •, and the fecond
is, the Ancient Hiffory of Ruflia, from the Origin of
that Nation to the Death of the Great Duke Yaro-
flaf I. in 1054 ; a performance of great merit, as it il-
luft rates the moft difficult and obfcure period in the
annals of this country.
LONDON, a large city of Middlefex in England,
the metropolis of Great Britain, and one of the moft
wealthy and populous cities in the world, is fituated
on the river Thames, in 51° 31' north latitude, 400
miles fouth of Edinburgh, and 270 fouth-eaft of Dub¬
lin j 180 miles weft of Amfterdam, 210 north-weft of
Paris, 500 fouth-weft of Copenhagen, 600 north-weft
of Vienna, 790 fouth-weft of Stockholm, 800 north-eaft
of Madrid, 820 north-weft of Rome, 850 north-eaft of
Lilbon, 1360 north-weft of Conftantinople, and 1414
fouth-weft of Mofcow. ,
This city w^as by the Romans firft called Londinium its different;
ox Lundinum, as we find it in Tacitus, Ptolemy, An-names,
toninus, and Ammianus. That name was afterwards
changed into Augufla ; in honour, as fome fay, of He¬
lena Augufta, the mother of Conftantine the Great ;
while others think it more probable that it had this
name from the fecond legion, whofe peculiar title was
Augufa; and fome imagine that the honourable ap¬
pellation of Augufa was conferred upon this city by
the Romans, as upon other principal cities of their em¬
pire, on account of its being grown up to be the ca¬
pital of their Britilh province. How long the name
of Augufa prevailed, is not now certainly known; but
after the eftabliffiment of the Saxons w'e find no more
mention of Augufta. It wras then called Caer Lun-
dain, Lundoun Bi/rig, Lunden Ceafer, Lunden-wyey
Lundenne, Lunden-berh or Lundenburg ; fince the con-
queft the records call it Londinia, Lundonia, Londine,
Londres; and, for feveral ages part, it has been call¬
ed London, a manifeft corruption from Tacitus’s Lon-
dinium. The moft probable derivation of thefe names
appears to be, either from the Britiftr words Ihong, “ a
Ihip,” and din, “ a town,” i. e. a town or harbour for
(hips } or from Lhn “ a lake,” i. e. Lhn din, “ the
town upon the lake,” the Surry fide being fuppofed,
upon very probable grounds, to have been anciently a
great expanfe of water.
Londinium, however, was not the primitive name of When
this famous place, which exifted before the invafion of Landed,
the Romans j being, at the time of Csefar’s arrival in
the ifland, the capital of the Trinobantes or Trinou-
antes. The name of this nation, as appears from Bax¬
ter’s Britifh Gloffary *, was derived from the three * p> ^
following Britifti words, tn, nou, hant, which fignify
the “ inhabitants of the new city.” This name, it is
fuppofed, ,

When ta¬
ken poffef-
iion of by
the Ro-
LON [ 1
fuppofed, might have been given them by their neigh¬
bours, on account of their having newly come from
the continent into Britain, and having there founded
a city called tri-now, or the “ new city 5” the mod an¬
cient name of the renowned metropolis of Britain. The
Trinobantes had come fo lately from Belgium, that
they feem fcarcely to have been firmly eifablilhed in
Britain at the time of the firft Roman invafion : For
their new city, which foon after became fo famous, was
then fo inconfiderable, that it is not mentioned by Cae-
far, though he mull have been within fight of the place
where it was fituated. His filence about this place, in¬
deed, is brought as a proof that he did not crofs the
1 hames 5 while Norden by the jirmijjima civitas of the
irinobantes underftands the city in queftion, the Tri¬
nobantes themfelves having been among the firft of the
Britilh ftates who fubmitted to that conqueror.
By Ptolemy, and fome other ancient writers of good
authority, indeed, Londinium is placed in Cantium,
or Cent, on the fouth fide of the Thames 5 and it is
the opinion of fome moderns, that the Romans pro¬
bably had a ftation there, to fecure their conquells on
that fide of the river, before they reduced the Trino¬
bantes. The place fixed upon for this ftation is St
George’s Fields, a large plat of ground fituated be¬
tween Lambeth and Southwark, wrhere many Roman
coins, bricks, and checquered pavements, have been
found. Three Roman ways from Kent, Surry, and
Middlefex, interfered each other in this place j this
therefore is fuppofed to be the original Londinium,
which it is thought became negledled after the Ro¬
mans reduced the Trinobantes, and fettled on the other
fide of the Thames; and the name w7as transferred to
the new city.
I he fituation of this city, as Mr Pennant obferves,
was juft fuch as the people would fele£l; according to
the rule eftablilhed among the Britons. An immenfe
foreft originally extended to the river fide, and even as
late as the reign of Henry II. covered the northern
neighbourhood of the city, and was filled wdth various
ipecies of beafts of chafe. It was defended naturally
by folfes ; one formed by the creek which run along
1 leet-ditch, the other afterwards known by that of
W allbrook j the fouth fide was guarded by the Thames;
the north they might think fufficiently protected by
the adjacent foreft.
I he Romans poffefled themfelves of London, on
their fecond invafion in the reign of Claudius, about
105 years after their firft under Caefar. They had be¬
gun with Camelodunum, the prefent Maldon in Effex;
and having taken it, planted there a colony confiding
of veterans of the 14th legion. London and Verulam
were next taken poffeflion of about one and the fame
time. Camelodunum w:as made a colonia or place go¬
verned entirely by Roman laws and cuftoms ; Verulam
(on the fite of which St Alban’s now Hands), a muni-
cipium, in which the natives wrere honouied w-ith the
privileges of Roman citizens, and enjoyed their own
laws and conftitutions ; and Londinium only a preefec-
tura, the inhabitants, a mixture of Romans and Britons,
being fuffered to enjoy no more than the name of citi¬
zens of Rome, being governed by praefedls fent annu¬
ally from thence, without having either their owm law^s
•or magiftrates. “ It was even then of fuch concourfe
(fays Mr Pennant), and fuch vaft trade, that the wife
74 ] LON
conquerors did not think fit to truft the inhabitants London,
with the fame privileges as other places of which they v*—^
had lefs reafon to be jealous.” But others obferve, that
this is a miftake; and that the Romans, in order to
fecure their conqueft, and to gain the affedions of thofe
Britons who had already fubmitted to their authority,
made London equally a municipium or free city with
Verulamium, as may be feen by referring to Aulus
Gellius, lib. xvi. c. 13. and to Spanhem. orbis Roman,
tom ij. p. 37, 38.
It is difficult to fay what w^ere the particular articles Anci™t
of commerce exported from and imported into the commerce
port of London at this period. The imports and ex-of London,
ports of the ifland in general wre know : Strabo lays,
“ Britain produceth corn, cattle, gold, filver, iron j
befides which, Ikins, flaves, and dogs, naturally excel¬
lent hunters, are exported from that iiland.” It is
probable that the two firft and three laft articles were
exported from London ; and perhaps, too, the gagates
or jet-ftone mentioned by Solinus as one of the pro-
duftions of Britain, together with horfes, were export¬
ed from thence. The imports were at firft fait, earthen
ware, and works in brafs, poliffied bits of bones emu¬
lating ivory, horfe collars, toys of amber, glaffes, and
other articles of the fame material.
In the reign of Nero, as Tacitus informs us, Lon¬
don was become a city highly famous for the great
conflux of merchants, her extenfive commerce, and
plenty of all things. No few'er than feven of the four¬
teen itinera of Antoninus begin or end at Lon¬
don ; which tends to corroborate the many proofs
which might be adduced, that this city was the capital
of Britain in the Roman times.
At firft London had no w^alls or other fortifications wTien fHt
to defend it, and was therefore expofed to the attacks furrounded
of every enemy : and thus it fuffered feverely about the with walls,
year 64, being burnt by the Britons under Boadicea,
and all the inhabitants maffacred. But it w!as foon
reftored by the Romans ; and increafed fo much, that
in the reign of the emperor Severus it is called by He-
rodian a great and wealthy city. It continued, however,
in a defencelefs ft ate for more than a century after this
laft period ; when at laft a w7all of hewn ftone and Bri-
tifti bricks wras erefted round it.
London at this time extended in length from Lud-
gate-hill to a fpot a little beyond the Tower. The
breadth was not half equal to the length, and at each
end grew confiderably narrower. Maitland aferibes
the building of the walls to Theodofius governor of
Britain in 369. Dr Woodward, with more probabi¬
lity, fuppofes them to have been founded under the
aufpices of Conftantine the Great ; and this feems to
be confirmed by the numbers of coins of that empe¬
ror’s mother Helena, which have been difeovered un¬
der them, placed there by him in compliment to her.
The fame emperor made it a biffiop’s fee ; for it ap¬
pears that the bilhops of London and York, and ano¬
ther Englilh bifhop, were at the council of Arles in the
year 314: he alfo fettled a mint in it, as is plain from 6
fome of his coins. The ancient courfe of the wrall Their an-
was as follows : It began with a fort near the prefent ^
fite of the Tower, was continued along the Minories, * ’
and the back of Houndfditch, acrofs Biihopfgate-
ftreet, in a ftraight line by London-wall to Cripple-
gate ; then returned fouthward
by Crowder’s Well
alley

alley (where feveral remnants of lofty towers wrere
> lately to be feen), to Alderfgate, thence along the
back of Bull-and-Mouth-llreet to Newgate, and again
along the back of the houfes in the Old Bailey to
Ludgate ; foon after which, it probably finifhed w*ith
another fort, where the houfe, late the king’s print¬
ing houfe, in Black Friars, now Hands : from hence
another wall ran near the river fide, along Thames-
ftreet, quite to the fort on the eaftern extremity. The
walls were three miles a hundred and fixty-five feet in
circumference, guarded at proper diftances on the land
fide wfith fifteen lofty towers j fome of them were re¬
maining within thefe few years, and poflibly may ftill.
Maitland mentions one twenty-fix feet high, near Gra¬
vel-lane, on the wTeft fide of Houndfditch j another,
about eighty paces fouth-eaft towards Aldgate •, and
the bafes of another, fupporting a modern houfe, at
the lower end of the ftreet called the Vinegar yard,
fouth of Aldgate. The walls, when perfect, are fup-
pofed to have been twenty-two feet high, the tow'ers
forty. Thefe, wfith the remnants of the wTall, proved
the Roman ftruflure, by the titles and difpofition of
the mafonry. London-wall, near Moorfields, is now
the moft entire part left of that ancient precinft. The
gates w'hich received the great military roads, were
four. The Praetorian way, the Saxon Watling-ftreet,
pailed under one, on the fite of the late Newgate j
veftiges having been difeovered of the road in digging
above Holburn-bridge : it turned down to Dowgate,
or more properly Dwr-gate or Water-gate, w’here
there was a trajeflus or ferry, to join it to the Wat¬
ling-ftreet, wTich was continued to Dover. The Her-
min-ftreet paffed under Cripplegate j and a vicinal wray
w’ent under Aldgate by Bethnal-green, towards Old-
ford, a pafs over the river Lee to Duroleiton, the
modern Leiton in Effex.
After the Romans deferred Britain, a new and fierce
e fucceeded. The Saxons, under their leaders
the Saxons. Hengift and Horfa, landed in 448, having been invit¬
ed over by the provincials as auxiliaries againft the
Scots and Pidfs ; but quarrelling with their friends,
they found means to eftablilh themfelves in the ifland,
and in procefs of time entirely fubdued them, as re¬
lated under the article England, N° 31—44. Lon¬
don fell into the hands of thofe invaders about the
year 457 5 and became the chief city of the Saxon
kingdom in Eftex. It fuffered much in the wars car¬
ried on between the Britons and Saxons: but it foon
recovered ; fo that Bede calls it a princely mart-town,
under the government of a chief magiftrate, whofe
title of portgf-ave, or portreve, (for we find him called
by both names), conveys a grand, idea of the mer¬
cantile ftate of London in thofe early ages, that re¬
quired a governor or guardian of the port. During
the civil wars of the Saxons with each other, the
Londoners had always the addrefs to keep themfelves
neuter *, and about the year 819, when all the feven
Saxon kingdoms fell under the pow7er of Egbert, Lon¬
don became the metropolis of England, which it has
ever fince continued.
During the invafions of the Danes, London fuffered
greatly. Ip 849, thefe invaders entered the Thames
with 2co {hips, plundered and burnt the city, and maf-
facred the inhabitants •, and two years after they re¬
turned with a fleet of 350 fail, fully determined to de-

pieces by King Ethelwolf and his fon Athelbald 5 yet
Juch was the deftruflion made by thofe barbarians at
London, that it fuffered more from thefe tw’O incur-
fions than ever it had done before. 9
In the reign of King Alfred the Great, London be-Recovers
gan to recover from its former ruinous ftate. He re-
built its walls, drove out the Danifh inhabitants w'ho Qreat,
had fettled there, reftored the city to its former liberties
and beauty, and committed the care of it to his fon-
in-lawr, Ethelred duke of Mercia, in hopes that this
might always be a place of fecure retreat within its
ftrong walls, whatever might happen from a foreign or
domeftic enemy. In 893, however, he had the mor- IO
tification to fee his capital totally reduced to afhes by Reduced
an accidental fire, which could not be extinguiflied, as to alhes.
the houfes at that time w7ere all built of wood. The
walls, however, being conftrufted of incombuftible ma¬
terials, continued to afford the fame protection as be¬
fore ; the houfes were quickly rebuilt, and the city di¬
vided into wards and precinCts, for its better order and
government. This king alfo inftituted the office of „
{heriff, the nature of which office made it neceffary tolls govern-
have it alfo in London ; fo that here we have the glim- ment fet-
merings of the order of magiftrates afterwards fettled tie^‘

Alfred having fettled the affairs of England in the Erick and
moft: prudent manner, direfted his attention to the or- (tone
namenting, as much as poftible, the city of London, houfes firft
For this purpofe, he fpirited up the Englilh. to an emu-ere<^e^‘
lation in building their houfes of ftronger and more
durable materials than formerly. At that time their
houfes were moftly of wood ; and an houfe built of
any other materials was looked upon as a kind of won¬
der. But Alfred having begun to raife his palaces of
ftone and brick, the opulent Londoners, and the no¬
bility refident in and about London, followed the ex¬
ample, though the cuftom did not come into general
ufe till fome ages after. ^
In 1015, a foreign enemy again appeared before Befieged by
London. Canute king of Denmark having invaded Canute,
and plundered the counties of Dorfet, Somerfet, and
Wilts, failed up the Thames w7ith 200 {hips, and laid
fiege to the city. The citizens continued faithful, nct-
withftanding the defedfion of the greateft part of the
kingdom ; and made fuch a brave refiftance, that Ca¬
nute thought fit to withdraw his army, leaving only
his fleet to blockade the city by water, that when he
found a fair opportunity he might renew the fiege with
better fuccefs. At laft, how7everj being defeated in
feveral battles by Edmund Ironfide, he was obliged
to call off his {hips to cover his own army in cafe of
neceffity. In the compromife, however, which was
afterwards made between Edmund and Canute, the city
of London w7as given to the latter, and owned him for
its lawful fovereign. We have a ftrong proof of the
opulence of London even at this time, from the tax laid

In 1046, we have the firft inftance of the London¬
ers fending reprefentatives to parliament. This hap¬
pened on fettling the fucceflion to the throne after Ca¬
nute’s death. The Englilh in general declared for Ed¬
ward fon of King Ethelred ; or, if that could not be
carried, for Hardicanute, fon of Canute by Queen
Emma, and then abfent on a tour to Denmark. The
city of London efpoufed the claim and intereft of Ha¬
rold Harefoot, fon alfo of Canute, by Queen Elgiva
of Northampton. Edward’s party foon declined *, and
the Londoners agreed, for the peace of the realm, that
the two brothers ftiould divide the kingdom between
them ; but as Hardicanute did not return in proper
time to England, a voittena-gemote rvas held at Ox¬
ford, where Earl Leofric, and moft of the thanes on
the north of the Thames, with the pilots of London,
chofe Harold for their king. Here, by pilots we are
to underftand the directors, magiftrates, or leading
men of the city : and this manifeftly (hows, that Lon¬
don was then of fuch confequence, that no important
national affair was tranfafled without the confent of
the inhabitants', for the Saxon annals affure us, that
none were admitted into this affembly of election but
the nobility and the pilots of London.
On the invafion of the Normans under William I.
London fubmitted as well as the reft of the kingdom $
and received two charters from that prince, confirm¬
ing all the privileges they had under the Saxon kings,
and adding feveral new ones. But w’hile the citizens
were promifing themfelves all manner of feeurity and
tranquillity under the new government, it was almoft
entirely reduced to allies by an accidental fire in 1077.
It had" fcarce recovered from this calamity, when it
was vilited by another of the fame kind in 1086, wdiich
began at Ludgate and deftroyed the belt and moft
opulent part of the city ', confuming, among other build¬
ings, the cathedral of St Paul’s j wdiich, however, was
foon rebuilt more magnificently than before. Under
the reign of William Rufus, London fuffered confider-
ably by fires, hurricanes, and inundations, and feems
to have been depreffed by the tyranny of that prince j
but Henry I. granted large immunities to the city,
which again revived its trade, and was favourable to
the progrefs of the arts. The king, howTever, ftill re¬
tained the privilege of appointing the portreve, or
chief magiftrate •, but the immunities granted to the
Londoners fecured their affe&ions, and tended much
to fecure him on the throne. At the fame time, there
was fuch a plenty of all kinds of provifions, that as
much corn w’as fold for is. as would fuffice 100 people
for a day j 4d. would purchafe as much hay and corn
as would maintain 20 horfes for a day \ and a fheep
could be bought for a groat.
Henry thought proper alfo to check the licentious
behaviour of the Normans, which, by the favour
{bowed them under the tw’O Williams, bad carried
them into the moft barbarous praftices. Thofe who
followed William Rufus in his excurfions, haraffed
and plundered the country at difcretion. Many of
them were fo extravagant in their barbarity, that what
they could not eat or drink in their quarters, they ei¬
ther obliged the people to carry to market and fell

for their ufe, or elfe they would throw it into the fire :
and, at their going off, they frequently waftied their ^
horfes heels with the drink, and ftaved the calks con¬
taining the remainder. King Henry refolved to put
a flop to thefe exceffes and favage cuftoms; and there¬
fore published a proclamation at London, commanding
that thenceforward all perfons who ftiould be convidled
of inch barbarities fttould have their eyes pulled out,
or their hands or feet cut off, as the minifters of juftice
fhould think fit. This effe&ually checked the info-
lence of the Normans, and the city continued to flou-
rilh throughout the reigns of Henry I. and Stephen.
The attachment of the citizens to Stephen, however,
was a crime which never could be forgiven by Henry II.
and, of confequence, he made them fenfible of his dif-
pleafure, by making frequent demands of money from
them. About this time, indeed, the Londoners were

arrived at fuch a pitch of licentioufnefs, that their pro-Londoners,
fperity feemed a curfe rather than a bleffmg. The
fons of the moft eminent and wealthy citizens entered
into a confederacy to commit burglaries, and to rob
and murder all that came in their way in the night¬
time. The king took an opportunity from thefe irre¬
gularities to enrich himfelf. He demanded feveral
loans and free gifts ; till at laft the Londoners,^ to
prevent further inquiries into their condufr, paid into
the exchequer 5000I. in three years, i hefe diiorders,
however, w’ere at laft flopped by the execution of John
Senex j who, though a very rich and reputable citizen,
had engaged in thele enterprifes. He offered 5001b.
weight of lilver, a prodigious fum in thofe days, for
his pardon, but was refufed. The king, however, ftill
continued to drain the citizens of their money by free
gifts} and at laft fined every feparate guild, fraternity,
or company, that had prefumed to a£l as bodies cor¬
porate without the royal letters-patent.
On the death of Henry II. the title of the firft ma¬
giftrate of London was changed from portgreve to that
of bailiff; and in 1189 claimed and afted in the office
of the chief butler at the coronation of Richard I. The office
1191 this monarch permitted the bailiff, named Henrymay0r
Fit%-Alwine, to affume the title of mayor. For, in when firft.
1192, we find certain orders of the mayor and alder- inftituted.
men to prevent fires 5 whereby it was ordained, that
“ all houfes thereafter to be ereaed in London and
the liberties thereof, fhould be built ot ftone, with
party-walls of the lame j and covered eitner with flates
or tiles, to prevent thofe dreadful calamities by fire,
which were frequently and chiefly occafioned by houfes
built of wTood, and thatched wuth draw or reeds.”
And for this purpofe, it was alfo provided by the dif-
creeter men of the city, “ that 12 aldermen of the
city flrould be chofen in full huttings, and there fvvorn
to affift the mayor in appeafing contentions that might
arife among neighbours in the city upon enclolure be¬
twixt land and land, and to regulate the dimenfions ©f
party-walls, which were to be of ftone, 16 feet high
and three feet thick } and to give direaions about
girders, windows, gutters, and wells.” Such confi¬
dence alfo did Richard put in the wifdom and faith-
fulnefs of the city of London, that when it was re¬
folved to fix a ftandard for weights and meafures for
the whole realm, his maiefty committed the execution
thereof to the ffieriffs of London and Middlefex, whom
he commanded to provide meafures, gallons, iron rods,

and weights, for ilandards, to be fent to the feveral
counties of England. This happened in 1198, at
which time corn was advanced to the enormous price
of 18s. 4d. per quarter.
The city of London was much favoured by King
John, who granted them three charters foon after his
acceflion. 'Fhe firft was a recital and confirmation of
thofe granted by Henry I. and II. with the farther
privilege oi being free from toll and every other duty
or cuftom in his majefty’s foreign dominions ; for
which they paid the fum of 3000 merks. The fecond
was a confirmation of one granted by King Richard.
By this the citizens of London had the jurifdidlion
and confervancy of the river Thames; with a claufe to
extend that jurifdidtion, and the powers therewith
granted, to the river Medway •, and with another
claufe to enable the faid city, as confervators of the
rivers Thames .and Medway, to infiidt a penalty of 10I.
upon any perfon that Ihould prefume to eredt a wear
in either of thefe rivers. The third charter contains
a fee-farm-rent of the fheriff’wicks of London and
Middlefex at the ancient rent, of which they had been
deprived by Queen Maud j granting them alfo the ad¬
ditional power of choofing their own fheriffs. This
charter w'as given by way of conveyance from the
crown to the citizens for a valuable confideration, by
which the fheriffwick became their freehold 5 and this
is the firft covenant or conveyance we find on record
with the legal terms of to have and to hold, which are
at this time accounted an effential part in all convey¬
ances of property.
During the reign of Henry III. the city of London
was opprefled in many different wrays. In 1218, he
exadfed a fine of 40 marks for felling a fort of cloth
not two yards within the lifts ; and a 15th of the citi¬
zens perfonal eftates for the enjoyment of their ancient
rights and privileges. In 1221, he commanded by
proclamation all the foreign merchants to depart the
city, which drew’ 30 marks from the Hanfeatic com¬
pany of the Steelyard, to have feifin of their guild or
hall in Thames-ftreet. But it wras the wreftling match
at St Giles’s in the fields that brought on their great-
eft burden. In the year 1221, on St James’s day,
the citizens of London having carried off the vidlory
from the people of Weftminfter and other neighbour¬
ing villages, the fteward of the abbot of Weftminfter,
meditating revenge againft the Londoners, propofed
another wuellling match with them, and gave a ram for
the prize. The citizens reforted to the place at the
time appointed ; but were unexpedledly affaulted by a
great number of armed men, who killed and wounded
many, and difperfed the reft. This raifed a great
commotion in the city. The populace breathed
revenge \ and, by the inftigation of Conftantine Fitz-
Arnulph, a great favourer of the French party during
the troubles in King John’s reign, they proceeded to
eftminfter, and pulled dowm the houfes both of the
ftew'ard and abbot. Hearing afterwards that the ab¬
bot was come into the city with his complaint to
I hilip d Aubney the king’s counfel, they purfued him,
beat his fervants cruelly, took away 1 2 of his horfes,
and would have murdered himfelf, had he not efcaped
by a back-door. Upon this tumult, Hubert de Bury,
then chief judiciary, fummoned the mayor and many of
the principal citizens to attend him in the tower of
Vox.. XII. Part I.

London ; and inquiring for the authors of the riot, London.
Conftantine, the ringleader boldly anfwered, that “ he
wras one j that they had done no more than they
ought ; and that they were refolved to avow what
they had done, let the confequence be what it would.”
In this he was feconded by his nephew and che Geof¬
frey : but the jufticiary, having difmifled all the reft,
detained thefe three, and ordered them to be hang¬
ed next morning, though Conftantine offered 15,000
marks for his pardon. *-Hubert then coming into the <
city with a ftrong guard, caufed the hands and feet of
moft of the principal rioters he could feize to be cut
off: all which was executed without any legal pro¬
ceedings or form of trial. After thefe arbitrary cruel¬
ties, he degraded the mayor and all the magiftrates;
placed a cujlos over the city, and obliged 30 perfons
of his own choofing to become fecurities for the good
behaviour 4 the whole city. Several thoufand marks
were alfo exadled by the king, before he would confent
to a reconciliation.
^ This arbitrary condudl alarmed the whole nation.
The parliament of 1224 began to be uneafy for them-
felves, and addrefled his majefty that he would be plea!-
ed to confirm the charter of liberties which he had
fworn to obferve ; and the confequence of this applica¬
tion was a confirmation of the magna charta in the full
parliament at Weftminfter in the year 1225. At this
time alfo, the rights and privileges of the citizens
w^ere confirmed. They were exempted from profecu-
tion for burels, i. e. lifted cloth ; and were granted the
right of having a common feal. The neceflitous cir-
cumftances of this monarch, however, made him often
exadl money arbitrarily as long as he lived.
Under the fucceeding reigns, as the liberty of the peo¬
ple in general, was augmented, fo the liberty, opulence,
and power of the citizens of London increafed, until they
became a kind of balance to the power of the crown
itfelf, which in fome meafure they ftill continue to be.
Riots indeed, for which they generally fuffered, were by
no means unfrequent ; the city often fuffered by fires
and plagues. Nothing, however, happened which ma¬
terially affedted the weliare of the city, till the reign of 21
Charles II. in 1665.—This year London was ravaged ^rea^u^
by the moft violent plague ever known in Britain. plaSue in
The whole fummer had been remarkably ftill and1655'
warm, fo that the weather was fometimes fuffocatihg
even to people in perfeft health ; and by this unufual
heat and fultry atmofphere, people were undoubtedly
prepared for receiving the infe&ion, which appeared
with violence in the months of July, Auguft, and
September. A violent plague had raged in Holland
m the year 1663 ; on which account the importation
of merchandife from that country wras prohibited by
the Britifti legiflature in 1644. Notwithftanding this
prohibition, however, it feems the plague had atfuallv
been imported •, for in the clofe of the year 1664, two
or three perfons died fuddenly in Weftminfter, wuth
marks of the plague on their bodies. Some of their
neighbours, terrified at the thoughts of their danger,
removed into the city 5 but their removal proved too
ate 01 themfelves, and fatal to thofe amon^ whom,
they came to refide. They foon died of the plague 5
and communicated the infection to fo many, others),
that it became impoftible to extinguifh the feeds of it,
by feparating thofe that were infeifted from fuch as

London, were not. It was confined, however, through a hard
frofty winter, till the middle of February, when it
again appeared in the parilh of St Giles’s, to which it
had been originally brought; and, after another long
reft till April, ftiowed its malignant force afrelh, as
foon as the warmth of the fpring gave it opportunity.
 At firft, it took off one here and there, without any
certain proof of their having infected each other, and
houfes began to be ftiut up, with a defign to prevent
•its fpreading. But it was now too late *, the infe&ion
gained ground every day, and the {hutting up of
houfes only made the difeafe fpread wider. People,
afraid of being ftiut up, and fequeftered from all commu¬
nication -with fociety, concealed their illnefs, or found
means to efcape from their places of confinement j
while numbers expired in the greateft torments, defti-
tute of every afliftance ; and many died both of the
plague and other difeafes, who would in all probabi¬
lity have recovered, had they been allowed their
liberty, with proper exercife and air.—A houfe was
fhut up on account of a maid-fervant, who had only
fpots, and not the gangrenous plague-blotches, upon
her, fo that her diftemper was probably a petechial
fever. She recovered 5 but the people of the houfe
obtained no liberty to ftir, either for air or exercife, for
40 days. The bad air, fear, anger, and vexation, atT
tending this injurious treatment, caft the miftrefs of
the family into a fever. The vifitors appointed to
fearch the houfe, faid it was the plague, though the
phyficians were of a different opinion : the family,
however, were obliged to begin their quarantine anew
though it had been almoft expired before ; and this
fecond confinement affefted them fo much, that moft
of the family fell fick, fome of one diftemper and fome
of another. Every illnefs that appeared in the family
produced a frefti prolongation of their confinement ;
till at laft the plague was a&ually brought in by fome
of thofe who came to inquire into the health of the
family, and almoft every perfon in the houfe died.—
Many examples of a fimilar kind happened, and this
was one of the worft confluences of flmtting up
houfes. All means of putting a ftop to the infe&ion
were evidently ineffeflual. Multitudes fled into the
country ; many merchants, owners of {hips, &c. fhut
themfelves up, on board their veffels, being fupplied
■with provifions from Greenwich, Woolwich, and lingle
farm houfes on the Kentiftr fide. Here, however,
they were fafe •, for the infeftion never reached below
Deptford, though the people went frequently on Ihore
to the country towns, villages, and farm houfes, to
buy freflh provifions. As the violence of the plague
increafed, the fhips which had families on board re¬
moved farther off; fome went quite out to fea, and
then put into fuch harbours and roads as they could
beft get at.
In the mean time, the diftemper made the moft ra¬
pid advances within the city. In the laft week of
July, the number of burials amounted to 2010 ; but
the firft week of Auguft it rote to 3817 ; thence to
3880 ; then to 4237 ; the next week, to 6102 ; and at
laft to 7000 and 8000 weekly. In the laft week of
September, however, the fury of the difeafe began
abate; though vaft numbers were fick, yet the
number of burials decreafed from 7155 to 5538 ; the
ne^t week there was a farther decreafe to 4920, then
to 4327, next to 2665, then to 1421, and the next ^ London. ,
week to 103 t. v
All this while, the poor people had been reduced
to the greateft; diftreffes, by reafon of the ftagnation
of trade, and the fickneffes to which they w'ere pe¬
culiarly liable on account of their manner of living.
The rich, however, contributed to their fubfiftence in
a moft liberal manner. The fums collected on this
occafion are indeed almoft incredible ; being faid to
amount to loo,oool. per week. The king is report¬
ed to have contributed 1000I. weekly ; and in the pa-
rifti of Cripplegate alone, 17,000!. was diftributed
weekly among the poor inhabitants.—By the vigilance
alfo of the magiftrates, provifions continued remark¬
ably cheap throughout the whole time of this dreadful
calamity, fo that all riots and tumults on that account
were prevented ; and at laft, on the ceftation of the
difeafe in the winter of 1665, the inhabitants who had
fled returned to their habitations, and London to ap¬
pearance became as populous as ever, though it vras
computed that 100,000 perfons had been carried off
by the plague.
The city was fcarcely recovered from the defolation Account of
occafioned by the plague, when it was almoft: totally ft16 Sreat
laid in aftres by a moft dreadful fire. This broke out
in a baker’s ftiop in Pudding-lane, on Saturday night,
September 2. 1666. In a few hours Billingfgate ward
was entirely burnt down ; and before morning the fire
had crofted Thames-ftreet, and deftroyed the church of
St Magnus. From thence it proceeded to the bridge,
and confirmed a great pile of buildings there ; but
was flopped by the want of any thing more to de-
ftroy. The flames, however, being fcattered by a
ftrong eaft wind, continued their devaftations in other
quarters. All efforts to ftop it proved unfuccefsful
throughout the Sunday. That day it proceeded up as
far as Garlick-hithe ; and deftroying Canon-ftreet, in¬
vaded Cornhill and the Exchange. On Monday, the
flames having proceeded eaftward againft the wind
through Thames-ftreet, invaded Tower-ftreet, Grace-
church-ftreet, Fenchurch-ftreet, Dowgate, Old Fifh-
ftreet, Watling-ftreet, Threadneedle-ftreet, and feveral
others, from all which it broke at once into Cheapfide.
In a few hours Cheapfide was all in flames, the fire
having reached it from fo many places at once. The
fire then continuing its courle from the river on one
fide, and from Cbeapfide on the other, furrounded the
cathedral of St Paul’s. This building flood by itfelf
at fome diftance from any houfes; yet fuch wras the
violence of the flames, and the heat of the atmofphere
occafioned by them, that the cathedral took fire at
top. The great beams and maffy ftor.es broke through
into Faith-church underneath, which was quickly let
on fire ; after which, the flames invaded Pater-nofter-
row, Newgate-ftreet, the Old Bailey, Ludgate-hill,
Fleet-ftree*, Ironmonger-lane, Old-Jewry, Laurence-
lane, Milk-ftreet, Wood-ftreet, Gutter-lane, Fofter-
lane, Lothbury, Cateaton-ftreet; and, having deftroy¬
ed Chrift-church, burnt furioufly through St Martin’s
le Grand towards Alderfgate.
The fire had now attained its greateft: extent, and
was feveral miles in compafs. The vaft clouds of finoke
obfeured the fun fo, that he either could not be feen
at all, or appeared through it as red as blood. The
flames reached an immenfe w’ay up into the air, and
LON [ i
London, their refle&ion from the fmoke, which in the night-
“■'V—time feemed alfo like flame, made the appearance ftill
more terrible. The atmofphere was illuminated to a
great extent, and this illumination is laid to have been
vifible as far as Jedburgh in Scotland. Some of the
light allies alio are faid to have been carried to the
diltance of 16 miles. Guildhall exhibited a Angular
appearance. The oak with which it was built wras
fo iblid that it would not flame, but burnt like char¬
coal, fo that the building appeared for feveral hours
like an enchanted palace of gold or burnilhed brafs.
At laft, on Wednefday morning, w'hen every one
expefted that the luburbs as well as the city were to
have been burnt, the fire began of itfelf to abate by
reafon of the wind having ceafed, and fome other
changes no doubt taken place in the atmofphere. It
was checked by the great building in Leadenhall-
ftreet, and in other ftreets by the blowing up feveral
houfes with gun-powder ; and on Thurfday the flames
were quite extinguilhed.—The following is a calcula¬

It was never certainly known whether this fire was
accidental or defigned. A fufpicion fell upon the Pa-
pifls 5 and this gained fuch general credit, that it is af-
ferted for a truth on the monument which is ere&ed
in memory of the conflagration. Of the truth of this
aflertion, however, though there was not fufficient
proof, it had the effeft of making the Papifts moft
violently fufpefted and abhorred by the Proteftants,
which fome time after proved very prejudicial to the
city itfelf.

From this calamity, great as it was, London foon
recovered itfelf, and became much more magnificent
than before j the ftreets, which were formerly crooked
and narrow, being now' built wide and Ipacious j and
the induftry of its inhabitants repaired the Ioffes they
had fuftained. In 1679, the city was again alarmed
by the difcovery of a defign to deftroy it by fire a fe-
cond time. Elizabeth Oxly, fervant to one Rind in
Fetter-lane, having fet her mailer’s houfe on fire, was a defign
apprehended on fufpicion, and confeffed, that Ihe hadtofetit
been hired to do it by one Stubbs a Papift, for a re-on fire
wrard of 5I. Stubbs being taken into cuftody, ac-aSain‘
knovvledged that he had perfuaded her to it j and
that he himfelf had been prevailed upon by one Father
Gifford his confeffor, who had affured him, that by
burning the houfes of heretics he would do a great fer-
vice to the church. He alfo owned that he had feveral
conferences with Gifford and two Irithmen on the affair.
The maid and Stubbs alfo agreed in declaring, that the
Papifts intended to rife in London, expecting to be
powerfully fupported by a French army. In confe-
quence of this difcovery, the Papifts rvere banilhed from
the city, and five miles round, and five Jefuits were
hanged for the above-mentioned plot.
The Papifts thought to revenge themfelves by forg¬
ing what was called the meal-tub plot, in which the
Prelhyterians were fuppofed to hatch treacherous de- 2.
figns againft the life of the king. Sir Edmondbury Which
Godfrey alfo, who had been very adtive in his pro-gives °cca-
ceedings againfl: the Papifts, was murdered by fomellon tc’,a
unknown perfons j and this murder, together with tjie
their difcovering the fahehood of the meal-tub plot, court,
fo exafperated the Londoners, that they refolved to
(how their deteftation of Popery, by an extraordinary
exhibition on the 17th of November, Queen Eliza¬
beth’s acceffion to the throne, on which day they had
ufually burnt the pope in effigy. The proceffion be¬
gan with a perfon on horfeback perfonating Sir Ed¬
mondbury Godfrey, attended by a bellman proclaim¬
ing his execrable murder. He was followed by a per¬
fon carrying a large filver crofs, with priefts in copes,
Carmelites, and Gray-friars, followed by fix Jefuits :
then proceeded divers waiters, and after them fome
bilhops with lawn fleeves, and others with copes and
mitres. Six cardinals preceded the pope, enthroned in
a ftately pageant, attended by divers boys with pots of
incenfe, and the devil whifpering in his ear. In this
order they marched from Biffiopfgate to Fleet-ftreet ;
and there, amidft a great multitude of fpeftators, com¬
mitted his holinefs to the flames.
This proceffion gave great offence to the court, at
which the duke of York, afterwards James II. had a
great influence. The breach was farther widened by
the choice of Iheriffs for that year. The candidates
fet up by the court were reje£led by a majority of al-
moft two to one •, but this did not deter their party
from demanding a poll in their behalf, upon which a
tumult enfued. This was reprefented by the Popilh
party in fuch colours to the king, that he iffued out a
commiffion that fame evening for trying the rioters}
which, however, was fo far from intimidating the reft,
that they grew more and more determined, not only
to oppofe the Popilh party, but to exclude the duke
of York from his fucceflion to the crown*

In the mean time, the king prorogued the parlia¬
ment, to prevent them from proceeding in their in¬
quiry concerning the Popifh plot, and the exclufion-
bill. Upon this the lord-mayor, aldermen, and com¬
mon-council, prefented a petition to his majefty, in
which they requefted, that he would permit the
parliament to fit in order to complete their falutary
meafures and councils. This petition was highly re¬
lented by the king ; who, inftead of granting it, dif-
iblved the parliament, and could never afterwards be
reconciled to the city. From this time it wras deter¬
mined to feize their charter ; and frefh provocations
having been given about the elehtion of Iheriffs, a quo
warranto was at laft produced by the attorney-gene¬
ral, in order to overthrow their charter, and thereby
to deprive the citizens of the power to choofe ftreriffs.
This information fet forth, That “ the mayor and
commonalty and citizens of the city of London, by

warrant or legal grant, within the city of London
aforefaid, and the liberties and privileges of the fame

et com. Middlefex, and to name, make, and elehf, and

feffions of the peace. All which liberties, privileges,
and franchifes, the faid mayor and commonalty, and
citizens of London, upon the king did by the fpace
aforefaid ufurp, and yet do ufurp.”
Though nothing could be more unjuft: than this
profecution, the miniftry w'ere determined at all events
to crulh the Londoners •, rightly judging, that it would
be an eafy matter to make all other corporations
furrender their charters into the king’s hands, and
that they had no other body in the nation to fear.
Accordingly they difplaced fuch judges as would not
approve of their proceedings j and, on the 12th of
dune 1683, Juftice Jones pronounced the following
fentence : “ That a city might forfeit its charter 5
that the malverfations of the common council were
adds of the whole city ; and that the points fet forth
in the pleadings were juft grounds for the forfeiting of
a charter.”
Notwithftanding this fentence, however, the attor-
ney-general, contrary to the ufual cuftom in fuch cafes,
was direfled to move that the judgement might not be
recorded : being atraid of the confequences. Yet it
was judged that the king might feize the liberties of
the city. A common-council w7as immediately fum-
moned to deliberate on this exigency. The country
party moved to have the judgement entered j but they
w7ere overruled by the court party, w'ho infilled upon
an ahfolute fubmiftion to the king before judgement
w’as entered ; and though this was in efteht a voluntary
furrender of the city-liberties, and deprived them¬
felves of the means.of getting the judgement reverfed,
the a£l of fuLmiflion was carried by a great majority :
and in a petition from the lord mayor, aldermen, and
common-council, they “ acknowledged their own mif-
government, .and his majefty’s lenity ; begged his. par-
o ] LON
don, and promifed conftant loyalty and obed’ence ; and London,
humbly begged his majelly’s commands and direhlions.” " v
To this his majefty aniwered, that he would not reject 27
their fuit, if they would agree upon the following par- Conditions
ticulars. 1. That no lord mayor, fheriff, recorder, rec01?c^'
common lerjeant, town clerk, or coroner, or the city
London, or itew'ard of the borough of Southwark, king and
(hall be capable of, or admitted to, the exercife of their chy.
refpeflive offices before his maiefty ffiall have appro¬
ved of them under his fign-manual. 2. That if his
majefty ffiall difapprove the choice of any perfon to be
lord mayor, and fignify the fame under his fign-manual
to the lord mayor, or in default of a lord mayor, to the
recorder or fenior alderman, the citizens fhall, within
one week, proceed to a new choice : and if his majefty
ftiall in like manner difapprove the fecond choice, his
majefty may, if he pleafes, nominate a perfon to be lord
mayor for the year enfuing. 3. If his majefty (hall, in
like manner, difapprove the perfons chofen to be ftieriffs,
or either of them, his majefty may appoint (herifts for
the year enfuing. 4. That the lord mayor and court
of aldermen may, with the leave of his majefty, difplace
any alderman, recorder, &c. 5. Upon the eleflion of
an alderman, if the court of aldermen ftiall judge and
declare the perfon prefented to be unfit, the ward fhall
choofe again j and upon a difapproval of a fecond
choice, the court .may appoint another in his room.
6. That the juftices of the peace fliould be by the
king’s commiffion ; and the fettling of thofe matters to
be left to his majefty’s attorney-general and counfel
learned in the law.”
To thefe the lord-keeper added, in the king’s name,
“ That thefe regulations being made, his majefty would
not only pardon this profecution, but would confirm
their charter in fuch a manner as ftiould be confident
wdth them ; concluding thus: “ My lord mayor, the
term draws towards an end, and Midfummer-day is at
hand, when fome of the officers ufed to be chofen ;
wffiereof his majefty will referve the approbation. There¬
fore, it is his majefty’s pleafure, that you return to the
city, and confult the common-council, that he may
fpeedily know your refolutions thereupon, and accord-
ingly give his directions. That you may fee the king
is in eameft, and the mattet is not capable of delay, I
am commanded to let you know he hath given oiders
to his attorney-general to enter upon judgement on Sa¬
turday next unlefs you prevent it by your compliance
in all thefe particulars.”
A common-council was fummoned, when the friends
of liberty treated thofe flavilh conditions as they de-
ferved $ and even declared, that they wrere ready to fa-
crifice all that w’as near or dear to them, rather than
fubmit to fuch. arbitrary impofitions : but when it was
put to the vote, there appeared a majority of 18 for
fubmiffion.
Thus the king got the government of the city into
his own hands, though he and his brothers entirely loft c
the affeClions of the Londoners. But, not content with kjnw
their fubmiffion, his majefly departed from his promife ; breaks his

In this fubjedli®n to the will of the court, the city
of London continued till the Revolution ; but, in 1689,
the immediate reftoration of the Londoners to their
franchifes was ordered j and in fuch a manner and form,
as to put it out of the powers of an arbitrary minillry
and a corrupt judge and jury to deprive them of their
chartered liberties for the time to come. Accordingly
a bill was brought into parliament, and palled, for re-
verfing the judgement of the quo xvarranto againft the
city of London, and for relloring the fame to its ancient
rights and privileges. Since that time the city of Lon¬

Divifion in¬
to wards.
That part of this immenfe capital which is diftin-
guithed by the name of The City, Hands on the north
Ihore of the river, from the Tower to the Temple, oc¬
cupying only that fpace formerly encompaffed by the
wall, which in circumference meafures but three miles
and 165 feet. In this wall there were feven gates by
land, viz. Ludgate, Aldgate, Cripplegate, Alderfgate,
Moorgate, Bifhopfgate, which were all taken down
in September 1760 j and Newgate, the county gaol,
which was alfo taken down in 1776, and a malfive
building eredled a little Couth of it, which by the riot¬
ers in 1780 received damage to the amount of 83,000!.
On the lide of the water there were Dowgate and
Billingfgate, long fince demolilhed, as w’ell as the
poftern-gate near the Tower. In the year 1670 there
was a gate erefted called Temple-Bar, which termi¬
nates the bounds of the city weftward. The liberties,
or thofe parts of this great city which are fubjefl to
its jurjfdiftion, and lie without the walls of London,
are bounded on the eaft, in Whitechapel, the Mino-
ries, and Biihoplgate, by bars, which were formerly
polls and chains, that were frequently taken away by
arbitrary power, when it was thought proper to feize
the franchifes of the city of London : on the north,
they are bounded in the fame manner in Pickaxe-
Hreet, at the end of Fan-alley, and in St John’s-llreet :
on the weft, by bars in Holborn : at the eaft end of
Middle Row, and at the -weft end of Fleet-ftreet, by
the gate called Temple-Bar, already mentioned : on the
fouth, we may include the jurifdidlion which the city
holds on the river Thames, and over the borough of
South w’ark.
The city, including the borough, is at prefent divid¬
ed into 26 w-ards.
1. Atderfgate ward takes its name from .a city-gate
which lately Hood in the neighbourhood. It is bound¬
ed on the eaft by Cripplegate ward ; on the weft, by
Farringdon ward within and without and on the
fouth, by Farringdon w7ard within. It is very large,
and is divided into Alderfgate-within and Alderfgate-
with-out. Each of thefe divifions confifts of four pre-
cinfls, under one alderman, eight common-council men,
of whom two are the alderman’s deputies, eight con-
ftables, fourteen inqueflt-men, eight fcavengers, and a
beadle j exclufive of the officers belonging to the li-
1 ] LON
berty of St Martin’s le Grand, which contains 168
houfes.
2. Aldgate takes its name alfo from a gate, which
wqs of great antiquity, being mentioned in King Ed¬
gar’s charter to the knights of the Knighton Guild
about the year 967 j and was probably of a much
more ancient foundation, for it wras the gate through
w’hich the Roman vicinal w’ay lay to the ferry at Oid-
ford. In the time of the wars betwixt King John
and his barons, the latter entered the city through this
gate, and committed great devaftations among the
houfes of the religious. Aldgate w’as rebuilt by the
leaders of the party after the Roman manner. They
made ufe of ftone which they brought from Caen, and
a fmall brick called the Flanders tile, which Mr Pen¬
nant thinks has been often miftaken for Roman. I he
new gate wras very ftrong, and had a deep well within
it. In 1471 this gate was affaulted by the Baftard of
Falconbridge, who got poffelhon of it lor a few hours j
but the portcullis being drawn up, the troops which
had entered were all cut oft, and the citizens, headed
by the alderman of the ward and recorder, having
made a fally, defeated the remainder with great (laugh¬
ter. In 1606 Aldgate was taken down and rebuilt;
and many Roman coins were found in digging the
foundations.—The wTard of Aldgate is bounded on _
the eaft by the city wall, which divides it from Port-
foken ward ; on the north, by Bilhopfgate ward ; on
the weft, by Lime-ftreet and Langbourn wards 5 and
on the fouth, by Tower-ftreet ward. It is governed by
an alderman, fix common-council men, fix conftables,
twenty inqueft-men, feven fcavengers, and a beadle 5
befides the officers belonging to St James’s, Duke’s
Place.—It is divided into feven precinfls.
3. BaJJiJhaw or Bafnghall ward, is bounded on the
eaft; and fouth by Coleman-llreet ward, on the north
by part of Cripplegate, and one the weft by part of
the wards of Cheap and Cripplegate. On the fouth,
it begins at Black well-hall ) and runs northward to
London-wall, pulled dowm fome time ago to make
wray for new buildings in §Fore-Jlreet, and fpreads 88
feet eaft, and 54 feet weft againft the place where that
wrall flood. This is a very fmall ward, and confifts
only of two precindls : the upper precinfl contains no
more than 66, and the lower only 76 houfes. It is
governed by an alderman, four common-council men,
of whom one is the alderman’s deputy, three con¬
ftables, feventeen inqueft-men, three fcavengers, and
a beadle. It has its name from Bafinghall, the man-
fion-houfe of the family of Bajings, which was the
principal houfe in it, and flood in the place of Black-
well-hall.
4. Billingfgate ward is bounded on the eaft by
Tower-ftreet ward ; on the north, by Langbourn
ward j on the weft, by the ward of Bridge-within j
and on the fouth, by the river Thames. There have
been many conjeflures concerning the origin of the
name of Billingfgate, none of which feems to be very
w7ell authenticated. It is, for inftance, fuppofed to
have derived its name from a Britifti king named Beh-
nus, faid to have been ah affftlant of Brennus king of
the Gauls at th? taking of Rome, and is the fame with
the Beli-Maur mentioned in the Welfh genealogies..
The name of Ludgate is faid to be derived from his Ion
London.
LON [i
T.oncLn. LuJ.—It is divided into I 2 precin&s ; and is governed
by an alderman, 10 common-council men, one of whom
is the alderman’s deputy, il conftables, 14 inqueft-men,
fix fcavengers, and a beadle. The fituation of Billingf-
gate, on the river, gives it great advantages with re-
fpecl to trade and merchandife *, fo that it is well in¬
habited, and is in a continual hurry of bufmefs at the fe-
veral wharfs or quays.
5. Bijhopfgate ward is bounded on the eaft by Aid-
gate ward, Portfoken ward, and part of the Tower-
liberty, or Norton-falgate } on the weft, by Broad-ftreet
ward and Moornelds ; and on the fouth, by Langbourn
ward. It is very large, and divided into Bifhopfgate-
within and Bifhopfgate-without. The firft contains all
that part of the ward within the city-wall and gate,
and is divided into five precimfts j the fecond lies
without the wall, and is divided into four precindfts.
Biftiopfgate-without extends to Shoreditch, taking its
name from one Sir John de Sordich, an eminent law¬
yer much in favour with King Edward III. both on
account of his knowledge in the law, and of his
perfonal valour. In the time of Henry VIII. one
Barlo, a citizen and inhabitant of this place, was
named duke of Shoreditch, on account of his fkill in
archery 5 and, for a number of years after, the title
belonged to the captain of the London archers. This
ward is governed by an alderman, two deputies, one
within and the other without, 1 2 common-council men,
feven conftables, 13 inqueft-men, nine fcavengers, and
two beadles. It took its name from the gate, wdiich
has been pulled down to make that part of the city
more airy and commodious. This gate was built by
Erkemvald bifhop of London in 675 j and it is faid
to have been repaired by William the Conqueror foon
after the Norman conqueft. In the time of Henry III.
the Hanfe merchants had certain privileges confirmed
to them, in return for which they were to fupport this
gate $ and in confequence of this they rebuilt it ele¬
gantly in 1479. There were two ftatues of biihops, in
in memory of the founder and firft repairer ; other twTo
were alfo put up, which are fuppofed to have been de-
figned for Alfred and ALldred earl of Mercia to whofe
care the gate had been committed.

whom one is the alderman’s deputy, 13 conftables, 13
inqueft-men, 13 fcavengers, and a beadle j and yet
contains no more than 331 houfes. It takes its name
from the ancient bread-market, rvhich was kept in the
place now called Bread-Jlreet; the bakers being obliged
to fell their bread only in the open market and not in
ihops.
7. Bridge-ward within is bounded on the fouth by
the river Thames and Southwark 5 on the north, by

of 1666, was accounted one of the broadelc ftreets in
London.
9. Candlewick ward, Candlewick-JIreet, or Candle^
wright-Jlreet ward as it is called in fome ancient re¬
cords, is bounded on the eaft by Bridge ward ; on the
fouth, by Dowgate and part of Bridge ward ; on the

deputy, feven conftables, 13 inqueft-men, feven fca¬
vengers, and a beadle. It has its name from a ftreet,
formerly inhabited chiefty by candle wrights or candle-
bakers, both in tallow and wax : a very profitable bu-
finefs in the times of Popery, when incredible quanti¬
ties of wax candles were confumed in the churches.
That ftreet, however, or at leaft its name, Candlewick,

thority.

wras for fome time a guild j and had its beginning in
King Edgar, when 13 knights, “ well beloved of the
king and realm, for fervices by them done,” requefted
to have a certain portion of land on the eaft part of the
city left defolate and forfaken of the inhabitants by
reafon of too much fervitude. They befought the king
to have this land, with the liberty of a guild for ever. .
The king granted their requeft on the following condi¬
tions, viz. that each of them (hould vidlorioufly accom-
plifh three combats, one above the ground, one under
ground, and the third in the water : and after this, at
a certain day, in Eaft Smithfield, tl ey ftiould run with
fpears againft all comers. All this was glorioufly per¬
formed ; upon which the king named it Knighten
Guild, and extended it from Aldgate to the places
where the bars now are on the call, and to the Thames
on the fouth, and as far into the water as an horfeman
could ride at low water and throw his fpear.

mon-council men, one of whom is the alderman’s depu¬
ty, and nine conftables. It has its name from the hit he,
or harbour for large boats, barges, and lighters ; for
which, and even for fhips, it was the anchoring place,
and the quay for loading and unloading veffels almoft of
any burden ufed in ancient times. It has the name of
queen, becaufe the queens of England ufually pofTeffed
the tolls and cuifoms of vefiels that unloaded goods at

alderman, eight common-council men, of whom one
is the alderman’s deputy, feven conftables, 13 inqueft-

from the rivulet Wall-brook, that ran down the ftreet
of this name into the river Thames near Dowgate ;
but in procefs of time it was fo loft by covering it
with bridges, and buildings upon thofe bridges, that
its channel became a common fewer.
26. The wrard of Bridge-without includes the borough
of Southwark, and the pariftres of Rotherhithe, Newing¬
ton, and Lambeth. It has its name from London
bridge, with the addition of the word without, becaufe

minjler is generally reckoned a part of London, though
under a diftindl government j and has long been famous
for the palaces of our kings, the feat of our law wri-
bunals, and of the high court of parliament j all which

Govern- 1 be city and liberties of London are under an eccle-

London. ^s to its ecclejiajlical government, London is a bi-
ErrleiLfti- ^0P’S ^ee> ^ diocefe of which comprehends not only
cal. Middlefex, EiTex, and part of Hertfordftiire, but the
Britifti plantations in America. The bifhop of Lon¬
don takes precedency next to the archbilhops of Can¬
terbury and York j but the following parilhes of this
I
city are exempt from his jurifdidlion, being peculiars London.
under the immediate government of the archbiihop of' v—
Canterbury ; viz. All-hallows in Bread-ftreet, All-
hailows, Lombard-ftreet j St Dionys Back-church,
St Dunftan in the Eaft, St John Baptift, St Leonard
Eaftcheap, St Mary Aldermary, St Mary Bothaw,
St Mary le Bow, St Michael Crooked-lane, St Mi¬
chael Royal, St Pancras Soper-lane, and St Vedaft
Fofter-lane.
The civil government of London divides it into wards .. 34
and precindls, under a lord mayor, aldermen, and com-CmL
mon-council.
The mayor, or lord mayor, is the fupreme rc>agi-Lorci35
ftrate, chofen annually by the citizens, purfuant to a Mayor,
charter of King John. The prefent manner of elecl-
ing a lord mayor is by the liverymen of the feveral
companies, aflembled in Guildhall annually on Michael-
mas-day, according to an aft of common council in
A. D. 1476, where, and when, the liverymen choofe,
or rather nominate, two aldermen below the chair,
who have ferved the office of 11161-111, to be returned to
the court of aldermen, who may choofe either of the
two 5 but generally declare the fenior of the two, fo
returned, to be lord mayor cleft. The eleftion be¬
ing over, the lord mayor eleft, accompanied by the
recorder and divers aldermen, is foon after prefented to
the lord chancellor (as his majefty’s reprefentative in
the city of London) for his approbation ; and on the
9th of November following is fworn into the office of
mayor at Guildhall ; and on the day after, before the
barons of the exchequer at Weft min fter ; the pro-
ceffion on which occafion is exceedingly grand and
magnificent.
i'he lord mayor fits every morning at the manfion-
houfe, or place where he keeps his mayoralty, to de¬
termine any difference that may happen among the
citizens, and to do other bufinefs incident to the office
of a chief magiftrate. Once in fix weeks, or eight
times in the year, he fits as chief judge of oyer and
terminer, or gaol-delivery of Newgate for London
and the county of Middlefex. His jurifdiftion ex¬
tends all over the city and fuburbs, except fome places
that are exempt. It extends alfo from Colneyditch,
above Staines-bridge in the weft, to Yeudale, or
Yenflete, and the mouth of the river Medway, and up
that river to Upnor-caftle, in the eaft : by which he
exercifes the power of punifhing or correfting all
perfons that ftiall annoy the ftreams, banks, or filh.
For wThich purpofe his lordlhip holds feveral courts of
confervancy in the counties adjacent to the faid river,
for its confervation, and for the punifliment of offend¬
ers. See the article MAYOR’s-dWr/.
The title of dignity, alderjnan, is of Saxon original,
and of the greateft honour, anfwering to that of earl j A^eimeB’
though now it is nowhere to be fisund but in charter¬
ed focieties. And from hence we may account for the
reafon why the aldermen and commonalty of London
were called barons after the conqueft. Thefe magi-
ftrates are properly the fubordinate governors of their
refpeftive wards under the lord mayor’s jurifdiftion j
and they originally held their aldermanries either by
inheritance or purchafe ; at which time the alderman¬
ries or wards changed their names as often as their
governors or aldermen. The oppreftions, to which the
citizens were fubjeft from finch a government, put them
upon
LON [ 185 ] LON
London, upon means to abolifli the perpetuity of that office and
they brought it to an adtual election. But that man¬
ner of deffion being attended with many inconvenien¬
ces, and becoming a continual bone of contention
among the citizens, the parliament, 17 Richard II.
A. I). 1394, enabled, that the aldermen of London
fliould continue, in their fevernl offices during life or
good behaviour. And fo it ftiil continues : though
the manner of ele&ing has feveral times varied. At
prefent it is regulated by an a£t of parliament, palled
m the year 1724-5 : and the perfon fo ele&ed is to be
returned by the lord mayor (or other returning officer
in Ins dead, duly qualified to hold a court of wardmote)
to the court of lord mayor and aldermen, by whom the
perfon fo returned muft be admitted and fworn into the
office of alderman before he can aft. If the perfon
chofen refuleth to lerve the office of alderman, he is
finable 500I.
_ Thefe high officers conflitute a fecond part of the
city legifiature when aiiembled in a corporate capacity,
and exfcrcife an executive power in their refpeftive wards.
The aldermen who have palled the chair, or ferved the
high office of lord mayor, are juftices of the quorum 5
and all the other aldermen are not only juftices of the
peace, but by the llatute of 43 Eliz. entitled, A1//
for relief of the poor, “ every alderman of the city
of London, within his ward, lhall and may do and
execute, in every refpeft, fo much as is appointed and
allowed by the faid aft to be done or executed by one
or tiMo juftices of peace of any county within this
realm.” They every one keep their wardmote, or
court, for choofing ward officers and fettling the affairs
of the ward, to redrefs grievances, and to prefent all
17 defaults found within their refpeftive wards.
Common- . The next branch of the legifiative power in this
cour.cn. clty is the common-council. The many inconveniences
that attended popular affemblies, which were called
fo lit mote, determined the commonalty of London to
choofe reprefentatives to aft in their name and for
their intereft, with the lord mayor and aldermen, in all
affairs relating to the city. At firft thefe reprefenta¬
tives were chofen out of the feveral companies : but
that not being found fatisfaftory, nor properly the re-
preffintatives of the whole body of the inhabitants, it
was agreed to choofe a certain number of difereet men
out of each ward : which number lias from time to
time increafed according to the dimenfions cf each
ward.: and at pi'efent the 25 wards, into which Lon¬
don is divided, being fubdivided into 236 precinfts,
each precinft fends a reprefentative to the common-
council, who are elefted after the fame manner as an
alderman, only with this difference, that as the lord
mayor prefides in the wardmote, and is judge of the
poll at the eleftion of an alderman, fo the alderman
of each ward is judge of the poll at the eleftion of a
common-council man.
Thus the lord mayor, aldermen, and common-
council, when afiembled, may be deemed the city par¬
liament, refembling the great council of the nation.
F01 is ccnfifts of two houfes j one for the lord mayor
and aldermen, or the upper hoiffe } another for the
commoners or reprefentatives of the people, commonly
called the common-council men. And they have power
in their incorporate capacity to make and repeal bye¬
laws; and the citizens are bound to obey or fubmit to
Vol. XII. Part I.
thofe laws. When they meet in their incorporn^ ca- London,
pacitjq they wear deep blue iilk gowns : and their .? - -y-——
femblies are called the court of common-council% and their
ordinances ails of common-council. No aft can be per¬
formed in the name of the city of London without
their concurrence. But they cannot affemble without a
fummons from the lord mayor ; who, neveithclefs, is
obliged to call a common-council, whenever it ihall be
demanded, upon extraordinary occafions, by fix re¬
putable citizens and members of that court. 38
This corporation is affifted by two flieriffs and a re- ^berirTs.
corder. The Iheriffs are chartered officers, to perform
certain fuits and fervices, in the king’s name, within
the city of London and county of Middlefex, chofen
by the liverymen of the fcveral companies on Midfum-
mer day. Their office, according to Camden, m ge¬
neral, is to collect the public revenues within tiieir fe¬
veral jurifdiftions ; to gather into the exchequer alt
fines belonging to the crown ; to ferve the king’s writs
of procefs ; to attend the judges, and execute their or¬
ders; to impannel juries ; to compel headltrong and
obftinate men by the pojfe conutatus to fubmit to the de-
cilions of the law ; and to take care that all condemn¬
ed criminals be duly puniihed and executed. In par¬
ticular, in London, they are to execute the orders of
the common-round!, when they have refolved to ad-
dieis his majelty, or to petition parliament.
Ihe fheriffs, by virtue of their office, hold a court at
Guildhall every Wednefday and Friday, for aftiohs
entered at Wood-ftreet Compter; and on Thurfdays,
and Saturdays for thofe entered at the Poultry Comp¬
ter : of which the fheriffs being judges, each has his
affiftant, or deputy, who are called the judges of thofe
courts ; before whom are tried aftions of debt, tref-
pafs, covenant, &c. and where the teftimony of any
abfent wflnefs in writing is allowed to be good evi¬
dence. To each of thefe courts belong four attornies,
who, upon their being admitted by the court of aider-
men, have an oath adminiftered to them.
lo each of thefe courts likewife belong a fecondary,
a clerk of the papers, a prothonotary, and four clerks-
fitters. The fecondary’s office is to allow and return
all writs brought to remove clerks out of the laid
courts , the clerk of the papers files and copies all
declarations upon aftions; the prothonotary draws and
engroffes all declarations ; the clerk-fitters enter ac¬
tions and attachments, and take bail and verdifts. To
each of the compters, or prifons belonging to thefe
courts, appertain 16 ferjeants at mace, with a yeo¬
man to each, belides inferior officers, and the prifon-
keeper. »
In the Iheriffs court may be tried aftions of debt,
cafe, trefpafs, account, covenant, and all perfonal ac¬
tions, attachments, and fequeftratious. When an er¬
roneous judgement is given in either of the ffieriffs
courts of the city, the writ of error to reverfe this
judgement muft be brought in the court of huftings be¬
fore the lord mayor for that is the fuperior court.
The (heriffs of London may make arrefts and ferve
executions on the river Thames. ^
We do not read of a recorder till the 1304, who,Recorder,
by the nature of his office, feems to have been intended
as an affiftant to, or affeffor with, the lord mayor, in
the execution of his high oftice, in matters of juftice
and law. He is chofen by the lord mayor and alder-
-A- * me«
LON [ 186 ] LON
men only ; and takes place in all courts, and in the
common-ccunci!, before any one that hath not been
mayor. Of whom we have the following description
in one of the books of the chamber : “ He fhall be,
as is wont to be, one of the moft Ikilful and virtuous
apprentices of the law of the whole kingdom ; whpfe
office is always to lit on the right hand of the mayor,
in recording pleas, and palling judgements ;• and by
whom records and procefles, had before the lord mayor
and alderman at Great St Martin’s, ought to be re¬
corded by vycu'd of mouth before the judges affigned
there to correct errors. The mayor and aldermen have
therefore ufed commonly to fet forth all other bufi-
neffes, touching the city, before the king and his
council, as alfo in certain of the king’s courts, by Mr
Recorder, as a chief man, endued with wifdom, and
eminent for eloquence.”—Mr Recorder is looked up¬
on to be the mouth of the city, to deliver all addreffes
to the king, &c. from the corporation j and he is the
firlt officer in order of precedence that is paid a fa-
lary, which originally was no more than. 10I. fter-
ling per annum, with feme few perquilites 5 but it has
from time to time been augmented to 1000I. per
annum, and become the road to preferment in the
law. This office has fometimes been executed by a
deputy.
The next chartered officer of this corporation is the
chamberlain ; an officer of great repute and truft, and
is in the choice of the livery annually. This officer,
though chofen annually on Midfummer-day, is never
dilplaced during bis life, except fome very great crime
can be made out againft him. He has the keeping of
the moneys, lands, and goods, of the city orphans, or
takes good fecurity for the payment thereof when the
parties come to age. And to that end he is deemed
in the law a foie corporation, to him and his fuc-
ceffors, for orphans ; and therefore a bond or a recog¬
nizance made to him and his fucceflbrs, is recoverable
by his fucceflfors. This officer hath a court peculiarly
belonging to him. His office may be termed a public
treafury, colledling the culloms, moneys, and yearly
revenues, and all other payments belonging to the
corporation of the city. It was cuftomary for govern¬
ment to appoint the chamberlain receiver of the land
tax 5 but this has been difeontinued for feveral years
pail.
The other officers under the lord mayor are, 1, The
common ferjeant. He is to attend the lord mayor and
court of aldermen on court days, and to be in council
with them on all occafions, within or without the pre-
cin£ls or liberties of the city. He is to take care of
orphans ellates, either by taking account of them, or
to fign their indentures, before their palling the lord
mayor and court of aldermen. And likewife he is to
let, fet, and manage the orphans eftates, according to
his judgement, to the bell advantage. 2. The town
clerk } who keeps the original charter of the city, the
books, rolls, and other records, wherein are regiftered
the a£ls and proceedings of the city ; fo that he may
not be improperly termed the city-regifter : he is to
attend the lord mayor and aldermen at their courts,
and figns all public inftruments. 3. The city remem¬
brancer ; who is to attend the lord mayor on certain
days, his hufinefs being to put his lordlhip in mind of
the days he is to go abroad with the aldermen,
&c. He is to attend daily at the parliament houfe, London,
during the feffions, and to report to the lord mayor vv" 1
their tranfa&ions. 4. The fword-bearer j who is to
attend the lord mayor at his going abroad, and to carry
the fword before him, being the emblem of jullice.
This is an ancient and honourable office, reprelenting
the ftate and princely office of the king’s moll excel¬
lent majelly, in his reprefentative the lord mayor j and,
according to the rule of armory, “ He mull carry
the fword upright, the hilts being holden under his
bulk, and the blade diredlly up the midfl of his brealf,
and fo forth between the fvvord-bearer’s brow's.”
5. The common hunt ; whofe bulinefs it is to take
care of the pack of hounds belonging to the lord mayor
and citizens, and to attend them in hunting in thofe
grounds to which they are authorized by charter.
6. The common crier. It belongs to him and the ferjeant
at arms, to fummon all executors and adminiftrators
of freemen to appear, and to bring in inventories of the
perfonal ellates of freemen, within two months after
their deceafe : and he is to have notice of the appraife-
ments. He is alfo to attend the lord mayor on let days,
and at the courts held weekly by the mayor and aider-
men. 7. The water bailiff 5 whofe office is to look
after the prel’ervation of the river Thames againll all
encroachments •, and to look after the lifhermen for the
prefervation of the young fry, to prevent the dellroy-
ing them by unlawful nets. For that end, there are
juries for each county, that hath any part of it lying
on the lides or Ihores of the faid river •, which juries,
fummoned by the water bailiff at certain times, do make
inquiry of all offences relating to the river and the lilh,
and make their preferments accordingly. He is alfo
bound to attend the lord mayor on let days in the
week.—Thefe feven purchafe their places ; except the *
town clerk, who is chofen by the livery.
There are alfo three ferjeant carvers j three ferjeants
of the chaihber ; a ferjeant of the channel j four yeo¬
men of the water fide j an under water bailiff j two
yeomen of the chamber 5 two meal wreighters; two yeo¬
men of the wood wharfs $ a foreign taker j city mar-
Ihals. There are befides thefe, feven gentlemen’s men j
as the fword-bearer’s man, the common hunt’s two
men, the common crier’s man, and the carver’s three
men.
Nine of the foregoing officers have liveries of the
lord mayor, viz. the fword-bearer and his man, the
three carvers, and the four yeomen of the water
fide. All the reft have liveries from the chamber of
London.
The following officers are likewife belonging to the
city $ farmer of the markets, auditor, clerk of the
chamber, clerk to the commiffioners of the fewers,
clerk of the court of confcience, beadle of the fame
court, clerk of the city works, printer to the city,
juftice of the Bridge yard, clerk comptroller of the
Bridge houfe, fteward of the Borough, bailiff of the
Borough.
There is alfo a coroner, called fo from corona, i. e.
a crown, becaufe he deals principally with the crown,
or in matters appertaining to the imperial crowm of
England. See the article Coroner.
Befides thefe officers, there are feveral courts in this
city for the executing of juffice, viz. the court of huf-
tipgs, lord mayor’s court, &c. In the city there are
alfo
LON [i
London- alfo two fubordinate kinds of government. One exe-
' cuted by the alderman, deputy, and common-council
men, and their inferior officers, in each ward ; under
which form are comprehended all the inhabitants, free
or not free of the city. Every ward is therefore like
a little free ftate, and at the fame time fubje£t to the
lord mayor as chief magiftrate of the city. The
houfekeepers of each ward eleft their reprefentatives,
the common council, who join in making bye-laws for
the government of the city. JLhe officers and fervants
of each ward manage the affairs belonging to it, with¬
out the affiftance of the reft; and each has a court call¬
ed the wardmote, as has been already defcribed, for
the management of its own affairs. T. he other, by the
mafter, wardens, and court of affiftants, of the incor¬
porate companies ; whofe power reaches no farther
than over the members of their refpe&ive guilds or fra¬
ternities j except that in them is veiled the power to
choofe reprefentatives in parliament for the city, and all
thofe magiftrates and officers elefted by a common
hall} which companies are invefted with diftindl
powers, according to the tenor of their refpedtive
charters.
The military government of the city is lodged in a
lieutenancy, confifting of the lord mayor, aldermen,
and other principal citizens, who receive their autho¬
rity by a commiffion from the king. Thofe have un¬
der their command the city trained bands, confifting
of fix regiments of foot, diftinguilhed by the names of
the white, orange, yellow, blue, green, and red,, each
containing eight companies of 150 men, amounting in
all to 7 200. Befides thefe fix regiments, there is a corps
called the artillery company, from its being taught the
military exercife in the artillery ground. This com¬
pany is independent of the reft, and conlifts of 700 or
800 volunteers. All thefe, with two regiments of foot
of 800 men each commanded by the lieutenant of the
Tower of London, make the whole militia of this city j
which, exclufive of Weftminfter and the borough of
Southwark, amounts to about 10,000 men.
The trading part of the city of London is divided
Companies, into 89 companies •, though fome of them can hardly be
called fo, becaufe they have neither charters, halls, nor
liveries. Of thefe 89 companies, 55 have each a hall
for tranfa&ing the bulinefs of the corporation j and
this confifts of a mafter or prime warden, a court of af¬
fiftants, and livery.—Twelve of thefe companies are
fuperior to the reft both in antiquity and wealth j and
of one of thofe I 2 the lord mayors have generally made
themfelves free at their ele&ion. Thefe companies are

I. Remarkable buildings, &c. in the Cirr.—The ori-London
ginal bridge, which ftands in Bridge ward, was ofBndSe'
wood, and appears to have been firft built between the
years 993 and roi6 ; but being burnt down about the
year 1x36, it was rebuilt of wood in 1163. I he ex-
pences, however, of maintaining and repairing it be¬
came fo burdenfome to the inhabitants of the city,
that they refolved to build a ftone bridge a little weft-
ward of the wooden one. This building was begun in
1176, and finiftied in 1209; and was 915 feet long,
44 feet high, and 73 feet wide; but houfes being
built on each fide, the fpace between was only 23
feet.
This great work was founded on enormous piles
driven as clofely as poffible together : on their tops
were laid long planks 10 inches thick, ftrongly bolted ^
and on them was placed the bafe of the pier, the
lowermoft ftones of which were bedded in pitch, to
prevent the water from damaging the work : round
all were the piles which were called the Jlerlings, de-
figned for the prefervation of the foundation piles.
Thefe contrafled the fpace between the piers fo great¬
ly, as to occafion at the retreat of every tide a fall of
five feet, or a number of temporary catarafts, which
fince the foundation of the bridge have occafioned the
lofs of many thoufand lives. The number of arches
was 19, of unequal dimenfions, and greatly deformed
by the fterlings and the houfes on each fide, which
overhung and leaned in a moft terrific name. In
moft places they hid the arches, and nothing appeared
but the rude piers. Within recolle&ion, frequent
arches of ftrong timber croffed the ftreet from the tops
of the houfes to keep them together, and from falling
into the river (a). Nothing but ufe could preferve /
the quiet of the inmates, who foon grew deaf to the
noife of the falling waters, the clamours of watermen,
or the frequent flirieks of drowning wretches. In

William Hewet cloth-worker, may not improperly be mentioned in this place. About tue year 1536,. rvhen
his mafter lived in one of thofe tremendous houfes, a fervant maid was playing with his only daughter in her
arms in a window over the water, and accidentally dropt the child. Young Ofborne, who was witneis to the
misfortune, inftantly fprang into the river, and beyond all expectation, brought her fafe to the terrified fa¬
mily ! Several perfons of rank paid their addreffes to her when ftie was marriageable, among others the earl of
Shrewfbury 3 but Sir William gratefully decided in favour of Ofborne : OJborne, fays he,her, and OJborne

tne arch is to be 600 feet, being the width to which, by
Mr Jell op’s report, the river ought to be contradfed. The

ject of great attention, not only to the committee en¬

man accuracy, counted on it above 30 hcMs. The
cud map of the city in 1597 reprefents them in a molt
ornble cluller.—An unparalleled calamity happened
on th:s bridge within four years after it was finilhed.
A fire began on it at the Southwark end ; multitudes
ot people rulhed out of London to extinguifii it j while
they were engaged in this charitable defign, the fire
jciztd cn the oppofite end, and hemmed in the crowd.
Aoove 3000 perfons perifhed in the Harnes, or were
drowned by overloading the vefl'els which were hardy
enough to attempt their relief.
The narrownefs of the palTage on this bridge having
occafioned the lofs of many lives from the number of
carriages continually palling ; and the llraitnefs of’the
arches, with the enormous fize of the fterlings, which
occupied one-fourth part of the water-wav, having al¬
io occaliened frequent and fatal accidents, as already
mentioned ; the magiftrates of London in 1736 ob¬
tained an aff of parliament for improving and widen¬
ing the paffage over and through the bridge, which
granted them a toll for every carriage and horfe paffing
over it, and for every vefiel with goods palling through
it : but thefe tolls proving infufficient, were abolilhed
by an ad made in 1758 for explaining, amending, and
rendering the former aft more effeaUal; and for grant¬
ing the city of London money towards carrying on
that work. In confequence of thefe adls of parliament,
a temporary wooden bridge was built, and the houfes
on the old bridge were taken down. Inftead of a
naiiow fireet 23. feet wide, there is now a paffage of
3 1 feet for carriages, with a railed pavement of Hone
on each fide 7 feet broad for the ufe of foot paffen-
gers. I he fides are fecured by Hone baluftrades, en¬
lightened in the night with lamps. The paffage through
the bridge is enlarged by throwing the two middle
arches into one, and by other alterations and improve¬
ments } notwithflanding which, however, it is Hill
gieaJy fuojeft to its former inconveniences.—Under
tne fiift, fecond, and fourth arches, from the north
fide of the bridge, and now likewife towards the fouth-
e:n extremities, there are engines worked by the flux
and reflux of the river, the water of which they raife to
lucn^ a height as to iupply many parts of the city.
Inoie engines were contrived in 1582 by one Peter
Monce a Dutchman, and are called London-brifoe

to conlider of the requifite improvements in and about

London, and round it is the following one :—“ This pillar was
fet up in perpetual remembrance of the mqft dreadful
burning of this Proteftant city, begun and carried on
by the treachery and malice of the Popifti faition, in
the beginning of September, in the year of our Lord
1666, in order to their carrying on their horrid plot
for extirpating the Proteftant religion and old Engiifb
liberty, and introducing Popery and ilavery.” Dr
Wendeborn, in his account of London, ohierves, that
the monument, though not much above too years old,
bears viiible marks of decay already ; and it will not
probably be long before it muft be pulled down. Some
are of opinion that this is occalioned by the fault of
the architedl, others by the continual (baking of the
ground by coa.ches; but the doctor inclines to the
47 latter opinion.
The rower. Eaftward of the bridge and monument (lands the
Tower, which gives name to another ward. It is the
chief fortrefs of the city, and fuppofed to have-been
originally built by William the Conqueror. It ap¬
pears, however, to have been raifed upon the remains
of a more ancient fortrefs, erected probably by the Ro¬
mans : for in 1720, in digging on the fouth fide of
what is called Ceefar's Chapel, there were difcovered
fome old foundations of (tone, three yards broad, and
(o firongly cemented that it was with the utrnoft dif¬
ficulty they were forced up. The firft work (accord¬
ing to Mr Pennant) feems to have been fuddenly Hung
up in 1066 by the Conqueror, on his taking pofleftion
of the capital; and included in.it a part of the ancient
wall.
The great fquare tower, called the White Tower,
was erected in the year 1078, when it arofe under the
direttions of Gundulph biihop of Rochefter, who was a
great military architect. This building originally flood
by itfelf. Fitz-Stephen gives it the name of Arx Pa~
latina, “ the Palatine Tower j” the commander of
which had the title of Palatine beftovved on him. With¬
in this tower is a very ancient chapel for the ufe of fuch
of our kings and queens who wiftied to pay their de¬
votion here. In 1092 a violent temped did great in¬
jury to the Tower •, but it was repaired by William
Rufus and his fucceffor. The firft added another ca-
ftellated building on the fouth fide between it and the
Thames, which was afterwards called St Thomas's
Tower.
The Tower was firft enclofed by William Long-
champ bifhop of Ely and chancellor of England, in
the reign of Richard I. This haughty prelate having
a quarrel with John, third brother to Richard, under
pretence of guarding againft his defigns, furrounded
the whole with wails embattled, and made on the out-
fide a vaft ditch, into which, in after times, the water
from the Thames was introduced. Different princes
added other works. The prefent contents within the
walls are 12 acres and 5 rods, the circuit on the out-
fide of the ditch 1052 feet. It was again enclofed
with a mud wall, by Henry III. : this was placed at a
diftance from the ditch, and occafioned the taking
down part of the city-wall, which was refented by the
citizens; who, pulling down this precinct of mud,
were punifhed by the king with a fine of a thoufand
merks.
The Lions Toiver was built by Edward IV. It was
originally called the Bulwark, but received the former
name from its ufe. A menagery had very long been
a piece of regal date : Henry I. had his at his manor
of Woodftock, where he kept lions, leopards, lynxes,
porcupines, and feveral other uncommon beads. They
were afterwards removed to the Tower. Edward 11.
commanded the fheriffs of London to pay the keepers
of the king’s leopards fixpence a-day for the fufte-
nance of the leopards, and three halfpence a-day for
the diet of the keeper out of the fee-farm of the city.
The royal menagery is to this day exceedingly well
fupplied.
In 1758 the Tower ditch was railed all round. New
barracks were fome years ago eredled on the Tower
wharf, which parts it from the river •, and upon the
wharf is a line of 61 pieces of cannon, which are fired
upon date holidays. On this fide of the Tower the
ditch is narrow, and over it is a drawbridge. Parallel
to the wharf, within the walls, is a platform 70 yards
in length, called the Ladies Line, becaufe much fre¬
quented by the ladies in the fummer 5 it being (haded
in the infide with a row of lofty treees, and without
is a delightful profpect of the (hipping with boats paf-
fing and repafling on 'the river Thames. You afcend
this line by (tone Heps, and being once upon it you may
walk almoft round th^ walls of the Tower without in¬
terruption.
The principal entrance into the Tower is by a gate
to the weft, large enough to admit coaches and heavy
carriages $ but thefe are firft admitted through an out¬
ward gate, fituated without the ditch upon the hill,
and muft pafs a flout (tone bridge built over the ditch
before they can approach the main entrance. There
is, befides, an entrance near the very fouth-weft corner
of the Tower outward wall, for perions on foot, over
the drawbridge already mentioned to the wharf.
There is alfo a water-gate, commonly called Traitor's
gate, through which it has been cuftomary to convey
traitors and other (late prifoners to or from the Tower,
and which is feldom opened on any other occafion ;
but the lords committed to the Tower in 1 746 were
publicly admitted at the main entrance. Over this gate
is a regular building, terminated at each end by two
round towers, on which are embrafures for pointing
cannon. In this building there are the infirmary, the
mill, and 'the water-works that fupply the Tower with
water.

The next place worthy of obfervation is the Mint, which comprehends near one-third of the Tower, and
contains houfes for all the officers belonging to the coinage. On paffing the principal gate you fee the White
lower, built by William the Conqueror. This is a large, fquare, irregular done building, lituated almoll
in the centre, no one fide anfwcring to another, nor any of its watch-towers, of which there are four at the
top, built alike. One of thefe towers is now converted into an obfervatory. In the firft dory are two noble
rooms, one of which is a fmall armoury for the fea-fervice, it having various forts of arms, very curioufly laid
up, for above 10,000 feamen. In the other room are many clofets and prefles, all filled with warlike engines
and indruments of death. Over this are two other floors, one principally filled with arms j the other with
arms and other warlike indruments, as fpades, (hovels, pickaxes, and chevaux de frize. In the upper dory
-are kept match, (heep-lkins, tanned hides, &c. and in a little room called Julius Caefar’s chapel, are depofited
fome records, containing perhaps the ancient ufages and cudoms of the place. In this building are alfo pre-
ferved the models of the new-invented engines of deftru&ion that have from time to time been prefented to
the government. Near the fouth-wed angle of the White Tower is the Spanifli armoury, in which are de¬
pofited the fpoils of what was vainly called the‘Invincible Armada •, in order to perpetuate to lated poderity
the memory of that fignal viflory obtained by the Lngliffi over the whole naval power of Spain in the reign
of Philip II.
You are now come to the grand dorehoufe, a noble building to the northward of the White Tower, tha&
extends 245 feet in length and 60 in breadth. It was begun by King James II. who built it to the fird floor ;
but it was finiffied by King William III. who erefted that magnificent room called the New or Small Ar¬
moury, in which that prince, with Queen Mary his confort, dined in great form, having all the warrant work¬
men and labourers to attend them, d re fled in white gloves and aprons, the ufual badges of the order of ma-
fonry. I o this noble room you are led by a folding door, adjoining to the eafi end of the Tower chapel,
which leads to a grand daircafe of 50 eafy deps. On the left fide of the uppermod landing-place is the
work-ffiop, in which are condantly employed about 14 furbiffiers, in cleaning, repairing, and newr-placing the
arms. On entering the armoury, you fee what they call a wildernefs of arms, fo artfully difpofed, that at
one view you behold arms for near 80,000 men, all bright and fit for fervice ; a fight which it is impoflible
to behold without adonifiiment 5 and befide thole expofed to view, there were, before the late war, 16 cheds
(hut up, each ched holding about 1000 mulkets. The arms were originally diipofed by Mr Harris, who con¬
trived to place them in this beautiful order, both here and in the guard-chamber of Hampton-court. He was a
common gunfmith 5 but after he had performed this work, which is the admiration of people of all nations, he
was allowed a penlion from the crown for his ingenuity.
Upon the ground floor, under the fmall armoury, is a large room of equal dimenfions with that, fupported.
by 20 pillars, all hung jound with implements of war. This room, which is 24 feet high, has a paltage in the
middle 16 feet wide. At the fight of fuch a variety of the mod dreadful engines of dedru&ion, before whofe
thunder the mod fuperb edifices, the nobled works of art, and numbers of the human fpecies, fall together in one
common and undiftinguilhed ruin } one cannot help wiffiing that thole horrible inventions had dill lain, like a
falfe conception, in the wTomb of nature, never to have been ripened into birth.
The horfe armoury is a plain brick building, a little to the eadv/ard of the White Tovrer j and is an edifice
rather convenient than elegant, where the fpe&ator is entertained with a reprefentation of thofe kings and heroes
of our own nation, with whofe gallant anions* it is to be fuppofed he is well acquainted 5 fome of them equipped
and fitting on horfeback, in the fame bright and (hining armour they were ufed to wTear when they performed
thofe glorious afrions which gave them a didinguiflied place in the Britilh annals.

Cuflomhoufe, is the Irimty Iloije ; a fociety founded in
1515, at a period in which the Brititidi navy began to
a flume a fyftem. The founder was Sir Thomas Spert,
comptroller of the navy, and commander of the great
fhip Henry Grace de Dieu. It is a corporation,
confiding of a mailer, four wardens, eight affiit-
ants, and eighteen elder brethren ; feledted from com¬
manders in the navy and the merchants fervice j
and now and then a compliment Is paid to one or
two of our firil nobility. They may be confidered
as guardians of our ihips, military and commercial.
Their powers are very extenfive : they examine the ma-
thematicial children of Chrift’s hofpital, and the maders
of his majedy’s (hips ; they appoint pilots for the river
l names; fettle the general rates of pilotage 5 eredt
light houfes and fea marks ; grant licenfes to poor
feamen, not free of the city, to row on the Thames;
prevent foreigners from ferving on board our ihit s
without licenie ; puniih feamen for mutiny and defer-
Lion ; hear and determine complaints ot officers and
men in the merchants fervice, but liable to appeal to
the judge of the court of admiralty ; fuperintend the
deepening and cleanfing of the river Thames, a d
have under their juriidicfion the ballad office ; have
powers to buy lands, and receive donations for chari¬
table ufes ; and in confequence, relieve annually many
thoufands of poor feamen, their widows, and orphans.
It is in this houfs the bufinefs of the inditution is
carried on : but the mother houfe'is at Deptford, the
corporation being named, “ the mader, wardens, and
affidants of the guild or fraternity of the mod glori¬
ous and undivided Trinity, and of St Clement, in
the pariffi of Deptford Strond, in the county of
Kent.”
Between Aldgate and the Tower is the dreet called
the Minor;es, from fame poor ladies of the order of
St Clare, or minorefles. They had been invited to
London by Blanch queen of Navarre, and wife to Ed¬
mund earl of Lancader, who founded a convent for
them in 1293. On the fuppreffion of the monaderies
it was converted into a dwelling houfe for ffime of the
nobility, and is now in ‘he pofieffion of the Dartmouth
family, dill of late years, the Minories were but a
defpicable dreet} but have now been excellently re-
builtv and are as elegant as any in the city.
On the wed fide of the city walls at this place, dood
the houfe of the Crunched or CroJJed Friars, an order
inflituted at Bologna in 1169, and of which a branch
fettled in England in 1 244, where they were accom¬
modated with a houfe in this place by two citizens
named Ralph Hqfler and William Sabernas, who became
members of their order. Henry VIII. granted their
houfe to Sir Thomas Wyat the elder, who built a
handfome manfion on part of the ground where it
dood. This manfion became afterwards the refidence
of John Lord Lumley, a celebrated warrior in the
time of Henry VIII. In procefs of time, it was con¬
verted into a navy office : but this office being remov-

Bii/ingfgate was a imall port for the reception of fhip-gate!^
ping, and for a confiderable time the mod important
place for the landing of aimed every article of com¬
merce. In the time of King William, Eiilingfgate
began to be celebrated as a ftth-mavket. In 1699 it
was by act of parliament made a free port for fith to
be fold there every day except Sunday •, but Mr Pen¬
nant informs us, that the objeft of this has long been
frudrated, and that fifli are now no longer to be had
there in perfeclion. The fame author gives a lid of
the fiffi which in the time of Edward HI. were
brought to the London market; the monarch himfelf
having condefcended to regulate the prices, that his
fubjefts might not be irnpofed upon by thofe who
foid them. Among thefe were the conger-eel and
porpoife, neither of which is now admitted to any
table. A pike at that time cod 6r. 8d.; whence cur
author concludes, that it was an exotic fiffi, and brought
oyer at a vad expence. Some fifties are mentioned^in
his Hit with which this naturalid owns himfelf unac¬
quainted, viz. the barkey, b?’an, batrile, cropling, and
rumb. In Archbiffiop Nevill’s great fead is mention¬
ed alfo a fitffi named thirle-poole, unknown at prefent.
Seals were formerly accounted a filli ; and thefe, to¬
gether with the durgeon and porpoife, were the only
freffi fidi permitted by the 3^ of Henry VIII. to be
bought of any dranger at fea between England, France
Flanders, and Zealand. ° ’ ^
Limedreet ward is remarkable for a very large build- Leaatlihall.
ing of great antiquity, called Leadenha/l, with fiat
battlements leaded on the top, and a fpacious fquare
in the middle. In 1309 it was the houfe of Sir Hugh
Nevill, knight; in 1384, of Humphry Bohun earl of
Hereford ; in 1408 it became the property of the ce¬
lebrated Whittington, who prefented it to the mayor
and commonalty of London; and in 1419, a public
granary was erefted here by Sir Sifnon Eyre, a citi¬
zen and draper, who built it with done in its prefent
form. This granary was defigned as a prefervative
againd famine, and to be kept always full of corn,
whnffi defign was ror fome time happily anfwered. The
houfe came to be ufed for many other purpofes befides
that of a granary ; as for keeping the artillery and
arms, of the city. Preparations for any kind of pageantry
or ti’umph were alfo made here ; .and from its drength
the place was confidered as the chief fortrefs within
the city in cafe of any popular infurre&ion, and was
likewife the place from whence alms were didributed.
In this edifice are warehoufes for the fale of leather, Col-
cheder baize, meal, and wool. Adjoining to Leaden-
hall is a market, thence called Leadenhallmarket con-
diting of five confiderable fquares or courts, and rec¬
koned one of the greated markets in Europe for
fiedi and other prpvifions; as well as for leather
green hides, and wool. • A little to the eadward is --
the India lloufe, built in 1726, on the fpot occupied The India--
by Sir William Craven, mayor in 1610. AccordingHoufe-
to Mr Pennant, this houfe “ is not worthy of the lords
of Indodan.”

cers-hall. The front is a fort of veitibule 5 the bafe
ruliic, the ornamental columns above Ionic. Within
is a court leading to a fecond elegant building, which
contains a hall and offices, where the debt of above
250 mil liens is punftually difeharged. Of late years
two wings of uncommon elegance, detigned by Sir
Robert Taylor, have been added, at the expence of
a few houfes, and of the church of St Chriftopher’s
le Stocks. “ T he name of the projector of this national
glory (fays Mr Pennant), was Mr James Paterfon of
Scotland. This palladium of out country was in
17 So laved from the fury of an infamous banditti
by the virtue of its citizens, who formed fuddenly a
volunteer company, and overawed the mifereants ;
while the chief magiRrate ikulked trembling in his
manlion-houfe, and left his important charge to its
fate. This important building has ever fince been
very properly guarded by the military ; who, in paf-
fing through the city, have often given offence to
many bufy charadlers who would drive to preferve the
city rights at the expence of the national deftrudfion.
A lord mayor was the laft who interefted himfelf by
applying to Mr Grenville, who gave him to under-
11 and, that if the guards were not quietly permitted
to difeharge their duty, the bank would be removed
to Somerfet-houfe.”
At the extremity of Tbreadneedle-ffreet is Mer-
chant- Taylors Hall. In this ilreet alfo is the South Sea
Houfe, firil eflablilhed in 1711 for the purpofe of an
exclulive trade to the South fea, and for fupplying
Spanidi America with negroes.
Near the junction of Throgmorton-dreet with
Broad-dreet dcod a magnificent houfe built by Crom¬
well earl of Effex ; after whole fall, the houfe and
gardens were bought by the Drapers company. The
houfe u’as dedroyed in the great tire, but rebuilt for the
ufe of the company in a magnificent manner.
Mr Pennant informs us, that St Giles's church in the
fields, and a few houfes to the wed of it, in the year
1600, were barely feparated from Broad-drert. The
church is fuppofed to have belonged to an hofpital for
lepers, founded about the year' 1117, by Matilda queen
to Henry I. In ancient times it was cudomary here
to prefent to malefaftors, on their wTay to the gallows
(which, about the year 1413, was removed from
Sraithfield, and placed between St Giles’s high-dreet
and Hog lane (c), a great bowl of ale, as the lad

the ule of the Germans and other fugitive Protedants,
and afterwards to the Dutch as a place for preach¬
ing. A part of it was alfo converted into a glafs-
houfe for Venice glafs, in which the manufadlure was
carried on by artids from that city, and patronifed by
the duke of Buckingham. The place was afterwards

chants to meet and tranfaft bufinefs, provided the city
would find him a convenient fituation for the fame.
Mr Pennant informs us, that one Richard Clough a
Weldunan, originally Sir Thomas’s fervant, fird put
him on this defign by a letter from Antwerp, in which
he reproached the London merchants with having no
place to tranfaft their bufinefs, but walking about in
the rain, more like pedlars than merchants. The ci¬

the conqued. Here was alfo a village and church denominated St John the Evangelif, which fell to decay,
and vvas fucceeded by that of Mnry bonrne, corrupted into Mary la-bonne. In 1626, Queen Henrietta
Maria was compelled by her prie' * • r,ke walk bv way of penance to Tyburn. What her offence was we

cornice between the two pediments, are the king’s
arms in relievo^ on each fide of this entrance is a
range of windows placed between demi-columns and
pilaifers of the compofite order, above which runs a
baluftrade. This building is 56 feet high ; and from
the centre, in this front, rifes a lanthorn and turret
178 feet high, on the top of which is a vane of gilt
brafs made in the ftiape of a gralhopper, the creft

London. In building this expenfive Itruchire there was an eye
—■' not only to magnificence, and to accommodate the
merchants, but alfo to reimburfe the expence. For
this reafon a gallery was built over the four fides of
the Royal Exchange. This was divided into 2CO lliops,
which were let out to haberdalhers, milliners, &c. and
which for feveral years were well occupied. But thefe
lliops have now for a long time been deferted, and the
galleries are let out to the Royal Exchange Affurance-
Olfice, the Merchant-feamen’s Office, the Marine So¬
ciety, and to audfioneers, &c. Under the whole area
there are the fineft dry vaults that can be found any¬
where, which are let out to the Eaft-India Company
to depofite their pepper. In the turret is a good clock,
with four dials, which is well regulated every day, fo
that it becomes a ftandard of time to all the mercan¬
tile part of the town 5 and it goes with chimes at
three, fix, nine, and twelve o’clock, playing upon
twelve bells. The outfide of this grand fabric fuffers
very much in its elegance from the fhops that furround
it, and are built within its w^alls j and which are occu¬
pied by bookfellers, toymen, cutlers, hofiers, watch¬
makers, &c.
South of the Royal Exchange, and near the wreft

which is a handfome and commodious building.
In Walbrook ward is the Manjion-houfe, for the re-
fidence of the lord mayor. This edifice was begun in
1739, and finifhed in 1753. It is built of Portland
ftone, with a portico of fix fluted columns, of the
Corinthian order, in the front. The bafement ftory
is very mafly, and confifts of ruftic work ; in the centre
«f it is the door, w'hich leads to the kitchen, cellars,
and other offices. On each fide riles a flight of fteps,
leading up to the portico, in the middle of wdiich is
the principal entry. The ftone baluftrade of the flairs
is continued along the front of the portico, and the
'Columns fupport a large angular pediment, adorned
with a group of figures in bas relief, reprefenting the
dignity and opulence of the city of London. It is an
extremely heavy building, of an oblong form, and its
depth is the long fide, having feveral magnificent apart¬
ments, which are not, however, wTell lighted, on account
of the houfes that furround it.
„ Behind the Manfion-houfe is St Stephen's Church,

original caufe of its ereftion no memorial remains; but ' ^ J
it is conjeflured, that as London was a Roman city,

having founded St John’s college in Oxford in 1557*
appointed this fchool as a feminary for it, and efta-
blifhed at Oxford 46 fellowlhips for fcholars elecled

is 153 feet long, 50 broad, and 55 high, adorned with
the royal arms, and thofe of the city and its compa¬

full length, relerabling exaflly that at Northampton.
Having at length fallen to decay, it was rebuilt in
14^1 by John Hutherby mayor of the city, at the ex¬
pence of feveral citizens, being now ornamented with
various images, as thofe of the Rcfurreclion, the Vir¬
gin Mary, &c. As the magnificent proceflions took
this road, it was new gilt'at every public entry. After
the Reformation, the images gave fo much offence,
that it was thought proper to fubftitute that of Diana
in place of the Virgin Mary. This, however, w’as
relented by Queen Elizabeth, who offered a reward
for the difcovery of the offenders. As fire imagined
that a crofs, the fymbol of the Chriftian religion,
could not juftly give offence to any profeffor of that

mit and gilt *, but in 1643, ^ Parliament ordered the

Splendid tournaments were held between the Crofs
and Sopers-lane in the year 1331 ; but as Queen Phi¬
lippa and a great number of other ladies, dreifed in rich
attire, were fitting on the upper fcaffolding to behold
’the fports, the feat gave way, and they fuddenly fell
down among the knights and others who flood below j
many of whom were grievoufly hurt. The carpenters
were faved from punifliment by the intercefflon of the
queen •, but the king, to prevent accidents of the like
nature, ordered a building of flone to be erected near
Bow church, from whence the queen and other ladies
might behold fuch fpeftacles in fafety. This w^as ufed
for the fame purpofe till the year 1410, when Henry IV.
granted it to certain mercers, who converted it into

murder of Thomas 5 and fuch was his reputation for
fanftity, that it was dedicated to him even before he
w'as canonized, and that in conjundlion with the Vir¬
gin Mary herfelf. The wdiole was granted by King
Henry VIII. to the company of mercers. It was
deftroyed by the great fire in 1666 ; but rebuilt by the
mercers company, who ^have their hall here.—Imme¬

a cburch on this Ipot, built by the Cbriflians in the
time of the Romans, was confirmed : when he fearch-
ed for the foundations for nis own delign, he met
with thofe of the original prtjbi/teriuni, or femicircular
chancel, ti^e
old church. They confided only of
Kentish rubble done, artfully worked, and conlolidated
with exceedingly hard mortar, m the Roman manner,
much excelling the fuperftruilure. He explodes the
notion of there having been here a ten.pie of Diana,
and the difeovery of the horns of animals ufed in the
fierifices to that goddefs, on which the opinion had
been founded, no fuch having been difeovered in all his
fe arches.
The fir ft church is fuppofed to have been deftroyed
in the Diocletian perfecution, and to have been re¬
built in the reign of Conftantine. This was again
bemoliihed by the pagan Saxons; and reftcred, in
60s, by Sebert, a petty prince, ruling in thefe parts,
under Ethelbert king of Kent, the firft_ Chriftian
monarch of the Saxon race j who, at the inftance of
St Auguftine, appointed IMelitus the firft biftrop of
London. Evkemvald, the fon of King Ofta, fourth
in fuoceftion from Melitus, ornamented his cathedral
very highly, and improved the revenues with his own
patrimony. He was moft defervedly canonized : for
the very litter, in which he was carried in his laft ill-
nefs, continued many centuries to cure fevers by the
touch ; and the very chips, carried to the fick, reftored
them to health !
When the city of London was deftroyed by fire, in
1086, this church was burnt ; the biihop Mauritius
began to rebuild it, and laid the foundations, which
remained till its fecond deftruftion, from the fame
caufe, in the laft century. Notwithftanding Mauri¬
tius lived twenty years after he had begun this pious
work, and Bithop Beauvages enjoyed the fee twenty
more, yet fuch was the grandeur of > the defign, that
it remained unfinilhed. The firft had the ruins of
the Palatine Tower beftowed on him, as materials for
the building ; and Henry I. beftowed on Beauvages
part of the ditch belonging to the Tower, which,
with purchafes made by himfelf, enabled him to en-
clofe the whole with a wall. The fame monarch grant¬
ed, beudes, that every ihip which brought ftone for the
church, ftiould be exempted from tell j he gave him
alfo all the great fiih taken in his precin&s, except the
tongues j and, laftly, he fecured to him and his fuccef-
Tor the delicious tythes of all his venifon in the county
of LiYex.
The ftyle of the ancient cathedral was a moft beau¬
tiful Gothic } over the eaft end was an elegant cir¬
cular window; alterations were made in the ends of
the two tranfepts, io that their form is not delivered
down to us in the ancient plans •, and from the central
tower rofe a lofty and moft graceful fpire. 1 he dimen-
fions, as taken in 1309, were thefe: I ne length fix
hundred and ninety feet ; the breadth a hundred and
twenty 5 the height of the roof of the weft part, from
the floor, one hundred and two ; oi the eaft part, a
hundred and eighty-eight; of the tower, two hundred
and fixty j of the fpire, which was made of wood cover¬
ed with lead, two hundred and feventy-four. d. he
whole fpace the church occupied was three acres, three
roods, and twenty-one perches.
We may be aftoniftied at this amazing building, and
naturally inquire what fund could fupply money to
fupport fo vaft an expence. But monarchs refigneif
their revenues reflating from the cuftoins due for the
materials, which were brought to the adjacent wharfs •,
they furniilied wood from the royal forefts : prelates
gave up much of their revenues and, what was more
than all, by the pious bait of indulgences, and remif-
fions of penance, brought in from the good people ot
this realm moft amazing fums. Pope Innocent HI.
in 1252, gave a releafe oi fixty days penance j the
archbitiiop of Cologne gave, a few years before, a re¬
laxation of fifty days} and Boniface archbiihop ot
Canterbury, forty days.
The high altar dazzled with gems and gold, the
gifts of its numerous votaries. John king of France,
when prifaner in England, firft paying his refpedis to
St Erkenwald’s fhrine, offered four bafons of gold :
and the gifts at the obfequies of princes, foreign and
Britifh, were of immenfe value. On the day of the
converfion of the tutelar faint, the charities were pro¬
digious, firft to the fouls, when an indulgence of forty
days pardon was given, vere pcEnttenlibur, contntis et

The holinefs of this place did not prevent thieves
and profligates of all denominations from lurking within
the precincts, and committing, under the favour of the
night, murders and every fort of crime. Edward I.
gave the dean and canons permiflion to enclofe the
whole within a wall \ and to have gates to be fhut
every night, to exclude all diforderly people. Within
thefe walls, on the north-weft fide, was the bifhop’s

raifed among the nobility and citizens, to fupport fuch preachers as were (as was often the cafe) called to town

-• James I. to repair the cathedral, the celebrated Inigo
Jones was appointed to the work. But it was not at¬
tempted till the year 1633, w^en Laud laid the firft
ftone, and Inigo the fourth. That great architeft
begun with a moft notorious impropriety, giving to
the well end a portico of the Corinthian order, beau¬
tiful indeed, to this ancient Gothic pile ; and to the
ends of the two tranfepts Gothic fronts in a moll hor¬
rible llyle. The great fire made way for the reltoring
of this magnificent pile in its prefent noble form by
Sir Chriltopher Wren, an architect worthy of fo great
a defign.
It is built of fine Portland Hone, in form of a crofs.
On the outfide are two ranges of pilafters, confiding
of a hundred and twenty each ; the lower range of
the Corinthian order, and the upper of the compofite.
The fpaces between the arches of the windows and
the architrave of the lower order, are filled with a
great variety of curious enrichments, as are alfo thofe
above. On the north fide is a portico, the afcent to
which is by twelve deps of black marble, and its dome
iupported by fix very large columns. Over the dome
is a pediment, the face of which is engraved wfith the
royal arms, regalia, and other ornaments. On the
fouth is a portico, the afcent to which is by twenty-
five deps, and its dome fupported by fix columns, cor-
refpending with thofe on the north fide. The wed
front is graced with a mod magnificent portico, fup¬
ported by twrelve lofty Corinthian columns: over thefe
are eight columns of the compofite order, which fup-
port a noble pediment, crowmed with its acroteria, and
in this pediment is the hidory of St Paul’s converfion,
boldly carved in bas relief. The afcent to this portico
is by a flight of deps of black marble, extending the
whole length of the portico $ and over each corner of
the wed front is a beautiful turret. A vad dome, or
cupola, rifes in the centre of the building. Twenty
feet above the roof of the church is a circular range
of thirty-two columns with niches, placed exactly
againd others within. ,Thefe are terminated by their
entablature, which fupports a handfome gallery, adorn¬
ed rvith a done baludrade. Above the columns lad
mentioned is a range of piladers, with windows be¬
tween them : and from the entablature of thefe, the
diameter of the dome gradually decreafes. On the
fummit of the dome is an elegant balcony, from the
centre of which runs a beautiful lanthorn, adorned
with Corinthian columns. The whole is crowned
with a copper ball, fupporting a crofs, both finely gilt.
Within, the cupola dands on eight dupendous pillars,
curioufly adorned : the roof of the choir is fupported
'tiy fix pillars, and that of . the church by two ranges,
98 ] LON
confiding of twenty more. The roof of the church
and choir is adorned with arches and fpacious periphe¬
ries of enrichments, admirably carved in done. Quite
round the infide of the cupola, there is a whifpering
iron balcony, or gallery, the top of which is richly
painted by Sir James Thornhill.
The fird done of this fuperb edifice was laid on
June 21, 1675 > and the building was completed in
1710 j but the whole decorations were not finiflied till
1723. It wras a mod fingular circumdance, that, not-
withdanding it was 35 years in building, it w'as begun
and finiflied by one architpfl, and under one prelate,
Henry Compton bilhop of London. The church of
St Peter’s was 135 years in building, in the reigns of
19 popes, and went through the hands of twelve archi¬
tects. It is not, as often midaken, built after the mo¬
del of that famous temple : it is the entire conception
of our great countryman, and has been preferred in
fome refpe&s, by a judicious writer, to even the Ro¬
man Bafilica. Its dimenfions are lefs. The compa¬
rative view is given in the Parentalia, and copied in
London and its Environs. The height of St Peter’s,
to the top of the crofs, is 437 feet and an half j that
of St Paul’s 340 feet; fo that, from its fituation, it is
lofty enough to be feen from the fea. The length
of the fird is 729 feet; of the latter, 500. The great-
ed breadth of St Peter’s is 364; of St Paul’s, 180.
In the reigns of James I. and Charles I. the body
of this cathedral was the common refort of the poli¬
ticians, the news-mongers, and idle in general. It
was called Par/Z's ’ivalh; and is mentioned in the old
plays and other books of the times.
Nothwithdanding the magnificence of this noble pile,
however, it is remarked to have many defefts. Its
fituation is fuch, that it cannot be viewed at a didance.
The divifion of the porticos, and the whole druflure,
into two dories on the outfide, certainly indicates a like
divifion wfithin, which is acknowledged to be a f^ult.
The dome, it has alfo been obferved, bears too great a
proportion to the red of the pile, and ought to have
been raifed exactly in the centre of the building ; be-
fides that, there ought to have been two deeples at the
ead end, to correfpond with thofe at the wed. On
entering this church, we indantly perceive an obvious
deficiency, not only of elevation but length, to aflid
the perfpe(5live; and the columns are heavy and clumfy,
rather encumbering the profpecl than enriching it.
St Paul’s occupies an area of fix acres, and is railed
all round with iron baludrades, each about five feet
and a half high, fixed on a dwarf wall of hewn
ftone. In the weft end of this area is a marble ftatue
of Queen Anne, holding a fceptre in one hand, and a

candle, and all necefiaries. And notice was given by the biflhop of London, to the pfeacher appointed by him, of
the place he was to repair to.
\\ e hear of this being in ufe as early as the year 1 259. It was ufed, as Mr Pennant obferves, not only for
the inftrudion of mankind by the doflnne of the preacher, but for every purpofe political or ecclefiaftical ; for
giving force to. oaths, for promulging of laws, or rather the royal plealure, for the emidion of papal bulls,
for anathematizing finners, for benedictions, for expofing of penitents under cenfure of the church, for recan¬
tations, for the private ends of the ambitious, and for the defaming of thofe who had incurred the difpleafure of
crowned heads.
It.was. demolithed in 1643 by order of parliament, executed by the willing hands of I fa ac-Pennington the
fanatical lord mayor of that year, who died in the Tower a conviCled regicide.

Surgeons, with a theatre for difleftion.
Adjoining to Chrift-church in Newgate-ftreet is
ChriJPs Hofpital, which, before the diffolution of mo-
nafteries by Henry VIII. was a houfe of Gray-friars.
The hofpital was founded by King Edward VI. for
fupporting and educating the fatherlefs children of
poor freemen of this city; of whom io©o of both
fexes are generally maintained in the houfe or out at
nurfe, and are likewife clothed and educated. In
1673, a mathematical fchool wras founded here by
Charles II. endowed with 320I. a-year*, and a w?rit-
ing fchool was added in 1694 by Sir John Moor, an
alderman of the city. After the boys have been feven
or eight years on the foundation, fome are Cent to the
univerfity and others to fea; while the reft, at a pro¬
per age, are put apprentices to trades at the charge of
the hofpital. At firft their habit was a ruffet cotton,
but was foon after changed for blue, which has ever
fince continued to be their colour *, and on this account
the foundation is frequently called the Blue-coat hofpital.
The affairs of this charity are managed by a prelident
and about 300 governors, befides the lord mayor and
aldermen. The fabric, which is partly Gothic and
partly modern, was much damaged by the fire of 1666,
but was foon repaired, and has been fince increafed
with feveral additions. The principal buildings, which
form the four fides of an area, have a piazza round them
with Gothic arches, and the w7alls are fupported by

In Farringdon ward without, is a large building
called Bridewell, from a fpring foim rly known by the
name of St Bridget’s or St Bride’s Well. It was ori¬
ginally a royal palace, and occupied all the ground
from Fleet-ditch on the eaft to Water-lane on the weft.
That part of it now called Saiifhury-court was given to
the biftiops of Salilbury for their town refidence *, and
the eaft part, which was rebuilt by King Henry VIII.
is the prefent Bridewell. It w*as granted to the citv
by Edward VI. as an hofpital; and he endowed it for
the lodging of poor travellers, and for the corredlion
of vagabonds, ftrumpets, and idle perfons, as well as
for finding them work. In one part of the building
20 artificers have houfes j and about 150 boys, di-

freedom of the city, with tol. towards carrying on
their refpeftive trades. The other part of Bridewell
is a receptacle for diforderly perfons, who are kept at
beating hemp and other hard labour.
Near Bridewell is St Bride's Church, a ftately fabric
in feet long, 57 broad, and 41 high, with a beautiful
fpire 234 feet in altitude, and haS a ring of 12 bells in

of which the centre one is 100 feet wide. The whole
length is 995 feet; the breadth of the carriage-way is
28 feet, and that of the two foot ways 7 each. Over
each pier is a recefs *, an apology for the beautiful

{liquid pay the fame fum annually for the relief of 100
lame and infirm patients. The endowments of this
charity have fince been fo much enlarged, that it now
receives the diftreffed of all denominations. In 1702,

Handing in a niche in full proportion, and thofe of two
cripples on the top of the pediment over it. In 1720,
a plan was formed for rebuilding the reft of this hoipi-
tal, in confequence ®f which a magnificent edifice has
been ere&ed.
Among many other privileges granted by Henry I.
to the prior and canons of the monaftery of St Bar¬
tholomew the Great, and to the poor of the infirmary,
was that of keeping a fair in Smithfield on the eve,
day, and morrow, of St Bartholomew. This fair,
called Bartholomew-fair, has been held annually ever
fince : and by the indulgence of the magiftrates of
London, to whom the privilege of keeping it devolved
upon the diflblution of the priory, it ufed to continue
a fortnight. A great number of booths was erefled
in it by the acfors of the theatres, for the exhibition
of dramatic performances of various kinds; and it be-
game at length a fcene of fo much licenticufneis and
riot, that Sir John Barnard when lord mayor of Lon¬
don reduced the time of the fair to its original dura¬
tion of three days. This laudable example has been
followed ever fince *, and the magiftrates have likewife
prohibited all public exhibitions which had been for¬
merly accompanied with fo much diforder.
In a ftreet in this wrard, called the Old Baiky, is a
hall named fujlice hall, or the Sejfiotfs hoife, where a
court is held eight times a-year by the king’s com-
miflion of oyer and terminer for the trial of criminals
for offences committed within the city of London and
county of Middlefex. The judges of this court are
the lord mayor, thofe of the aldermen that have ferved
that office, and the recorder 5 who are attended by the
ftieriffs and by one or more of the national judges.
In this ftreet is alfo the great criminal prifon, lately
built in a much more convenient fituation, and on a
more enlarged plan, than the former prifon, called
Newgate: by which name it is ftill diftinguilhed.
Here the unfortunate debtor will no longer be an¬
noyed by the dreadful rattle of chains, or by the more
horrid founds iffuing from the lips of thofe wretched
beings who fet defiance to all lavrs divine and human 5
and here alfo, the offender, whofe crime is not capital,
may enjoy all the benefits of a free open air.
In this ward is likewife a prifon called the Fleet
Prifon, from a fmall river named the Fleet which for¬
merly ran by it : this building is large, and reckoned
the belt in the city for good rooms and other conve-

niences. It has the benefit of a large yard, which is Lcndovi.
enclofed with a very high wall. This prilon is as an-' v~ ■“
cient as the reign of Richard I. and belongs to the
court of ehancery, &.c.
In Chancery-lane, in this ward, is, an office ccnfift-The Rolls,
ing of a houfe and chapel, called the othce and chapel
of the Rolls, from being' the great repofitory of the
modern public rolls and records of the kingdom. This
building was originally tbe lioufe of an eminent Jew j
but being forfeited to the crown, King Henry III. in
the year 1223 converted it into a hofpital for the
reception and accommodation of Jewifti and other pro-
lelytes. In 1377, Ldvtard III. granted this hofpital
and its chapel to William Burftall mafter of the rolls,
to whofe fucceffors in that office it has ever fince be¬
longed. Round this office there is a fmall diftrict
confiding of about 200 houfes, called the Liberty of
the Rolls, over which the magiftrates of London have
no authority, it being under the government of the
mafter of tbe rolls.
In this ward are feveral Inns of court and chancery,
particularly the Inner and Middle Temple, Serjeants
Inn, Clifford’s Inn, Barnard’s Inn, Staple’s Inn, and
Furnival’s Inn.
The T< triple received its name from being originally The Tem-
founded by the Knights Templars, who lettled here pie.
in 1185. It was at firft called the New Temple, to
diftinguifti it from the former houfe of the Knights
Templars, which flood in Holborn near Chancery
lane.
The original building was divided into three parts •,
the Inner, the Middle, and the Outer Temple. The
Inner and the Outer Temple were fo called, becaufe
one was within and the other was without the Bar-,
and the Middle derived its name from being fituated
between them. Upon the diffolution of the order of
K fights Templars, the New Temple devolved to the
K-iights Hofpitallers of St John of Jerufalem, who
granted a leafe of it to the ftudents of the common law,
and converted that part of it called Inner and Middle
Temple into txvo inns of court for the ftudy and prac¬
tice of the common lawn The Outer Temple became a
houfe for tbe earl of EPfex.
The buildings of tbe Temple efcaped the fire in
1666. but w*ere molt of them deftroyed by fubfeouent
fires, and have iince been rebuilt. The tw?o Temples
are each divided into feveral courts, and have pleafant
gardens on the banks of the Thames. They are ap¬
propriated to diftinft focieties, and have feparate halls,
where the members dine in common during term-time.
The Inner Temple hall is Lid to have been built in
the reign of Edward III. and the middle Temple hall,
which is a magnificent edifice, w-as rebuilt in T 972
in form of a college hall. The Middle Temple gate,
Mr Pennant informs us, was erected by Sir Annas
Powlet on a fingular occafion. It ieems that Sir A-
mias, about the year 1501 thought fit to put Cardi¬
nal Wolfey, then parfon of Lymington, into the flocks.
In 153 5, being fent for to London by the cardinal on
account of that ancient grudge, he was commanded
not to quit town till farther orders. In confequence,
he lodged five or fix years in this gatew ay, which he
rebuilt -, and to pacify his eminence, adorned the front
w’ith the cardinal’s cap, badges, cognifance, and other
devices of this butcher’s fon j fo low were the great

—v 1 Each temple has a good library, adorned with^ paint¬
ings, and well furnilhed with books. An aflembly,
called a parliament, in which the affairs of the fociety
of the Inner Temple are managed, is held there every
term. Both Temples have one church, firft founded
in nSy, by the Knights Templars; but the prefent
edifice is fuppofed to have been built in 1420. It is
fupported by neat (lender pillars of Suffex marble, and
is one of the moft beautiful Gothic flruflures in Eng¬
land. In this church are many monuments, particu¬
larly of nine Knights Templars cut in marble in full
proportion, Tome of them (even feet and a half long ;
fix are crofs-legged, and therefore fuppofed to have
been engaged in the crufades. The minifter of this
church, who is ufually called the majler of the Temple,
is appointed by the benchers or fenior members of both
focieties, and prefented by a patent from the crown.
Shakefpeare (whether from tradition or hiftory) makes
the Temple garden the place in which the badge of the
white and red rofe originated ; the diftinftive badge of
the houfes of York and Lancafler, under which the
refpedtive partizans of each arranged themfelves in the
fatal quarrel which caufed fuch torrents of Englifh
blood to flow.
Near the Temple bar is the Devil''s Tavern, fo called
from its fign of St Dunllan feizing the evil fpirit by
the nofe with a pair of hot tongs. Ben Johnfon has im¬
mortalized it by his Leges Conviviales, which he wrote
for the regulation of a club of wits held in a room he
dedicated to Apollo; over the chimney-piece of w’hich
they are preferved. The tavern was in his days kept
by Simon Wadloe ; whom, in a copy of verfes over the
door of the Apollo, he dignified wfith the title of King
of Skinhers.
Serjeants Inn is a fmall inn in Chancery-lane, where
the judges and ferjeants have chambers, but not houfes,
as they had in another inn of this name in Fleet-ftreet,
which they abandoned in 1730; but in each of them
there is a hall and a chapel. Clifford's Inn is an inn of
chancery belonging to the Inner Temple. It wras ori¬
ginally a houfe granted by Edward II. to the family
of the Cliffords, from which it derived its name ; but
wTas afterwards let upon leafe to the ftudents of the
law, and in the reign of Edward III. fold to the mem¬
bers of this fociety. Bernard's Inn is likewife an inn
of chancery belonging to Gray’s Inn. It Bands in
Holborn, and v/as the houfe of John Mackworth, dean
of Lincoln, w'ho gave it to the profeffors of the law.
Staple's Inn belongs alfo to Gray’s Inn, and is fituated
in Holborn. It was once a hall for the merchants of
the fbple for wool, whence it derives its name ; but it
was purchafed by the benchers of Gray’s Inn, and has
been an inn of chancery fince the year 1415. Fur-
nival's Inn is an inn of chancery belonging to Lincoln’s
Inn, and was once the houfe of the family of the Furni-
vals, by whom it w’as let out to the profeffors of the law.
It is a large old building,with a hall and a pleafant garden.
Bethlehem In Coleman-ftreet ward, on the fouth fide of a large
Hbfpital. fquare called Moorfelds, flood Bethlehem Hofpital, found¬
ed in 1675 by the lord mayor and citizens of London
for the reception and cure of poor lunatics. It was a
noble edifice, built with brick and Hone, and adorned
with pilaflers, entablatures, and fculpture ; particularly
with the figures of two lunatics over the grand gate,

which are well executed. This building was 543 feet
long and 40 broad, exclufive of two wings of a later v
eredlion, intended for the reception of fuch lunatics as
were deemed incurable. This hofpital contained a great
number of convenient cells or apartments, where the
patients wrere maintained and received all medical affifi>
ance without any other expence to their friends than
that of bedding. The ftruQure was divided into two
ftories, through each of which ran a long gallery from
one end of the houfe to the other. On the fouth fide
were the cells, and on the north the windows that -gave
light to the galleries, which wrere divided in the middle
by handfome iron gates, to keep the men and wminen
feparate. This hofpital being pulled down, it is intend¬
ed to ereft another building for the ufe of the fame
charity, a ta fliort diftance from the metropolis. Anew
road is to be opened from the fite of the old hofpital to
the Royal Exchange. 95
Oppofite to Bethlehem hofpital flood that of St St Luke’s
Luke, a long plain building, till of late appropriated to
the lame purpofes, but wholly independent of the for¬
mer. It was founded on the humane confideration
that Bethlehem was incapable of receiving all the mi-
ferable objedls which were offered. Of late years the
patients were removed from the old hofpital to a new
one erefled under the fame name in Old-llreet, on the
plan of the former, extending in front 492 feet. The
old hofpital is now pulled down, and replaced by a
handfome row of houfes. Uncured patients may be
taken in again, by a very liberal regulation, on the pay¬
ment of five (hillings a week; fo that their friends may,
if they choofe, try a fecond time the force of medicine
on their unhappy relations or acquaintances. 96
Befides the three markets already mentioned atDifferent
Smithfield for cattle and hay, at Leadenhall for but-mar^etl'
chers meat, wool, hides, and Colchefter baize, and
at Billingfgate for fifh; there are in this city the fol¬
lowing other markets, which are all very confiderable,
viz. Honey-lane, NewTgate, and Fleet-market, chiefly
for fielh, though with feparate divifions for fi(h, but-
ter, eggs, poultry, herbs, and fruit; and the Three-
Cranes market, for apples and other fruit. The princi¬
pal corn-market is held in a neat exchange fituated in
Market-lane, and that for flour at ()ueenhithe. In
Thames-ftreet, near Billingfgate, there is an exchange
for dealers in coals and mafters of veffels in that trade
to tranfaft their bufinefs. 97
II. The Borough of Sovtbjvark. It wras called by 2-B0rough
the Saxons Suth, or the “ South wTork,” in refpeft
to fome fort or fortification bearing that afpedt from junfdio
London. It was alfo called the Borough, or Burg, tiov,
probably from the fame reafon. It was long inde¬
pendent of the city of London : but, in confideration
of the inconveniences arifing from the efcape of ma-
lefaflors from the great capital into this place, it was
in 1327 granted by Edward III. to the city, cm pay¬
ment of 10I. annually. It was then called the village
of Southwark ; it was afterwards ftyled the bailiwick
of Southwark, and the mayor and commonalty of Lon¬
don appointed the bailiff. This power, however, not
being fufficient to remedy the evil, a more intimate
connexion was thought neceffary ; and in the reign of
Edward VI. on a valuable confideration paid to the
crown, it was formed into a 26th ward, by the title of
Bridge-Ward Without; with a refervation of certain

privileges enjoyed there by the archbifhop of Canter¬
bury and forr.e other ecclefiaftics. In confequence of
this, it was fubje&ed to the-lord mayor of London,
with the fteward and bailiff. But Southwark being
divided into two parts, this is to be underffood of the
divifion called the Borough Liberty, which confifts of
three of the parifhes belonging to the town, with the
greater part of a fourth parilh. For the city divifion,
the lord mayor by his fteward holds a court of record
every Monday at the feffions-houfe on St Margaret’s
Hill in this borough for all debts, damages, and tref-
paffes within the limits of his jurifdicHon. The other
divifion is called the Clink, or the Manor of Southwark,
and is fubdivided into the Great Liberty, the Guild¬
hall, and the King’s Manor ; for each of which fubdi-
vifions a court-leet is held, where the conftables, ale¬
conners, and flefh-tafters, are chofen, and other bufi-
nefs of this kind tranfadled. A court-houfe, called
Union Hall, has lately beea built in the new ftreet
called Union-Jlreet, which leads in a direfl: line from
the high-ftreet in the Borough to Great Surry-ftreet
Blackfriars road. The Clink liberty is under the ju-
nfdidlion of the bifhop of Winchefter, who, befides a
court-leet, keeps here a court of record on the Bank-
fide near St Saviour’s church by his fteward or bailiff,
for pleas of debt, damages, and trefpaffes. Court-
leets are alfo kept at Lambeth, Bermondfey, and Ro-
therhjthe, three fmall diftridls adjoining to the Borough.
—There is a compter for the imprifonment of offen¬
ders in the bailiw ick, and another for the Clink liberty ;
to which may be added the Surry workhoufe for va¬
grants. Befides thefe, there is the Marftialfea-prifon,
which is the county gaol for felons, and the admiralty
gaol for pirates (g) ; in which is a court firft eredled
for trials of caufes between the king’s domeftics or me¬
nial fervants, of which the knight-marlhal is prefident,
and his fteward judge, to wrhom belong four counfellors
and fix attorneys ; and the court is held every Friday
by him or his deputy, for debt, damages, and tref¬
paffes, in caufes for 10 miles round Whitehall, except¬
ing London. In this quarter is alfo the King’s Bench
prifon, the rules of which are above two miles in cir¬
cuit, and comprife the greateft part of St, George’s
Fields. Here was committed Henry prince of Wales,
afterwards King Henry V. by the fpirited and honeft
Judge Gafcoigne, for ftriking or infulting him on the
bench. In this prifon the allowance is fomewhat bet¬
ter than that of the common prifons j for which rea-
fon, many debtors remove themfelves hither by habeas
corpus. It is properly a place of confinement in all
cafes triable in the King’s Bench court.—The firft
time that Southwark is mentioned in hiftory is on oc-
cafion of Earl Goodwin’s failing up the river to at¬
tack the royal navy of 50 fhips lying before the palace
of Weftminfter : this was in 1052, when we are told
he went ad Suthweorce, and ftaid till there the re¬
turn of the tide.
Southwark confifts of the parithes of St Olave,

St Saviour, St George, and St Thomas ; the parifti of London.
Chrift-church, though contiguous to the borough, is' 
in the county of Surry.
The principal church in Southwark is ,that of St
Saviour, which was formerly a priory of regular ca¬
nons. Being dedicated to the Virgin Mary, and fi-
tuated near the bank of the Thames, it w’as called
St Mary Over Ree, or Overy, by which appellation it is
commonly known. This church is built in the man¬
ner of a cathedral, with three aifles from eaft to welt,
and a crofs aifle. It is reckoned the largeft parifti-
church in England, the three aides firft mentioned
meafuring 269 feet in length, and the crofs aide icp
feet. The height within is 47 feet, and it has a tower
with four fpires 150 feet high.
Not far from St George’s church flood the magni¬
ficent palace of Charles Brandon duke of Suffolk, the •
deferved favourite of Henry VIII. After his death, in
1345, it came into the king’s hands, who eljablidied
here a royal mint. It at that time was called South-
zvark P/ace, and in great meafure prelerved its dig¬
nity. Edward VI. once dined in it. His fifter and
fucceffor prefented it to Fleath archbidrop of York,
as an inn or refidence for him and his fucceffors when¬
ever they repaired to London. As to the Mint, it
became a fandluary for infolvent debtors -, but at length
becoming the pert of the neighbourhood, by giving
flicker to villains of every fpecies, that awakened the
attention of parliament; which by the ftatutes 8 and
9 Will. III. 9 George I. and 11 George I. entirely
took aw’ay its abufive privileges. IOI
In the pariflr of Chrift-church, near the water on Ancient
Bankfide, flood Paris-garden, one of the ancient play_ places of di-
houfes of our metropolis. Ben Johnfon is reproachedvcrll0n'
by one Decker, an envious critic, with his ill fuccefs
on the ftage, and in particular with having performed
the part of Zuliman at Paris-garden. It feems to
have been much frequented on Sundays. This pro¬
fanation (Mr Pennant obferves) w-as at length fully
punifhed by the dire accident which befel the fpedta-
tors in 1582, when the fcaffolding fuddenly fell, and
multitudes of people were killed or miferably maimed.
The omen feems to have been accepted; for in the
next century the manor of Paris-garden was ere£ted
into a parifti, and a church founded under the name of
Chrift’s.
Beyond this place of amufement were the Bear-gar¬
den and place for baiting of bulls, the Britijh circi;
“ Herein (fays Stow) were kept beares, bulls, and
other beafts to be bayted j as alfo maftives in feveral
kennels nourifhed to bayt them. Thefe beares and
other beafts are there kept in plots of ground fcaffolded
about for the beholders to ftand fafe.” This was then
an amufement for perfons of the firft rank : eur great,
if not good, Elizabeth caufed the French ambafiadors
to be carried to this theatre, to divert them with thefe
bloody fpe&acles. io5
Not far from thefe fcenes of cruel paftime was the The Stews,
Bordello
(g) In 1377 ppf°n was broken open by a mob of failors, who murdered a gentleman confined in it for
killing one of fheir comrades, and who had been pardoned by the court. It was again broken open by W at Tyler
and his followers in 1381. It efcaped in the infamous riots of 1780 , while the King’s Bench, the Borough Pri-
fon, and the Clink Prifon,^ were nearly at the fame inftant facrificed to their %y.

regulations, no ftewholder was to admit married wo¬
men y nor were they to keep open their houfes on Sun¬
days ; nor were they to admit any women who had on
them the perilous infirmity of burning. Thefe infamous
houfes wrere very properly fuppreffed in the reign of
Henry VIII.
The biihop of Winchefter had formerly a palace
here with a park (the fame that is now called Sout/i-
wark-fiark), which is fince converted into warehoufes
and tenements, held by leafe from the bilhops of that
103 lee.
St Thomas’s Befides feveral alms-houfes, there are here St Tho-
Hofpital. mas's and Guy's Hofpitals, two of the noblefl: endow¬
ments in England. The former was firft ere&ed in
1215 by Peter de Rupibus bilhop of Winchefter, who
endowed it with land to the amount of 343k a-year j
from which time it was held of the abbots of Bermond-
fey, one of whom in 1428 granted a right to the^mafter
of the hofpital to hold all the lands it was then in pof-
feflion of belonging to the faid abbot and convent, the
whole revenue of which did not exceed 266I. 17s*
per annum. In the year 155*» after the citizens of
London had purchafed of Edward VI. the manor of
Southwark and its appurtenances, of which this hof¬
pital was a part, they expended iiool. in repairing
and enlarging the edifice, and immediately received
into it 260 patients j upon which the king in 1553
incorporated this hofpital with thofe of Chrift-church
and Bridewell in the city of London. 1 he building
being much decayed, three beautiful fquares adorned
with colonnades were eretled by voluntary fubfeription
in 1693, to which in 1732 the governors added a mag¬
nificent building, confiding or feveral wards with pro¬
per offices. The annual dilhurfements of this hofpital
have for many years amounted to 8000I. Ihe houfe
is divided into 19 wards, and is faid to contain 474
beds.
Adjoining to St Thomas’s Hand Guy's Hofpital, per¬
haps the^moft extenfive charitable foundation that ever
was eftablilhed by one man in private life. The found¬
er of this hofpital was Thomas Guy, a bookfeller in
Lombard-ftreet, London, who lived to fee the edifice
roofed in ; and at his death, in 1724, left 238,292!.
16s. including the expence of the building, to finifti
and endow it. This hofpital confifts of two capacious
fquares, containing 12 wards and 435 beds. It was
incorporated by charter from parliament, and the firft
governors were appointed in 1725•
In St George’s Fields, weftward of the King’s Bench

“ The Hfylum is an inftitution of a moft heavenly

tion, induced a worthy band to found in the year
1758 the Afylum or Houfe of Refuge. Long may it
flounlh, and eternal be the reward of thofe into whofe
minds fo amiable a conception entered ! 106
“ To afford means of falvation to thofe unhappy'Tie Mag-
beings who had the ill fortune to lofe the benefits of Ho
this divine inftitution, the Magdalen Hofpital was infti- d
tuted for the reception of the penitent proftitutes. To
fave from vice, is one great merit. To reclaim and re-
ftore to the dignity of honeft rank in life, is certainly
not lefs meritorious. The joy at the return of one fin*
ner to repentance is efteemed by the higheft authority
worthy of the heavenly hoft. That eeftafy, I truft, this
inftitution has often occafioned. Since its foundation in
the fame year with the former, to December 25. 1786,
not fewer than 2471 have been admitted. Of thefe (it
is not to be wondered that long and evil habits are often
incurable) 300 have been difeharged, uneafy under con-
ftraint $ 45 proved lunatics, and afflifted with incurable

bounds of vice, fince the retreat from its paths is fo
difficult! Finally, J608 prodigals have been returned
to their rejoicing parents j or placed in reputable fer-
vices, or to honeft trades, banes to idlenefs and fecuri-
ties againft a future relapfe.” Into this charity, every

At Lambeth, the archbifhops of Canterbury have had
a palace. According to Mr Pennant, it was in the
earlier times a manor, poffibly a royal one : for the
great Hardiknut died here in 1042, in the midft of the
jollity of a wedding dinner •, and here, without any for¬
mality, the ufurper Harold is faid to have fnatched the
crown and placed it on his own head. At that period
it was part of the edate of Goda, wife to Walter earl
of Mantes, and Eufface earl of Boulogne; who pre-
lented it to the church of Rochefter, but referved to
herfelf the patronage of the church. It became in
j 197 the property of the fee of Canterbury, by ex¬
change tranfadfed between Glanville bifliop of Rochef-
ter and the archbilhop Hubert Walter. The building
was improved by Langton the fucceffor of Walter ; but
it was afterwards negledled and became ruinous. “ No
pious zeal (fays Mr Pennant) reflored the place, but
the madnefs of prieftly pride. Boniface, a wrathful and
turbulent primate, eledted in 1244, took it into his
head to become a vifitor of the priory of St Bartholo¬
mew, to which he had no right. The monks met him
with reverential refpedi, but affured him the office did
not belong to the bifhop. The meek prelate ruffied on
the fub-prior, knocked him down, kicked, beat, and
buffeted him, tore the cope off his back, and ftamped
on it like one poffeffed, while his attendants paid the
fame compliments to all the poor monks. The people
enraged at his unprieftly conduft wmuld have torn him
to pieces; when he retired to Lambeth, and, by way
of expiation, rebuilt it with great magnificence. At a
fubfequent period it was very highly improved by the
munificent Henry Chichely, who enjoyed the primacy
from 1414 to 4443. I lament to find fo wmrthy a man
to have been the founder of a building fo reproachful to
his memory as the Lollards tower, at the expence of
near 280I. Neither Proteftants or Catholics ffiould
omit vifiting this tower, the cruel prifon of the unhappy
follow'ers of Wickliffe. The vaft ftaples and rings to
which they T.vere chained before they were brought to
the flake, ought to make Proteflants blefs the hour
which freed them from fo bloody a religion.” During London.
the civil wars of the laid century* this palace fuffiered ' v" '
greatly ; but at the Refloration, the whole was repaired
by Archbiihop Juxton. IIO
The pariih church of Lambeth (h), which is at a and Church,
fmall difiance from the palace, has a plain tower; and
the architedlure is of the Gothic of the time of Ed¬
ward IV. It has very little remarkable in it, except
the figure of a pedlar and his dog, painted in one of
the windows; and tradition fays, that the parifh wras
obliged to this man for the bequefi of a piece of land,
which bears the name of the Ped/ar's )lcre. In the
churchyard is the tomb of old Tradefcant. Both father
an d fon were great travellers ; and the former is fuppo-
fed to have vifited Ruffia and moil parts of Europe,
Turkey, Greece, many of the eaftern countries, Egypt,
and Barbary ; out of which he introduced multitudes
of plants and flowers, unknown before in our gardens.
The monument is an altar tomb ; embellifhed with em¬
blematical fculptures ; and bearing the following in-
fcription, which is both Angular and hiilorical:

neath which thefe antiquities were found, are very rvell

are fed entirely on grains.
III. City and Liberties of Westminster. The city
of Wedminder derives its name from a minfter, or ab¬
bey, and wef, on account of its fituation with refpeft
to St Paul’s cathedral, which was formerly called Eajl-
minjler. In ancient times this didridl dood upwards of
a mile from the city of London, and contained only
two parhhes, which were thofe of St Margaret and St
John, with two chapels of eafe ; but at prefent it has
feven other parochial churches, viz. St Clement’s
Danes, St Paul’s Covent garden, St Mary’s le Strand,
St Martin’s in the Field’s, St Anne’s, St James’s, and
St George’s Hanover-fquare.
Wedminder was anciently called Thorny If and, from
its having been covered with thorn budies, and encom-
paffed by a branch of the Thames, which is faid to have
run through the ground now called St James's Park,
from wed to ead, and to have rejoined the river at
Whitehall.
Till the general diffolution of religious houfes, Wed-
minder was fubjefl to the arbitrary rule of its abbot and
monks; but in 1541, upon the furrender of Wil¬
liam Benfon the lad abbot, Henry VIII. not only
turned it into an honour, but created it the fee of a
bifhop, and appointed for a diocefe the whole coun¬
ty of Middlefex, except Fulham, which belonged
to the bhhop of London. This bifhoprick, how¬
ever, foon after its inditution, was diiiblved by Ed¬
ward VI.
The city of Wedminder is governed by a high
deward, an office of great dignity, who is ufually one London,
of the fird peers in the realm ; and is chofen for life ' v"
by the dean and chapter of the collegiate church of
St Peter. There is alfo a deputy dewajrd and a high
bailiff, wrho alfo hold their offices for life \ being no¬
minated by the dean and chapter, and confirmed by
the high deward.
The dean and chapter are inveded with an ecclefiaf-
tical and civil jurifdiclion within the liberties of Wed¬
minder, St Martin’s le Grand, near Cheapfide, in the
city of London, and fome towns in Effex, which are
exempted from the jurifdiftion of the biffiop of London
and the archbiffiop of Canterbury. u-
St Margaret's Church was founded by Edward the Churches.
Confeffbr, fince which time it has been frequently re¬
built. In the ead end of this church is a window cu-
rioudy painted, with the hidory of the crucifixion,
and with the figures of feveral apodles and faints finely
executed. It formerly belonged to a private chapel at
Copt-hall, near Epping in Eflex, and was purchafed
by the officers of this pariih, fome years ago for 400
guineas. In this church the houfe of commons attends
divine fervice on date holidays.
The church of St John the Evangelif was erefled in
1728, and having funk confiderably whild it was build¬
ing, occafioned an alteration of the plan. On the north
and fouth fides are magnificent porticoes, fupported by
vad done pillars, as is alfo the roof of the church ; at
each of the four corners is a beautiful done tower and
pinnacle, which were added with the view of making
the whole dnnffure fink equally. The parts of this
building are held together by iron bars, which run
acrofs even the aides. II(j
The mod remarkable dru£lure in Wedminder is the Weftmin-
abbey-church of St Peter. On its fite 'dood once a ^er Abbey,
temple of Apollo, which according to tradition was ^
thrown down by an earthquake in the time of Antoni- 1
nus Pius •, and from the ruins of which Sebert king of
the Wed Saxons raifed a Chriffian church, which was
ruined by the Danes. It was repaired by Edward the
Confeffbr, and given to a few monks; and this fpot he
chofeLor his burial-place. Henry III. 160 years after,
took down this fabric of Edward’s, and eredled a new
church, which was 50 years in building. It fuffered
much by fire in 1274, but was repaired by Edward I.
Edward II. and the abbots. In 1700 this church being
much decayed, the parliament granted money for re¬
pairing it, and has frequently repeated the bounty fince
that time. The form of the abbey is that of a long
crofs :
Frontiniac, to the more elegant tables ; the Madeira, the Calcavella, and the Lifbon, into every part of the
kingdom.”
(l) “ There is a magnificence of bufinefs (our author remarks) in this ocean of fweets and fours that cannot
fail exciting the greateft admiration ; whether we confider the number of veflels or their fize. The boafted tun
at Heidelberg does not furpafs them. On firft entering the yard,, two rife before you, covered at the top with a
thatched dome ; between them is a circu’ar turret, including a winding ftaircafe, which brings you to their fum-
mits, which are above 24 feet in diarrieter. One of thefe confervatories is full of fweet wine, and contains
,-8,109 gallons, or 1811; barrels of Winchefter meafure. Its fuperb affbciate is full of vinegar, to the amount of
56,799 s?al]ons> or 1774 barrels of the fame ffandard as the former. The famous German veflel yields even to
the laff by the quantity of 40 barrels.—Befides thefe, is an avenue of leffer veflels, which hold from 32,500 to
16,974 gallons each. After quittinor this Brobdignagian fcene, we pafs to the acres covered with common bar¬

' of the weft front 66 feet $ the length of the crofs aille
is 1 89 feet, and the height of the roof 92 feet. At
the weft end are two towers : the nave and crofs aide
are fupported by 50 (lender pillars of Suffex marble, ex-
clufive of pilafters. In the upper and lowTer ranges
there are 94 wdndows, all which, with the arches, roofs,
and doors, are in the Gothic tafte. The hftide of this
church is much better executed than the outfide : and
the perfpeftive is good, particularly that of the grand
aide. The choir, from which there is an afcent by fe-
veral fteps to a fine altar-piece, is paved with black and
white marble 5 having 28 (tails on the north, the fame
number on the fouth, and eight at the weft end. The
altar is made of a beautiful piece of marble, the gift
of Queen Anne, enclofed by a curious baluftrau^ and
upon a pavement of porphyry, jafper, Lydian, and
ferpentine (tones, laid in the mofaic (tyle, at the ex¬
pence of Abbot Ware, A. D. 1272 j and is faid to be
one of the melt beautiful of its kind in the world.
On each fide of this altar a door opens into St Ed¬
ward’s chapel ; round w'hich are 10 other chapels,
ranging from the north to the fouth crofs aides, and
are dedicated, 1. To St Andrew. 2. To St Michael.
3. To St John Evangelift. 4. Idip’s chapel. 5. To
St John Baptift. 6. To St Paul. 7. Henry V.’s cha¬
pel. 8. To St Nicholas. 9. To St Edmund. 10. To
St Benedhft.
In St Edward’s chapel are (till to be feen the remains
of his (hrine •, which, though now in obfeurity, and
robbed of all its riches and luftre, wTas once efteemed
the glory of England, fo far as art and riches could
make it. Here are the tombs of King Edward I. and
feveral other kings and queens of England j and here
alfo is drown the famous chair in which the kings of
Scotland ufed to be crowned at Scoone. Henry V.’s
chapel is divided from St Edward’s by an iron fereen,
on each fide of which are ftatues as big as life.—St
Andrew’s chapel, which is next the north crofs, and
the others which furround the choir, are crowded with
the monuments of noble perfonages, wrorthy the atten¬
tion of the curious.—At the corner of St Benedift’s
chapel, an iron gate opens into the fouth crofs aide;
which from the number of monuments eredfted therein
to celebrated Englidr poets, has obtained the name of
the Poets corner: though here we find a moft magnifi¬
cent monument erefled at the fouth end in memory of
the late John duke of Argyle and Greenwich ; another
to William Camden the antiquarian ; and others to
the celebrated divine Dr Ifaac Barrow, to Thomas
Parr who died at the age of 152 years, &c.—The
fouth aide is adorned with 19 curious monuments of the
pious, the brave, and the learned ; and turning north¬
ward from the weft door, wre view a great number
more.
On the eaft of the abbey, and which, though fepa-
rate from the other chapels in the choir, feems to be
one and the fame building with the abbey, (lands the
chapel of King Henry VII. which that king founded
in the year 1502, and was at that time ftyled the won-
der of the world, and is now one of the moft expenfive
remains of the ancient Englifh tafte and magnificence.
There is no looking upon it without admiration : it
conveys an idea of the fine tafte of Gothic architec-
,ture in that age; and the infide is fo noble, majeftic,
6 1 LON
and of fuch curious workmanlhip, that it would take London,
a volume to deferibe each part with juftice and pro- 1
priety.
Its original intention was to be a dormitory for the
royal blood : and fo far the will of the founder has
been obferved, that none have been interred therein
but fuch as have traced their defeent from ancient
kings. The tomb of King Henry VIE is moft magni¬
ficent, enclofed with a fereen of cart brafs, moft admi¬
rably defigned, and as well executed. Within the rails
are the figures of that king and his royal confort, in
their robes of (late, on a tomb of black marble : and
at the head of this tomb lie the remains of Edward VI.
In different parts of this chapel are the monuments of
Lewis Stuart duke of Richmond, George Villars duke
of Buckingham, John Sheffield duke of Buckingham,
Charles Montague marquis of Halifax, Edward V. and
his brother Richard ; the vault of James I. and his
queen Anne and daughter Mary, on which is a fmall
tomb adorned with the figure of a child ; a lofty mo¬
nument of Queen Elizabeth, and another of Mary
queen of Scots; the monuments for Margaret Douglas
daughter of Margaret queen of Scots, Margaret coun-
tefs of Richmond mother to Henry VII. the vault of
King Charles II. and William III. Queen Mary his
confort, Queen Anne, and Prince George. Over thefe
royal perfonages are their effigies (except that of
Prince George) in wainfeot preffes, made of w’ax-to
referable life, and dreffed in their coronation robes.
And at the corner of the great eaft window, in another
wainfeot prefs, (lands the effigy of Mary duchefs of
Richmond, daughter to James duke of Richmond and
Lenox, dreffed in the very robes (lie wore at the coro¬
nation of Queen Anne. On leaving the aide, you are
(hown another prefs, containing the effigy of General
Monk, who, on account of his loyalty, and the part
he took in the reftoration of King Charles II. had a
vault appropriated to him and his family amongft the
royal blood.
In a fine vault under Henry the VII.’s chapel, is
the burying place of the prefent royal family, erefted
by his late majefty King George II. Adjoining to
the abbey are the cloifters, built in a quadrangular
form, with piazzas towards the court, where feveral of
the prebendaries have their houfes. IlS
Near the abbey church is the King’s fchool, ufually Weftmin-
called Wejlminfer fchool. It was originally founded in fter School.
1070, and a fecond time by Queen Elizabeth in 1560,
whence it is fometimes called the Queen's College; and
is at prefent one of the greateft fchools in the king¬
dom. The learned antiquary Mr Camden wras once
mailer of it, and Ben Johnfon one of his fcholars.
Dr Bufby, who was mailer upwards of 50 years,
greatly contributed to keep up its reputation, formed
its mufeum, and improved both the mafter’s and his
prebendal houfe.—This fchool, inftead of one mailer
and one uffier as at firll, has now an upper and under
mafter, and five uftrers, who have about 400 youths
under their tuition. A plan was fet on foot when the
prefent archbilhop of York was mafter, for building
a college for the ufe of the ftudents, but this did not

London, wards rebuilt by Richard II. in the year 1397. It
—* ’ is reckoned one of the largeft rooms in Europe, being
200 feet long, 70 broad, and 90 high, fupported
only by buttreffes. The roof is of timber, and was
fome years ago Hated, the old covering of lead being
reckoned too heavy. It is paved with Hone. In this
fpacious room the kings of England have generally
held their coronation and other folemn feafts j and it
is ufed for the trial of peers. Since the reign of
Henry III. the three great courts of Chancery, King’s
Bench, and Common Pleas, have been held in feparate
apartments of this hall j and the court of Exchequer
above flairs.
Adjoining to the fouth-eafl angle of Weflminfler-
hall is a building formerly called St Stephen's Chapel,
from its having been dedicated to that faint. It was
founded by King Stephen j and in 1347 was rebuilt
by King Edward III. who converted it to a collegiate
church ; but fmce it was furrendered to Edwrard VI.
it has been ufed for the aflembly of the reprefentatives
of the commons of England, and is now generally
called the Houfe of Commons. The benches, which
afcend behind one another as in a theatre, are covered
with green cloth ; the floor is matted j and round the
room are wainfcot galleries, fupported by cantilevers
adorned with carved w'ork, in which flrangers are often
permitted to fit and hear the debates.
On the fouth fide of the hall is the Houfe of Lords,
fo called from being the place where the peers of
Great Britain affemble in parliament. It is an oblong
room, not quite fo large as the houfe of commons $
and is hung w’ith fine old tapeflry, reprefenting the
defeat of the Spanifh Armada in 1588. The defign
was drawn by Cornelius Vroom, and the tapefiry exe¬
cuted by Francis Spiering. It was not put up till
the year 1650, two years after the extinflion of mo¬
narchy, when the houfe of lords was ufed as a com¬
mittee room for the houfe of commons. The heads
of the naval heroes who commanded on the glorious
day form a matchlefs border round the work, animat¬
ing poflerity to emulate their illuflrious example.
Here is a throne for the king, with feats on the right
and left for fuch peers of the realm as are of the
blood royal. Before the throne are three broad feats j
on the firft of which, next the throne, fits the lord
chancellor, or keeper of the great feal, who is fpeaker
of the houfe of peers ; and on the other twro fit the
judges, the mafter of the rolls, or the mailers in chan¬
cery, who attend occafionally to give their opinions on
points of law. The two archbifhops fit at fome di¬
ll ance from the throne on the right hand, and the
other bilhops in a row under them. All the benches
are covered with red cloth fluffed with w7ool. Plere
likewife, by an order of the houfe, a gallery for flran¬
gers has been eredled.
Adjoining to the houfe of lords is the Prince's
Chamber, where the king is robed when he comes to
the parliament. On the other fide is the Painted
Chamber, which is faid to have been Edward the Con-
feffor’s bedchamber, and the room in which the par¬
liaments were anciently opened. Here conferences
are often held between the two houfes, or their com¬
mittees. Contiguous to thofe is an apartment called

Near thefe buildings is a bridge over the Thames, London,
called Weflminfler Bridge, accounted one of the molt
complete and elegant flrudlures of the kind in
known world. It is built entirely of Hone, and ex- fteTbndge,
tends over the river at a place where it is 1223 feet
broad: which is above 380 feet broader than at Lon¬
don bridge. On each fide is a fine baluflrade of
flone, with places of fhelter from the rain. The width
of the bridge is 44 feet, having on each fide a fine
foot way for paffengers. It confifls of 14 piers, and
13 large and two fmall arches, all femicircular, that
in the centre being 76 feet wide, and the reft decreaf-
ing four feet each from the other, fo that the two
leaft arches of the 13 great ones are each 52 feet.
It is computed that the value of 40,000!. in Hone
and other materials is always under wTater. This
magnificent ftru£lure was begun in 1739, and finiftied
in 1750, at the expence of 389,000!. defrayed by the
parliament. It was built after the defign of M. Labelye,
an ingenious architect, a native of France. r2^
On the bank of the Thames, at the eaft confines of Whitehall.
St Margaret’s parifh, was a palace called Whitehall,
originally built by Hubert de Burgh earl of Kent, be¬
fore the middle of the 13th century. It afterwards
devolved to the archbiftiop of York, whence it receiv¬
ed the name of 'York Place, and continued to be the
city refidence of the archbiihops till it was purchafed
by Henry VIII. of Cardinal Wolfey in 1530. At
this period it became the refidence of the court ; but
in 1697 was deftroyed by accidental fire, all except
the Banqueting-houfe, which had been added to the
palace of Whitehall by James I. according to a defign
of Inigo Jones. This is an elegant and magnificent
ftruflure of hewn ftone, adorned with an upper and
lower range of pillars, of the Ionic and Compofite or¬
ders j the capitals are enriched with fruit and foliages,
and between the columns of the windows. The roof
is covered with lead, and furrounded with a baluftrade.
The building chiefly confifts of one room of an oblong
form 40 feet high, and a proportionable length and
breadth. The cieling is painted by the celebrated Sir
Peter Paul Rubens. It is now ufed only as a chapel-
royal, and the other part of the houfe is occupied with
with ftate offices. I2^
Oppofite to the Banqueting-houfe ftands the HorfeHoxk
Guards, fo called from being the ftation where that
part of his majefty’s troops ufually do duty. It is a
ftrong building, of hewm ftone, confiding of a centre
and two wings. In the former is an arched paffage
into St James’s Park *, and over it, in the middle, rifes
a cupola. In a part of the building is the War Office.
Near the Horfe-guards is the Treafury ; a large build¬
ing, which fronts the Parade in St James’s park j and
where the board of treafury is kept. 126
Eaftward of the Horfe Guards is the Admiralty Office,
a large pile, built wdth brick and ftone. The front Ce'
towards Whitehall has two deep wdngs, and a lofty
portico fupported by four large ftone pillars. A
piazza, confiding of beautiful columns, runs almofl:
from one end to the other. The wall before the court
has been lately built in an elegant manner, and each
fide of the gate is ornamented with naval emblems.

it was built. The crofs remained till the civil wars in
the reign of Charles I. when it was deftroyed by the

after the Refloration, an equeftrian llatue of Charles I.
wras fet up in its dead. This, which is of brafs, and
finely executed, continues to be an ornament to the
place. It was made in 1633, at the expence of the
Howard-Arundel family. The parliament fold it to a
brazier in Holborn, with drift orders to break it to
pieces •, but he concealed it under ground till the Re-
doration, when it was fet up in 1678.
At the wed end of the Mall, in St James’s park,
which begins near Charing-crofs, dands the ^ueeti’s
Palace. It was originally knowm by the name of Ar¬
lington Hon/e ; but being purchafed by the late duke of
Buckingham’s father, who rebuilt it from the ground
in 1703, it was called Buckingham Houfe, till the year
1762, when it wras purchafed by his majedy for a
royal refidence. It is built of brick and done, having
in the front two ranges of piladers of the Corinthian
and Tufcan orders. It has a fpacious court yard, en-
clofed with iron rails, fronting St James’s park, with
offices on each fide, with two pavilions, feparated from
the manfion houfe by colonnades of the Tufcan, Do¬
ric, and Ionic orders. His majedy has here built a
fine library, in an oftagonal form, befides feveral other
additions.
Eadwards of the queen’s palace dands St James's,
an old building, which, till the former was purchafed
by the crown, had been the town refidence of the roy¬
al family fince the burning of Whitehall in 1697.
This palace was built by Henry VIII. and obtained
its name from an hofpital which formerly dood on the
fpot. It is an irregular building, of a mean appearance
without, but contains feveral magnificent apartments.
Here the court and levees are dill kept, and mod of
the perfons belonging to the houfehold have their re-
fiience. The chapel of the hofpital was converted to
the ufe of the royal family, as it now remains, and is
a royal peculiar, exempted from all epifcopal jurifdic-
tion. When this palace was built, it abutted in the
fouth-wTed upon an uncultivated fwampy traft of
ground, which the king enclofed and converted into
a park, called from the palace St James's park. He
alfo laid it out into walks, and collefted the wrater into
one body. It was afterwards much enlarged and im¬
proved by King Charles II. who planted it with lime
trees, and formed a beautiful vida, near half a mile in
length, called the Mall, from its being adapted to a
play at bowds didinguifhed by that name. He alfo
formed the wrater into a canal 100 feet broad and
2800 feet long *, and furniffied the park with a decoy,
and other ponds for water-fowd ; but thefe have lately
been dedroyed, on account of the unwholefome vapours
which they excited.
In a line with St James’s palace, on the ead fide,
is Marlborough-houfe, "which belongs to the duke of
Marlborough, and is a large brick edifice, ornamented

year 1353 the whole of it was an open high way, with London,
gardens to the water-fide. In that year it was fo
ruinous, that Edward III. by an ordinance direfted a
tax to be railed upon wool, leather, wine, and goods
carried to the daple at Wellminder, from Temple-bar
to Wedminder abbey, for the repair of the road •, and
that all owners of houfes adjacent to the high way
fhould repair as much as lay before their doors.
Before the above period, it entirely cut off Wedmin¬
der from London ; nothing intervened except the
fcattered houfes, and a village which afterwards gave
name to the whole 5 and St Martin’s dood literally in
the fields. But about the year 1560 a dreet wTas form¬
ed, loofely built •, for all the houfes on the fouth fide
had great gardens to the river, were called by their
owners names, and in after-times gave name to the
feveral dreets that fucceeded them, pointing down to
the Thames •, each of them had dairs for the con-
veniency of taking boat, of which many to this day
bear the names of the houfes. As the court was for
centuries either at the palace of Wedminder or White¬
hall, a boat wras the cudomary conveyance of the great
to the prefence of their fovereign. The north fide
w’as a mere line of houfes from Charing-crofs to
Temple-bar ; all beyond was country. The gardens
which occupied part of the fite of Covent-garden w^ere
bounded by fields, and St Giles’s was a didant country
village. Our capital found itfelf fo fecure in the vigo¬
rous government of Queen Elizabeth, that, by the
year 1600, mod confiderable additions were made .to
the north of the long line of dreet jud deferibed. St
Martin’s-lane was built on both fides. St Giles’s
church was dill infulated : but Broad-dreet and Hol¬
born wyere completely formed into dreets with houfes
all the way to Snow-hill. Covent-garden and Lin-
coln’s-inn-fields w-ere built, but in an irregular manner.

Almod contiguous to Charing-crofs, and upon the Northuia-
fouth fide of the Strand, is that noble palace called berland
Northumberland Houfe, which dands on the fite 0f ^ou^e'
the hofpital of St Mary Rounceval. Henry VIII.
granted it to Sir Thomas Caverden. It wras after¬
wards transferred to Henry Howard earl of Northamp¬
ton 5 wrho, in the time of James I. built here a houfe,
and called it after his own name. He left it to his
kinfman the earl of Suffolk, lord treafurer : and by the
marriage of Algernon Percy earl of Northumber¬
land, w’ith Elizabeth daughter of Theophilus earl of
Suffolk, it paffed into the houfe of the prefent noble
owmer. The greater part of the houfe w7as built by
Bernard Janfen, an architeft in the reign of James I.
The front next the dreet was begun by Algernon in
1748, and finiffied by the prefent duke, who married
his daughter. Two additional wings to the front next
the Thames, and a variety of other improvements both
in building and furniture, have contributed to render
this houfe the larged and mod magnificent in London.
It contains a gallery of 106 feet long by 26 wide, mod

the challengers of England, who had caufed to be
proclaimed, in France, Flanders, Scotland, and Spain,
a great and triumphant jufting to be holden at Weft-
minfter, for all comers that would undertake them.
But both the challengers and defendants were Eng-
liih. After the gallant fports of each day, the chal¬
lengers rode into this Durham-houle where they kept
open houfehold, and feafted the king and queen (Anne
of Cleves) with her ladies, and all the court. In the
reign of Edward VI. the Mint was eftablhhed in this
houfe, under the management of Sir William Shar-
rington, and the influence of the afpiring Thomas
Seymour, lord admiral. Durham-houfe was reckon¬
ed one of the royal palaces belonging to C^ueen Eliza¬
beth •, who gave the ufe of it to the great Sir Walter
Raleigh.
Durham-yard is now filled with a moft magnificent
mafs of building, called the Adelplu, in honour of two
brothers, the ingenious Adams, its archite&s. Be-
fides its fine lodgings, it is celebrated for its enchant¬
ing profpeff, the utility of its wdiarfs, and its fubter-
raneous apartments anfwering a variety of purpofes of
general benefit.
Farther on Hand the ruins of the Savoy. Henry III.
had granted to Peter of Savoy, uncle to his queen
Eleanor, daughter of Berringer of Provence, all the
houfes upon the Thames w’here this building now
Hands, to hold to him and his heirs, yielding yearly
at the Exchequer three barbed arrows for all fervices.
This prince founded the Savoy, and bellowed it on
the foreign hofpital of Montjoy. Queen Eleanor pur-
ehafed it, and bellowed it on her fon Edmund earl
of Lancafter. It was rebuilt in a moll magnificent
manner by his fon Henry. It was made the place of
confinement of John king of France in >356, after
he was taken prifoner at the battle of Poitiers. In
1381 it was entirely dellroyed by Wat Tyler, out of
fpleen to the great owner John of Gaunt. Henry VII.
began to rebuild it, with a defign of forming it into
an hofpital for a hundred diltreffed people, and Hen¬
ry VIII. completed the defign. The revenues, at the
fupprellion by Edward VI. amounted to above 500^-
a-year. Queen Mary rellored it 5 and her maids of
honour, with exemplary piety, furnifhed it with all ne-
ceffaries. It w7as again lupprelfed by Queen Elizabeth ;
and at prefent part ferves as lodgings for private people,
for barracks, and a fcandalous infedtious prifon for
the foldiery and for tranfport-convi&s.
A little to the eallward Hood Somerfet Houfe, a pa¬
lace built by Somerfet the proteftor in the time of
Edward VI.; and to make way for which he demo-
lithed a great number of buildings without making any
recompenfe to the owners. Part of the church of St
John of Jerufalem and the Tower were blown up for
the fake of the materials •, and the cloiIters on the north
fide of St Paul’s, with the charnel-houfe and chapel,

and fculptors. The terrace on the fouth fide is a walk

The church of St Martin is diflinguilhed by the *
name of St Martin's in the Fields, from its fituation, ciuirches.
which was formerly a field, with only a few fcattered
houfes. The church being decayed, was rebuilt by
Henry VIII. and again by James I. but not being
large enough to accommodate the inhabitants of the
parilh, it was augmented in 1607, at t^ie charge of
Prince Henry, eldelt fon of James I. and feveral of
the nobility. After many expenfive reparations, how¬
ever, it was entirely taken down in 1720, and a
new church begun, which was finilhed in 1726. This
is an elegant edifice, built of Hone. On the weft
front is a noble portico of Corinthian columns, fup-
porting a pediment, in which are repreiented the royal
arms in bas relief. The afeent to the portico is by a
flight of very long Heps. The length of this church
is about 140 feet, the breadth 60, and height 45. It
has a fine arched roof fuftained by Itone columns of
the Corinthian order. The fteeple has a beautiful
fpire, and one of the bell rings of bells in London.
St James's Church was built in the reign of Charles
II. at the expence of Henry earl of St Alban’s, and
other neighbouring inhabitants. The building is of
brick and Hone, about 85 feet long, 60 broad, and
45 feet high, with a handfome fteeple 150 feet in
height.
St George's Church, near Hanover-fquare, is a beau¬
tiful ftruclure. This was one of the fifty new churches
eredted within the reign of Queen Anne. The ground
for the edifice was given by the late Lieutenant-general
Stewart, who alfo left 4000I. to the pariih, towards
erecting and endowing a charity fchool \ which, by
additional benefadlions and fubicriptions, is become
very confiderable.
The greater part of the parifti of SV Paul's Covent-
garden, was anciently a garden, belonging to the ab¬
bot and convent of Weftminfter, and was then called
Convent-garden, a name corrupted into Covent, and 13S
more generally Common-garden. In 1552, Edward VI.
gave it to the earl of Bedford, with an adjoining field,
formerly called the Seven Acres, but now, being turned
into a long llreet, called Long-acre. The church of
St Paul’s, Covent-garden, was built by Inigo Jones,
and was efteemed one of the moll Ample and perfect
pieces of architecture in England. It was burnt by
accident a few years ago •, but has fince been rebuilt in

It is difiinguiftied from all the reft by Handing fouth

In Lamb’s Conduit-fields, on the north fide of the
town, is a large and commodious ftru&ure called the
Foundling Hofpital, for the reception of expofed and
deferted children. This laudable charity was project¬
ed by feveral eminent merchants in the reign of Queen
Anne but was not carried into execution till many
years afterwards, when a charter for its eftablifhment
was obtained, through the indefatigable afliduity of
Mr Thomas Coram, the commander of a merchant
vefiel, who fpent the remainder of his life in promoting
this defign. From the time of its inftitution, the par¬
liament has occafionally granted confiderable fums for
its fupport 5 and in fome years upwards of 6900 infants
have been received.
Not far from hence is an Hofpital for the Smallpox;
and in different parts of the town there are others, either
for the fick of all kinds, or thofe in particular circum-
ftances. Of the latter are feveral Lying-in hofpitals,
and the Loch Hofpital for female patients in the venereal
difeafe. Of the former are St George's and Middlefex
Hofpitals, befides feveral infirmaries.
Gray's Inn is one of the four principal inns of court;
which, though fituated within the limits of the pariih
of St Andrew, Holborn, is yet without the liberties
of the city of London. It took its name from an
ancient family of the name of Gray, which formerly
refided here, and in the reign of Edward III. demifed

Richmond in Surry, who leafed it to the fociety of v—
the Inn. It was held by this tenure till the diffolution
of the monafteries, when Henry VIII. granted it to
the fociety in fee-farm. This inn confifts chiefly of
two quadrangles, and has an old hall well built of tim¬
ber, with a chapel in the Gothic ftyle. Here is alfo a
good library, and the inn is accommodated with a fpa-
cious garden.
Lincoln's Inn, another of the four principal inns of Lincoln'*
court, was originally the palace of Ralph Neville bilhoplnn.
of Chichefter, and chancellor of England about the
year 1226. It afterwards devolved to the earl of Lin¬
coln, who converted it into a court for the ftudents of
law about the year 1310. From him it received the
name of Lincoln's Inn, and confifted only of what is
now called the old fquare, which is entered from Chan¬
cery-lane. At prefent this fquare contains, befides
buildings for the lawyers, a large hall where the lord
chancellor hears caufes in the fittings after term. To
this inn belongs likewife a fine garden, which has late¬
ly been diminiihed by the building of fome large and
commodious offices, for the ufe of the fix clerks in the

the word chartreux, a name formerly ufed for a con¬
vent or priory of the Carthufians, which this place
formerly was. After the diffolution of monafteries it
fell to the earl of Suffolk, who difpofed of it to Tho¬
mas Sutton, Efq. a citizen of London, in the time of
King James I. for 13,000!. The purchafer intend¬
ing it for an hofpital, applied to the king for a patent,
which he obtained in i6n,and the grant was con¬
firmed by parliament in 1623. Sutton having ex¬
pended 7000I. in fitting up the buildings, gave ifc
the name of King James's Hofpital, and endowed it
with lands to the amount of near 4500I. a-year, for
the maintenance of 80 gentlemen, merchants or fol-
diers, wffio ffiould be reduced to indigent circumftances ;
and 40 boys, to be inftrufted in claflical learning. The
men are provided with handfome apartments, and all
the neceffaries of life except clothes; inftead of which
each of them is allowed a gown, and 7I. a-year. Of
the boys, 29 are at a proper time fent to the univer-
lity, where each has an allowance of 20I. a-year for
eight years. Others, who are judged more fit for
trade, are put out apprentices, and the fum of 40I.
is given with each of them. As a farther encourage¬
ment to the fcholars, there are nine ecclefiaftical pre¬
ferments in the gift of the governors. It is alfo by
the recommendation of the latter that all penlioners
and youths are received into the hofpital. They corr-
fift of 16, of which number the king is always one, and
the others are generally noblemen of the firft rank. To
this hofpital belong a mafter, a preacher, two fchool-
mafters, a phyfician, a regifter, a receiver, a treafurer,
a ftewrard, an auditor, and other officers; and the an¬
nual revenues of it being now increafed to upwards of

Before the conflagration in 1666, London (which b°ndon

gmnmgs) was totally inelegant, inconvenient, and rin-eIlt an(i un^,
healthy, of which latter misfortune many melancholy healthy,
proofs are authenticated in hiftory, and which, with¬
out doubt, proceeded from the narrownefs of the
ftreets, and the unaccountable proje&ions of the build¬
ings, that confined the putrid air, and joined with
other circumftances, fuch as the want of water, ren¬
dered the city feldom free from peftilential devaftation.
The fire which confumed the greateft part of the
city, dreadful as it was to the inhabitants at that time,
was productive of confequences which made ample
amends for the lofles fuftained by individuals ; a new
city arofe on the ruins of the old 5 but, though more
regular, open, convenient, and healthful, than the
former, yet it by no means anfwered to the characters
of magnificence or elegance, in many particulars ; and
it is ever to be lamented (fuch was the infatuation of
thofe times), that the magnificent, elegant, and ufefui
plan of the great Sir Chriftopher Wren, was totally
difregarded, and facrificed to the mean and felfifla
views of private property 5 views which did irreparable
injury to the citizens themfelves and to the nation in

Nothing can appear more brilliant than thofe lights

Wealth and London, then, in its large fenfe, including Weft-
grandeur of minder, Southwark, and part of Middlefex, forms
one great metropolis, of vaft extent and of prodi¬
gious w’ealth. When conlidered with all its advan¬
tages, it is nowT what ancient Rome once was ; the
feat of liberty, the enccurager of arts, and the admi¬
ration of the whole world. It is the centre of trade ;
h-as an intimate connexion with all the counties in the
kingdom ; and is the grand mart of the nation, to
which ail parts fend their commodities, from whence
they are again fent back into every town in the nation
and to every part of the world. From hence innumer¬
able carriages by land and w’ater are conflantly em¬
ployed : and from hence arifes that circulation in the
rational body which renders every part healthful, vigo¬
rous, and in a profperous condition ; a circulation that
is equally beneficial to the head and the moft diftant
members. Merchants are here as rich as noblemen ;
witnefs their incredible loans to government : and
there is no place in the world where the ihops of tradef-
men make fuch a noble and elegant appearance, or are
lc.2 better ftocked.
Its excellent The Thames, on the banks of which London is ft-
fituation tuated, is a river which, though not the largeft, is
the richeft and moft commodious for commerce of any
in the world. It is continually filled with fleets, fail¬
ing to or from the moft diftant climates) and its banks,
from Lcndon-bridge to Blackwall, form almoft one
continued great magazine of naval ftores) containing
numerous wet docks, dry docks, and yards for the
building of (hips, for the ufe of the merchants) befides
the places alloted for the building of boats and lighters,
and the king’s yards lower down the river for the
building of men of war.
The Weft India Docks are defigned to receive all
the {hips trading to the Weft Indies, and will, when
finifhed, juftly claim a place among the curicfities
for com-
naerce.

of Great Britain. By virtue of an a£t of parliament W.don.
they were undertaken in 1799, the entrances irdo which ‘ y—-J"
are by Blackwall and Limehoufe-hole. The proprie¬
tors began with a capital of 500,000!. with parliamen¬
tary authority to increafe it to 6co,ocq1. if they fliould
find it requifite, and they are to be indemnified by a
tonnage of 6s. upon the burden of every fliip entering
the dock.
The docks at Wapping muft be allowed to be an
important improvement. The prodigious one w’hich
goes by the name of St George’s dock, is capable of
containing 200 {hips, and Shadwell dock will contain
about 50 veflels. The company projecting and carry¬
ing thefe into execution, pofiefs a capital of 1,200,000!.
and the (hares bear a premium. The foundation of
the entrance bafon was laid on the 26th of June, 1802,
and at the lame time the firft ftone of a tobacco ware-
houfe, which is the largeft in the world
As the city is about 60 miles diftant from the tea, it
enjoys, by means of this beautiful river, all the bene¬
fits of navigation, wdthout the danger of being fur-
prifed by foreign fleets, or of Being annoyed by the
moift vapours of the fea. It rifes regularly from the
water fide, and, extending itfelf on both fides along its
banks, reaches a prodigious length from eaft to weft in
a kind of amphitheatre towards the north, and is conti¬
nued for near 20 miles on ail fides, in a fucceffion of
magnificent villas and populous villages, the country-
feats of gentlemen and tradefmen 5 whither the latter
retire for the benefit of frefti air, and to relax their
minds from the hurry of bufinefs. The regard paid
by the legiftature to the property of the fubjeCt, has
hitherto prevented any bounds being fixed for its ex-
tenfion.
The irregular form of London makes it difficult toIt
afeertain its extent. However, its length from eaft to
weft is generally allowed to be above feven miles f^om
Hyde-park corner to Poplar ; and its breadth in fome
plac'-s three, in others two, and in others again not much
above half a mile. Hence the circumference of the
whole is almoft 18 miles j or, according to a later mea-
furement, the extent of continued buildings is 35 miles
two furlongs and 39 roods. But it is much eafier to
form an idea of the large extent of a city To irregularly
built by the number of the people, wdio are computed
to be near a million ) and from the number of edifices
devoted to the fervice of religion.
Of thefe, befide St Paul’s cathedral and the colle- General
giate church at Weftminfter, there are 114 parhh-enumera-
churches and 62 chapels, of the eftablilhed religion) don of
17 foreign Proteftant chapels) 11 chapels belonging c|mrcjies» ^
to the Germans, Dutch, Danes, &c.) 26 Independent 1£t^e S’ *

and 6 Jew’s fynagogues. So that there are above 300
places devoted to religious worfhip in the compafs of
this vaft pile of buildings, without reckoning the 21
out-parifhes ufually included in the bills of mortality,
and a great number of Methodift tabernacles. ] ,c

The Royal Inflitution owyed its origin to a number of
noblemen and gentlemen, wdio held meetings for the
avowed purpofe of ameliorating the condition of the
poor. They firfl proje&ed the plan of its foundation,
which was matured by the exertions and talents of the
indefatigable Count Rumford. The meetings began in
1800, ihortly before which his majefly granted the
proprietors a charter of incorporation by the name of
the Royal Jnjlitution of Great Britain, for the purpofe
of facilitating the general introdudlion of ufeful mecha¬
nical inventions and improvements, and for teaching,
by courfes of philofophical lectures and experiments,
the application of fcience to the common purpofes of
life.
The government of the fociety confifts of the prefi-
dent, 15 managers, and the fecretary, chofen by and
from among the proprietors. Of the 15 managers, one-
third is elected annually, on the firfl of May. The
houfe is fituated in Albemarle-flreet, is extremely fpa-
cious, and well adapted to the purpofes to which it is
applied.
The London Inftitution was formed in the autumn
of 1805, by the indefatigable exertions of a few fpiri-
ted individuals. The houfe in the mean time is in the
Old Jewry, till the managers can procure a more fuitable
place. The defign of it is to promote the difl'emination
of fcience, literature, and the arts: its view at prefent
being confined to three objefts, viz. the acquifition of a
a valuable and extenfive library 5 the diffufion of ufeful
knowledge by the means of leisures and experiments j
and the eftablilhment of a reading room, where the
foreign and domeftic journals are provided for the ufe
of the proprietors and fubferibers. The government of
the inftitution is veiled in a prefident, four vice-preli-
dents, twenty managers, and the fecretary. The num¬
ber of proprietors is limited to ioco, each of whom
paid 75 guineas for a lhare, and the life fubferibers pay
25 guineas.
LONDONDERRY, or Colerain, a county of
Ireland, in the province of Ulfter. It is bounded on
the fouth and fouth-w’eft by the county of Tyronne ;
by Antrim on the eaft, from which it is parted by the
river Bann : by Donegal on the weft j and that county
and the Deucaledonian ocean on the north. Its
greateft length is about 36 miles, its breadth 30, con¬
taining about 251,510 acres. The bogs and heaths
.of this county are manured with fca-lhells, as thofe

of Donegal, Like that, too, it is pretty champaign,
and not unfruitful. It is particularly noted for a very
clear river called the Bann, abounding with falmon, a
fiih faid to delight in limpid ftreams. This river, to
diftinguifli it from a leffer of the fame name, is called
the Greater or Lower Bonn. In order to cultivate,
fettle, and civilize this county, King James I. granted
it, by letters-patent, to a fociety, by the name of the
Governor and AJJiJlants at London of the new plantation
of Uljler in the realm of Ireland. It contains fix ba¬
ronies ; and, belides the two knights of the ftrire, fends
to parliament two members for the city of London¬
derry, and two each for Colerain and Newton-Lima-
vady or Lamnevady.
Londonderry, or Derry, the capital of the county,
and the fee of a bilhop, ilands at the bottom of Lough-
Foyle. This city has a very good port, to w7hich flrips
of the greateft: burden have accefs, and a conliderable
trade. It will be ever famous for the gallantry and
perfeverance with which it defended itfelf in three
memorable fieges, in defiance of the greateft hardihips
and difeouragements, namely, ill, In 1641, when the
rebels could not reduce it either by fraud or force.
2dly, In 1649, when it was belieged by the lord Ardes,
and reduced almoft to extremity by famine, till at lafi:
relieved by troops fent from England. 3dly, When
it held out againll the French and Irilh from the 7th
of December 1688 to the laft day of July 1689,
though it was neither well fortified nor provided with
a garrifon or ftores of provifion and ammunition, and
hardly any attempt made to relieve it during fo long a
time. Though the city is 20 miles up the river, yet
very large Ihips can come up to the quay, where there
are four ox five fathoms of w’ater. It is now well for¬
tified with a ftrong w7all, befides outwmrks j and along
the banks of the river are feveral caftles and a fort.
This city is of no great antiquity, having been built
and planted in the reign of James I. by a colony fent
by the fociety above mentioned. The trade of the
towrn is very confiderable, having not only a large
lhare in the herring fifhery, but fending {hips alfo to
the Weft Indies, New England, and Newfoundland,
for which they are fo advantageoufly fituated, that a
veffel bound from thence to America often arrives
there before a London (hip can get clear of the found¬
ings, or arrive in the latitude of Londonderry. Though
there are a great many {hallows in Lough-Foyle,
which ferves it inftead of a road } yet they are eafily
avoided, as there are deep channels between them.
Thefe points called Emifone, Ruflerhull or Caldy head,
which lie a little to the w7eft of the mouth of the har¬
bour, are counted the moft northerly ot Ireland. The
inhabitants of this city are almoft all Proteftants. It
gave title of earl and baron to a branch of the family
of Pitt, which became extindi in 1764; but part of
the title was revived in Robert Stewrart, who wras creat¬
ed Baron Londonderry in 1789. A late traveller
fays, “ Derry is, perhaps, the cleaneft, beft built, and
moft beautifully fituated town in Ireland ; and except¬
ing Corke, as convenient as any for commerce, foreign
and domeftic.” The lake almoft; furrounds it; and the
whole ground-plot both of it and its liberties belongs to

well known and much approved treatile of aftronomy,
and the inventor of a remarkably curious attronomical
machine, thus defcribed by himfelf. “ I have, in a
room lately built in Pembroke-hall, ere<fted a fphere of
18 feet diameter, wherein above 30 perfons may fit con¬
veniently •, the entrance into it is over the fouth pole by
fix fteps ) the frame of the fphere confifts of a number
of iron meridians, not complete femicircles, the north¬
ern ends of which are fcrewed to a large round plate of
brafs, with a hole in the centre of it 5 through this
hole, from a beam in the ceiling, comes the north pole,
around iron rod, about three inches long, and fupports
the upper parts of the fphere to its proper elevation for
the latitude of Cambridge •, the lower part of the fphere,
fo much of it as is invifible in England, is cut off 5 and
the lower or fouthern ends of the meridians, or trunca¬
ted femicircles, terminate on, and are fcrewed down to,
a ftrong circle of oak, of about 13 feet diameter;
which, when the fphere is put into motion, runs upon
Ikrge rollers of lignum vitae, in the manner that the
tops of fome windmills are made to turn round. Upon
the iron meridians is fixed a zodiac of tin painted blue,
whereon the ecliptic and heliocentric orbits of the pla¬
nets are drawn, and the conftellations and ftars traced :
the Great and Little Bear and Draco are already paint¬
ed in their places round the north pole ; the reft of the
conftellations are propofed to follow7 : the whole is
turned round with a fmall winch, with as little labour
as it takes to wind up a jack, though the weight of the
iron, tin, and wmoden circle, is about 1000 pounds.
When it is made ufe of, a planetarium wall be placed in
the middle thereof. The whole, with the floor, is well
fupported by a frame of large timber.” Thus far Dr
Long, before this curious piece of mechanifm was per-
fedled. Since the above was written, the fphere has
been completely finifhed ; all the conftellations and ftars
of the northern hemifphere, vifible at Cambridge, are
painted in their proper places upon plates of iron joined
together, which form one concave furface. Dr Long
publifhed a Commencement Sermon 1728; and an an
fwer to Dr Galley’s pamphlet on Greek Accents ; and
died December 16th 1770, at the age of 91. As the
materials for this article are fcanty, we fliall fubjoin,
Ter 1783, from the Gentleman’s Magazine *, a few traits of him,
jp. ^83. as delineated in 1769 by Mr Jones. “ He is now in
the 88th year of his age, and for his years vegete and
a£!ive. He w7as lately (in Odftober) put in nomination
for the office of vice-chancellor. He executed that
truft once before, I think in the year 1737 ; a very in¬
genious perfon, and fometimes very facetious. At the
public commencement in the year 1713. Dr Greene
(mafter of Bennet college, and afterwards bilbop of
Ely) being then vice-chancellor, Mr Long was pitched
15 ] LON
upon for the tripos-performance ; it was witty and hu- Longevity,
morous, and has palled through divers editions. Some
that remembered the delivery of it, told me, that in
addrefling the vice-chancellor (whom the univerfity
wags ufually ftyled Mifs Greene}, the tripos-orator, be¬
ing a native of Norfolk, and afluming the Norfolk dia¬
led!, inftead of faying, Dotnine. Vice-Cancel/ant, did
very archly pronounce the words thus, Doming Vice-
Cance/laria; which occafioned a general fmile in that
great auditory. His friend the late Mr Bonfoy of Rip-
ton told me this little incident, 1 That he and Dr Long
walking together in Cambridge in a dulky evening,
and coming to a fhort pq/l fixed in the pavement, which
Mr B. in the midft of chat and inattention, took to be
a boy Handing in his way, he faid in a hurry, ‘ Get
out of my way, boy.’ ‘ That boy, Sir,' faid the doc¬
tor very calmly and llily, is a poftboy, who turns out
of his way for nobody'—I could recoiled!, feveral other
ingenious repartees if there were occafion. One thing
is remarkable, he never was a hale and hearty man, al¬
ways of a tender and delicate conllitution, yet took
great care of it. His common drink w7ater. He always
dines with the fellow’s in the hall. Of late years he
has left off eating flefh-meats ; in the room thereof,,

LONGEVITY, length of life.
_ From the different longevities of men in the begin¬
ning of the world, after the flood, and in thefe ages,.
Mr Derham draws an argument for the interpofition of
a divine Providence.
Immediately after the creation, when the world was¬
te be peopled by one man and one wroman, the ordinary
age was 900 and upwards.—Immediately after the
flood, when there were three perfons to ftock the world,
their age was cut Ihorter, and none of thofe patriarchs,
but Shem, arrived at 500. In the fecond century we
find none that reached 240 : in the third, none but Te-
rah that came to 200 years; the W’orld, at lead a part
of it, by that time being fo w7ell peopled, that they had
built cities, and were cantoned out into diftant nations.
—*By degrees, as the number of people increafed, their
longevity dwindled, till it came down at length to 70.
or 80 years: and there it flood, and has continued to
Hand ever fince the time of Mofes.—This is found a
good medium, and by means hereof the world is neither
overftocked, nor kept too thin ; but life and death keep
a pretty equal pace.
That the common duration of man’s life has been the
fame in all ages fince the above period, is plain both .
from facred and profane hiftory. Xo pafs by others,
Plato lived to 8j, and was accounted an old man : and
the inftances of longevity produced by Pliny, lib. vii.
c. 48. as very extraordinary, may molt of them be
matched in modern hiftories.—In the following Tables
are collefled into/one point of view the moft memorable
inftances of long-lived perfons of whofe age’w’e have any
authentic recoids. Xhe firft and fecond are extra6!ed
from Mr VJaitehurf's Inquiry into the Origin and Strata
of the Earth, with fome additions by Dr Foihergill;

time, peculiarly propitious to longevity. . Lord Ba¬

of Vefpafian, was memorable ; for in that year was a
taxing which afforded the mod authentic method of
knowing the ages of men. From it, there were found
in that part of Italy lying between the Apenmne moun¬

  that it is no unufual thing with the inhabitants of that
county to reach 90 years of age and upwards, and
even to retain their ftrength of body and perfect ufe
of their fenfes. BefideS Brown, the Cornilh beggar,
who lived to 120, and one Polezew to 130 years of
age, he remembered the deceafe of four perfons in his
own pariih, the fum of whofe years, taken colledtively,
amounted to 340. Now, although longevity evident-

(r) This man, in 1789, at the age of 120, quitted his native hills, and from the fummit of Mount Jura un¬
dertook a journey to Verfailles, to behold and return thanks to the national affembly for the vote which had
freed him and his poor countrymen from the feudal yoke. In the early part of his life, he was a fervant in
the family of the prince de Beaufremont. His memory continued good to the lad day of his life ; and the
principal inconveniences which he felt from his great age were, that his fight was weakened, and the natural
heat of his body was fo diminifhed, that he fhivered wfith cold in the middle of the dog-days if he was not fit¬
ting by a good fire. This old man was received in the body of the houfe by the national affembly, indulged
with a chair, and dire6ted to keep on his hat led he fhould catch cold if he was to fit uncovered. A colle6tion
was made for him by the members, which exceeded 500I. derling ; but he lived not to return to Mount Jura.
He was buried on Saturday the 3 id of January 1790, with great funeral pomp, in the parilh-church of St Eudace
at Paris.
(s) He ferved as a private at the taking of Gibraltar in 1704.

A certain author mentions a lift colle&ed by bim-
felf of 107 perfons, who all died at the age of 120 and
upwards. Two of them attained the age of 150, three
of 15 2, one of 154, one of 169, and another 175. In
1763 there were found in Sweden 988 females above
90 years of age. We have feen a lift of 104 perfons,
none of whom died under 1 20 years of age, anti one of
them, it is faid, lived to the prodigious age of 180.
Forty-one of them belonged to England, 16 to Scot¬
land, and 24 to Ireland.
The antediluvians are purpofely omitted, as bearing
too little reference to the prefent race of mortals, to af¬
ford any fatisfaftory concluftonsj and as they have been
already taken notice of in a feparate article •, (fee An¬
tediluvians). As the improbable ftories of fome
perfons who have almoft rivalled them in modern
times, border too much upon the marvellous to find
a place in thefe tables, the prefent examples are a-
bundantly fufficient to prove, that longevity does not
depend, fo much as has been fuppofed, on any par¬
ticular climate, fituation, or occupation in life : for
we fee, that it often prevails in places where all
thefe are extremely diffimilar j and it would, moreover,
be very difficult, in the hiftories of the feveral perfons
above mentioned, to find any circumflance common to
them all, except, perhaps, that of being born of heal¬
thy parents, and of being inured to daily labour, tem¬
perance, and fimplicity of diet. Among the inferior
ranks of mankind, therefore, rather than among the
fons of eafe and luxury, ftiall we find the moft numer^
ous inftances of longevity 5 even frequently, when o-
ther external circumitances feem extremely unfavour¬
able ; as in the cafe of the poor fexton at Peterbo¬
rough, who, notwithftanding his unpromifing occupa¬
tion among dead bodies, lived long enough to bury two
crowned heads, and to furvive two complete genera¬
tions. The livelihood of Henry Jenkins and old
Parre is faid to have confifted chiefly of the coarfeft '
fare, as they depended on precarious alms. To which
may be added the remarkable inftance of Agnes Mil-
bourne, who, after bringing forth a numerous off-
fpring, and being obliged, through extreme indigence,
to pafs the latter part of her life in St Luke’s wrork-
houfe, yet reached her 106th year in that fordid and
unfriendly fi'tuation. The plain diet and invigorating
employments of a country life are acknowledged on
all hands to be highly conducive to health and longe¬
vity, while the luxury and refinements of large cities
are allowed to be equally deftruflive to the human fpe-
cies; and this confideration alone, perhaps, more than
counterbalances all the boafted privileges of fuperior
elegance and civilization refulting from a city life.
From country villages, and not from crowded ci¬
ties, have the preceding inftances of longevity been
chiefly fupplied. Accordingly it appears, from the
London bills of mortality, during a period of 30 years,
viz. from the year 1728 to 1758, the fum of the
deaths amounted to 750,322, and that, in all this
prodigious number, only 242 perfons furvived the
1 ooth year of their age ! This overgrown metropo¬
lis is computed by Dr Price to contain a ninth
part of the inhabitants of England, and to con-
fume annually 7000 perfons, who remove into it
from the country every year, wdthout increafing it.
He moreover obferves, that the number of inhabitants
in England and Wales has diminiffied about one-fourth
part fince the Revolution ; and fo rapidly of late, that
in 11 years, near 200,000 of our common people have
been loft. If the calculation be juft, however alarming
it may appear in a national view, there is this confo-
lation, wffien confidered in a philofophical light, that
without partial evil, there can be no general good *,

was bred in the midft of want and hardffiips, cold, hunger, and for fhe years of his apprenticeffiip with a
mafon and ftone-cutter in Invernefs, in inceffant fatigue. He inlifted, wdien a boy, in the Scottiffi fervice,
in the town of Perth in the laft year of the reign of King William. The regiment into which he inlifted
was the Scots Royals, commanded by the earl of Orkney. That old military corps, at that time, ufed bows and
arrows as well as fwords, and wore fteel caps. He ferved in Germany and Flanders under the duke of Marlborough;
under the duke of Argyle, in the rebellion 1715-, in the Highland Watch, or companies raifed for enforcing
the laws in the Highlands 5 in the fame companies when, under the name of the 42d regiment, they were
lent abroad to Flanders, to join the army under the duke of Cumberland j in the fame regiment in Ireland,
and on the breaking out of the French war, 1757, in America. From the 42d he was draughted to a£t as
a drill ferjeant in the 78th regiment, in which he ferved at the reduffion of Louifhurg and Quebec : After
this he became an out-penfioner of Chelfea Hofpital. But fuch was the fpirit of this brave and hardy ve¬
teran, that he ferved in 1761 as a volunteer in Germany under the marquis of Granby ; and offered his
fervices in the American war to Sir Henry Clinton j who, though he declined to employ the old man in the
fatigues and dangers of war, treated him with great kindnefs, allowed him a liberal weekly penfion out of his
own pocket, and fent him home in a ftiip charged with defpatches to government.—T he ferjeant, “ as his
memory, according to the obfervation of his biographer, is impaired, does not pretend to make an exaff enu¬
meration of all his offspring : but he knowrs of 16 fons now living, 14 of. whom are in the army and navy, be-
fides daughters ; the eldeft of whom by his prefent wife is a mantuamaker at Nervcaftle.—His eldeft fon is now
83 years old, and the youngeft only nine. Nor, in all probability, would this lad clofe the rear of his immedi¬
ate progeny, if his prefent wife, the boy’s mother, had not attained to the 49th year of her age.”—In his
prime, he did not exceed five feet and feven inches. He is now inclined through age to five feet five inches.
He has an interefting phyfiognomy, expreffive of fincerity, fenfibility, and manly courage. His biographer
very properly fubmits it to the confideration of the Polygraphic Society, whether they might not do a thing
worthy of themfelves and their ingenious art, if they ffiould multiply likeneffes of this living antiquity, and cir¬
culate them at an eafy rate throughout Britain and Europe. They would thus gratify a very general cunolity y
a.curiofity not ^confined to the prefent age.

longevity, and tViat what a nation lofes in tlie fcale of population
" v ’ gt; one period, it gams at anOi.Iier ^ and thus prooably,
the average number of inhabitants on the furface
of the globe continues at all times nearly the fame.
By this medium, the world is neither overltocked with
inhabitants nor kept too thin, but life and death keep
a tolerably equal pace. The inhabitants of this ifland,
comparatively fpeaking, are but as the dull of the ba¬
lance ; yet inftead, of being diminilhed, we are aflured
by other writers, that within thefe 30 years they are
greatly increafed.
The defire of felf-prefervation, and of protraftitig
the (hort fpan of life, is fo intimately interwoven with
our conllitution, that it is juftly efteemed one of the
firft principles of our nature, and, in fpite even of pain
and mifery, feldom quits us to the laft moments of
our exiftence. It feems, therefore, to be no lefs our
duty than our intereft, to examine minutely into the
various means that have been confidered as conducive
to health and long life: and, if poffible, to diftinguilh
fuch circumftances as are effential to that great end
from thofe which are merely accidental. But here it
is much to be regretted, that an accurate hiftory of
the lives of all the remarkable perfons in the above
table, fo far as relates to the diet, regimen, and the
ufe of the non-naturals, has not been faithfully handed
down to us £ without which it is impoflible to draw
the neceflary inferences. Is it not then a matter of
aflonifhment, that hiftorians and philofophers have hi¬
therto paid fo little attention to longevity ? If the pre-
fent imperfed! lift fhould excite others, of more leifure
and better abilities, to undertake a full inveftigation
of fo interefting a fubjedl, the inquiry might prove not
only curious but highly ufeful to mankind. In or¬
der to furniftr materials for a future hiftory of longe¬
vity, the bills of mortality throughout the kingdom
ought firft to be revifed, and put on a better footing,
agreeable to the fcheme of which Manchefter and Chef-
ter have already given a fpecimen highly worthy of
imitation. The plan, however, might be further im¬
proved with very little trouble, by adding a particular
account of the diet and regimen of every perfon who
dies at 80 years of age or upwards; and mentioning
whether his parents were healthy, long-lived people,
&c. An accurate regifter, thus eftablilhed through¬
out the Britifh dominions, wdiould be produclive of
many important advantages to fociety, not only in a
medical and philofophical, but alfo in a political and
moral view.
All the circumftances that are moft effentially necef-
fary to life, may be comprifed under the fix follow¬
ing heads: 1. Air and climate j 2. Meat and drink;
3. Motion and reft ; 4. The fecretions and excretions ;
5. Sleep and notching ; 6. Affeftions of the mind.
Thefe, though all perfeflly natural to the conftitu-
tion, have by waiters been ftyled the non-naturals, by
a ftrange perverfion of language ; and have been all
copioully handled under that improper term. How¬
ever, it may not be amifs to offer a few fhort obferva-
tions on each, as they are fo immediately connefted
with the prefent fubjeft.
1. AVr, &c. It has long been known that frefti air is
more immediately neceffary to life than food; for a man
may live two or three days without the latter, but not
many minutes without the former. The vivifying
9 1 LON
principle contained in the atmofphere, fo effential to Longevity.^
the fupport of flame, as well as animal lile, concern¬
ing wrhich authors have propofed fo many conjedlureSj
appears now to be nothing elfe but that pure dephlo-
gifticated Huid lately difeovered by that ingenious phi-
lofopher Dr Prieftley. The common atmofphere may
well be fuppofed to be more or lefs healthy in propor¬
tion as it abounds with this animating principle. As
this exhales in copious fleams from the green leaves
of all kinds of vegetables, even from thofe of the moft
poifonous kinds, may we not, in fome meafure account
why inftances of longevity are fo much more frequent
in the country than in large cities ; where the air, in¬
ftead of partaking fo largely of this.falutary impregna¬
tion, is daily contaminated with noxious animal effluvia
and phlogifton ?
With refpedt to climate, various obfervations con-
fpire to prove, that thofe regions wrhich lie within the
temperate zones are beft calculated to promote long
life. Hence, perhaps, may be explained, why Italy
has produced fo many long livers, and why itlands in
general are more falutary than continents; of which
Bermudas and fome others afford examples. And it
is a pleafing circumftance that our own illand ap¬
pears from the above table (notwithftanding the hid¬
den vicifiitudes to which it is liable) to contain far
more inftances of longevity than could well be imagin¬
ed. The ingenious Mr Wfflitehurft affures us, from
certain fads, that Engliftimen are in general longer
lived than North Americans; and that a Britilh con-
ftitution will laft longer, even in that climate, than a
native one. But it muft be allowed in general, that
the human conftitution is adapted to the peculiar ftate
and temperature of each relpective climate, fo that no
part of the habitable globe can be pronounced too hot
or too cold for its inhabitants. Yet, in order to pro¬
mote a friendly intercourfe between the moft remote
regions, the Author of nature has wifely enabled the
inhabitants to endure great and furprifing chnges of
temperature with impunity.
2. Foods and drinh. Though foods and drink of
the moft fimple kinds are allowed to be the beft cal¬
culated for fupporting the body in health, yet it can
hardly be doubted but variety may be fafely indulged
occafionally, provided men would reftrain their appe¬
tites within the bounds of temperance : for bounti¬
ful Nature cannot be fuppofed to have poured forth
fuch a rich profufion of provifions, merely to tantalize
the human fpecies, without attributing to her the part
of a cruel ftepdame, inftead of that of the kind and
indulgent parent. Befides, we find, that by the won¬
derful powers of the digeftive organs, a variety of ani¬
mal and vegetable fubftances, of very difeordant prin¬
ciples, are happily affimilated into one bland homoge¬
neous chyle ; therefore it feems natural to diftruft thofe
cynical writers, who would rigidly confine mankind to
one fimple difh, and their drink to the mere water of
the brook. Nature, it is true, has' pointed out that mild
infipid tluid as the univerfal diluent, and therefore moft;
admirably adapted for our daily beverage. But expe¬
rience has equally proved, that vinous and fpirituous
liquors, on certain occafions, are no lefs falutary and
beneficial, whether it be to fupport ftrength againft
ficknefs or bodily fatigue, or to exhilerate the mind^
under the preffure of heavy misfortunes. But, a^as .
E e 2 what
LON r 220 ] LON
Hongitu^e. wliat Nature meant for innocent and ufeful cordials,
w—“V 1 to be ufed only occafionally, and according to the di-
reftion of reafon, cuftom and caprice have by degrees
rendered habitual to the human frame, and liable to
the mod enormous and deftru&ive abufes. Hence it
may be judly doubted, whether gluttony and intem¬
perance have not depopulated the world more than
even the fword, pedilence, and famine. True, there¬
fore, is the old maxim, “ Modus atcndi ex veneno facit
medic amentum, ex medicamento venenurn.
3. and 4. Motion and rejl, Jleep and watching. It
is allowed on all hands, that alternate motion and red,
and deep and watching, are neceffary conditions to
health and longevity j and that they ought to be adapt¬
ed to age, temperament, conditution, temperature of
the climate, &.c. 5 but the errors which mankind daily
commit in thefe refpefts become a fruitful fource of
difeafes. While fome are bloated and relaxed wdth
eafe and indolence, others are emaciated, and become
rigid through hard labour, watching, and fatigue.
5. Secretions and excretions. Where the animal
fun£lions are duly performed, the fecretions go on re¬
gularly 5 and the different evacuations fo exaftly cor-
refpond to the quantity of aliment taken in, in a given
time, that the body is found to return daily to nearly
the fame weight. If any particular evacuation happen
to be preternaturally diminidied, fome other evacua¬
tion is proportionally augmented, and the equilibrium
is commonly preferved ; but continued irregularities,
in thefe important functions, cannot but terminate in
difeafe.
6. AffeEiions of the mind. The due regulation of
the paffions, perhaps, contributes more to health and
longevity than that of any other of the non-naturals.
The animating pafiions, fuch as joy, hope, love, &c.
when kept within proper bounds, gently excite the
nervous influence, promote an equable circulation, and
are highly conducive to health •, while the deprefling
affedlions, fuch as fear, grief, and defpair, produce the
contrary effect, and lay the foundation of the moil for¬
midable difeafes.
From the light which hiftory affords us, as well as
from fome inftances in the above table, there is great
reafon to believe, that longevity is in a great meafure
hereditary •, and that healthy long-lived parents would
commonly tranfmit the fame to their children, were it
' not for the frequent errors in the non-naturals, which
lb evidently tend to the abbreviation of human life.
Where is it, but from thefe caufes, and the unnatu¬
ral modes of living, that, of all the children which are
born in the capital cities of Europe, nearly -one half
die in early infancy ? To what elfe can we attribute
this extraordinary mortality ? Such an amazing pro¬
portion of premature deaths is a circumftance unheard
of among favage nations, or among the young of other
animals! In the earlieft ages, we are informed, that
human life was protrafted to a very extraordinary
length} yet how few perfons, in thefe latter times,
arrive at that period which nature feems to have de-
figned ! Man is by nature a field animal, and feems de-
flined to rife with the fuu, and to fpend a large por¬
tion of his time in the open air, to inure his body to
rebuff exercifes and the inclemency of the feafons,
and to make a plain homely repaft only when hunger
di&ates. But art has ffudioufly defeated the kind
intentions of nature ; and by enflaving him to all the I^n-ford,
blandhhments of fenfe, has left him, alas ! an eafy vie-
tim to folly 'an,d caprice. To enumerate the various _ ' ,
abufes which take place from the earlieft infancy, and
which are continued through the fucceeding ftages of
modifh lifej would carry us far beyond our prefent
intention. Suffice it to obferve, that they prevail more
particularly among people wdio are the moft highly
polilhed and refined. To compare their artificial mode
of life with that of nature, or even with the long-livers
in the lift, would probably afford a very ftriking con-
traft ; and at the fame time fupply an additional reafon
why, in the very large cities, inftances of longevity are.
fo very rare.
LONGFORD, a county of Ireland, in the pro¬
vince of Leintler, bounded by the counties of Leitrim
and Cavan on the north, Meath on the eaft and fouth,
and Rofcommon on the weft. It contains 143,700
Irifti plantation acres, 24 pariihes, 6 baronies, and 4
boroughs 5 and returns 10 members to parliament. It
is fmall, and much encumbered whh bog, intermixed
with a tolerable good loil \ and is about 25 miles long
and 1 5 broad.
Longford, a town of Ireland, fituated on the ri¬
ver Cromlin, in the county of Longford and province
of Leinfter, 64 miles from Dublin } which river falls
a few miles below this place into the Shannon. It is
a borough, poft, market, and fair town 5 and returns
two members to parliament 5 patron, Lord Longford.
It gave title of earl to the family of Aungier ; oiyif
count, to the family of Micklethwaite ; and now gives
that of baron to the family of Packenham. Within a
mile and a half of the town is a charter-fchool for
above 40 children. This place has a barrack for a
troop of horfe. It is large and wrell built j and in a
very early age an abbey was founded here, of wdiich
St Idus, one of St Patrick’s difciples, was abbot. In
the year 1400, a fine monaftery was founded to the
honour of the Virgin Mary, for Dominican friars, by
O’Ferral prince of Annaly. This monaftery being de-
ftroyed by fire, Pope Martin V. by a bull in the year
1429, granted an indulgence to all who ftiould contri¬
bute to the rebuilding of it. In I433> P°Pe Ej1*
gene IV. granted a bull to the fame purpofe ; and in
1438 he granted another to the like effefl. I he
church of this friary, now the parith church, is in the
diocefe of Ardagh. T he fairs are four in the year..
LONG-island, is an ifland of North .America,
belonging to the ftate of New-York, which is feparat-

tends from the city of New7-York eaft 140 mdes, tei-
minating wdth IVIontauk point 5 and is not more than
10 miles in breadth on a medium. It is divided into
three counties, King’s, Queen’s, and Suffolk. I he
fouth fide of the ifland is flat land, of a light fandy
foil, bordered on the fea-coaft with large trails of fait
meadow, extending from the weft point of the ifland
to Southampton. This foil, however, is well calcu¬
lated for raifing grain, efpecially Indian corn, ft he
north fide of the ifland is hilly., and of a ftrong foil,
adapted to the culture of grain, hay, and fruit. A
ridge of hills extends from Jamaica to South-hold.
Large herds of cattle feed upon Hampftead plain and
on the fait marfhes upon the fouth fide of the ifland.
Hampftead plain in Queen’s county is a curiofity. It

try wide. The foil is black and to appearance rich, and
11. yet it was never known to have any natural growth,
ongnais.^ a i^r} 0f grafs and a few fhrubs. It is fre¬
quented by vaft numbers of plover. Rye grows toler¬
ably w’ell on fome parts of the plain. The mcrft of
it lies common for cattle, horfes, and ftieep. As there
is nothing to impede the profpeft in the whole length
of this plain, it has a curious but tirefome effedt upon
the eye, not unlike that of the ocean. The illand
contains 30,863 inhabitants.

LONGING, is a preternatural appetite in pregnant
w'omen, and in fome fick perfons wrhen about to recover.
It is called pica, from the bird of that name, which is
faid to be fubjeft to the fame diforder. The diforder
confifts of both a defire of unufual things to eat and
drink, and in being foon tired of one and wanting
another. It is called • 77ztf/<2£7h, from “ w7eak-
nefs.” In pregnant women it is fomewhat relieved by
bleeding, and in about the fourth month of their preg¬
nancy it leaves them. Chlorotic girls, and men wdio
labour under fuppreffed hemorrhoids, are very fubjeft
to this complaint, and are relieved by promoting the
refpecfive evacuations. In general, whether this dif¬
order is obferved in pregnant women, in perfons re¬
covering from an acute fever, or thofe w’ho labour un¬
der obftrucfions of the natural evacuations, this craving
of the appetite fhould be indulged.
LONGINICO, a town of Turkey in Europe, in
the Morea, anciently called Olympia, famous for being
the place where the Olympic games were celebrated,

LONGINUS, Dionysius, a celebrated Greek cri¬
tic of the third century, was probably an Athenian.
His father’s name is unknown, but by his mother he
was allied to the celebrated Plutarch. His youth was
fpent in travelling with his parents, which gave him an
opportunity to increafe his knowledge, and improve
his mind. After his travels, he fixed his refidence at
Athens, and with the greateft aftiduity applied to ftudy.
Here he publifhed his Treatife on the Sublime ; wdiich
railed his reputation to fuch a height, and gave the
Athenians fuch an opinion of his judgement and tafte,
that they made him fovereign judge of all authors, and
every thing was received and reje£ted by the public
according to his decifions. He feems to have ilaid at
Athens a long time j here he taught the academic phi-
lofophy, and among others had the famous Porphyry
for his pupil. But it was at length his fortune to be
drawn from Athens, and to mix in more aftive fcenes •,
to train up young princes to virtue and glory j to guide
the bufy paflions of the great to noble objefts 5 to
ftruggle for, and at laft to die in, the caufe of liberty.
Zenobia, queen of the Eaft, prevailed on him to un¬
dertake the education of her fons : and he foon gained
an uncommon ftiare in her efteem : (he fpent the vacant
hours of her life in his converfation, and modelled her
fentiments and condudl by his inftruflions. That prin-
cefs was at war with Aurelian j and being defeated by
11 ] LON
him near Antioch, was compelled to (hut herfelf up in Lorglffi-
Palmyra, her capital city. The emperor wrote her a 11
letter, in which he ordered her to furrender \ to which
(he returned an anfwer, drawn up by Longinus, which
filled him with refentraent. The emperor laid fiege to
the city j and the Palmyrians were at length obliged
to open their gates and receive the conqueror. The
queen and Longinus endeavoured to fly into Perfia ;
but were unhappily overtaken and made prifoners when
they were on the point of eroding the Euphrates. The
queen, intimidated, weakly laid the blame of vindicat¬
ing the liberty of her country on its true author j and
the brave Longinus, to the difgrace of the conqueror,
was carried wray to immediate execution. The wnit-
ings of Longinus were numerous, fome on philofophi-
cal, but the greater part on critical fubjefts. Dr
Pearce has colledled the titles of 25 treadles, none of
which, excepting that on the Sublime, have efcaped
the depredations of time and barbarians. On this im-
perfeft piece the great fame of Longinus is railed,
wTho, as Pope exprefies it—“ is himfelf the great fu-
blime he draws.” The beft edition of his vvoiks is
that by Tollius, printed at Utrecht in 1694, cutn noth
variorum. It has been tranflated into Englifti by Mr
Smith.

LONGITUDE, in Geography and Navigation, is
the diftance of any place from another eaftward or weft-
ward, counted in degrees upon the equator : but when
the diftance is reckoned by leagues or miles and not in
degrees, or in degrees on the meridian, and not of the
parallel of latitude, in which cafe it includes both lati¬
tude and longitude, it is called departure.
To find the longitude at fea, is a problem to which
the attention of navigators and mathematicians has
been drawn ever fince navigation began to be improv¬
ed.—The importance of this problem foon became fo
well knowm, that, in 1598, Philip III. of Spain of¬
fered a reward of 1000 crowns for the folution ; and •
his example was foon follow’ed by the Spates General,
who offered 10,000 florins. In 1714 an aft was paf-
fed in the Britilh parliament, empowering certain com-
miflioners to make out a bill for a fum not exceeding
2000I. for defraying the neceffary expences of expe¬
riments for afeertaining this point $ and likewdfe grant¬
ing a reward to the perfon who made any progrefs in
the folution, proportionable to the degree of accuracy
with which the folution was performed : 10,000k was
granted if the longitude (hould be determined to one
degree of a great circle, or 60 geographical miles ;
15,000!. if to two thirds of that diftance j and 20,000k
if to half the diftance.
In confequence of thefe proffered rewards, innumer¬
able attempts were made to difeover this important fe-
cret. The firft was that of John Morin profeffor of ma¬
thematics at Paris, who propofed it to Cardinal Riche¬
lieu ; and though it was judged infufticient on account
of the imperfeftion of the lunar tables, a penfion of
2000 livres per annum was procured for him in 1645
by Cardinal Mazarine. Gemma Frifius had indeed, in
1530, projefted a method of finding the longitude by
means of watches, which at that time were newly in¬
vented : but the ftrufture of thefe machines w’as then
by far too imperfeft to admit of any attempt; aor even
in
LON [22:
}/jfrgitu*e. in 1631, when Metius made an attempt to this purpofe,
c 'T—* were they advanced in any confiderable degree. About
the year 1664, Dr Hooke and Mr Huygens made a
x very great improver„ent in watchmaking, by the appli¬
cation of the pendulum fpring. Dr Hooke having
quarrelled with the minittry, no experiment was made
with any of his machines 5 but many were made with
thofe of Mr Huygens. One experiment particularly,
made by Mapr Holmes, in a voyage from the coalt of
Guinea in 1665, anfwered fo well, that Mr Huygens
was encouraged to improve the ftru&ure of his watches :
but it was found that the variations of heat and cold
produced fuch alterations in the rate of going of the
watch, that unlefs this could be remedied, the watches
could be of little ufe in determining the longitude.
In 1714 Henry Sully, an Englidiman, printed a
fmall traft at Vienna upon the fubje£l of watchmaking.
Having afterwards removed to Paris, he applied himfelf
to the improvement of time-keepers for the difcovery of
the longitude. He taught the famous Julian de Roy :
and this gentleman, with his fon, and M. Berthoud,
are the only perfons who iince the days of Sully, have
turned their thoughts this wTay. But though experi¬
ments have been made at fea with fome of their watch¬
es, it does not appear that they have been able to ac-
compliih any thing of importance with regard to the
main point. The firfl: who fucceeded in any confider¬
able degree was Mr John Harrifon •, who, in 1726,
produced a watch which went fo exaftly, that for ten
years together it did not err above one fecond in a
•month. In 1736 it was tried in a voyage to Lilbon
and back again, on board one of his majefty’s fliips ;
during which it corredled an error of a degree and a
half in the computation of the (hip’s reckoning. In
confequence of this he received public encouragement
to go on : and by the year 1761 had finifhed three
time-keepers, each of them more accurate than the
former. The laft turned out fo much to his fatisfaflion,
that he now applied to the commiffioners of longitude
lor leave to make an experiment with his watch in a
voyage to the Weft Indies. Permiftion being granted,
his fon Mr William Harrifon fet out in his majefty’s
fhip the Deptford for Jamaica in the month of Novem¬
ber 1761. This trial wras attended with all imaginable
fuccels. The longitude of the ifland, as determined by
the time-keeper, differed from that found by aftrono-
mical obfervations only one minute and a quarter of the
equator ; the longitudes of places feen by the way be¬
ing alfo determined with great exaftnefs. On the (hip’s
return to England, it was found to have erred no more
during the whole voyage than 1' 54^-" in time, which
is little more than 28 miles in diftance •, which being
within the limits prefcribed by the aft, the inventor
claimed the whole ’20,0001. offered by government.
Objeftions to this, however, were foon darted. Doubts
w'ere pretended about the real longitude of Jamaica,
as well as the manner in which the time had been
found both there and at Portfmouth. It w?as alleged
alfo, that although the time-keeper happened to be
flight at Jamaica, and after its return to England, this
was by no means a proof that it had always been fo
in the intermediate times *, in confequence of which al¬
legations, another trial was appointed in a voyage to
Barbadoes. Precautions were now taken to obviate as
many of thefe objeftions as poffible. The commif-
2 ] LON
(loners fent out proper perfons to make aftronomical Longitude:
obfervations at that ifland : which, when compared't—
with others in England, wTould afcertain beyond a doubt
its true fituation. In 1 764 then,, Mr Harrifon junior
fet fail for Barbadoes *, and the refult of the experi¬
ment wras, that the difference of longitude betwixt
Portfmouth and Barbadoes was drown by the time¬
keeper to be 3b. 55' 3" j and by aftronomical obfer¬
vations to be 3b. 54' 20"; the error being now only
43" of time, or 10' 45" of longitude. In confequence
of this and the former trials, Mr Harrifon received one
half of the reward promifed, upon making a difcovery
of the principles upon which his time-keepers were con-
ftrufted. He w^as likewife promifed the other half of
the reward as foon as time-keepers fhould be conftruft-
ed by other artifts which (hould anfwer the purpofe as
well as thofe of Mr Harrifon himfelf. At this time he
delivered up all his time-keepeis, the laft of which was
fent to Greenwich to be tried by Mr Nevil Malkelyne,
the aftronomer-royal. On trial, howTever, it was found
to go with much lefs regularity than had been expeft-
ed j but Mr Harrifon attributed this to his having
made fome experiments with it which he had not time
to finifh w hen he was ordered to deliver up the watch.
Soon after this, an agreement was made by the com¬
miffioners with Mr Kendall to conftruft a watch upon
Mr Harrifon’s principles ; and this upon trial w^as found
to anfwer the purpofe even better than any that Har¬
rifon himfelf had conftrufted. This watch was fent
out with Captain Cook in 1772 ; and during all the
time of his voyage round the world in I772> I773»
1774, and 1775, never erred quite 144- feconds per
day : in confequence of which, the houfe of commons,
in 1774, ordered the other io,oool. to be paid to
Mr Harrifon. Still greater accuracy, however, has
been attained. A w-atch was lately conftrufted by
Mr Arnold, which, during a trial of 1 3 months, from
February 1779 to February 1780, varied no more
than’ 6.69" during any two days •, and the greateft
difference between its rates of going on any day and
the next to it was 4.11". The greateft error it wmuld
have committed therefore in the longitude during any
(ingle day would have been very little more than one
minute of longitude } and thus might the longitude be
determined with as great exaftnefs as the latitude gene¬
rally can.—This watch, however, has not yet been
tried at fea.
Thus the method df conftrufting time-keepers for
difcovering the longitude feeras to be brought to as
great a degree of perfeftion as can well be expefted.
Still, however, as thefe watches are fubjeft to acci¬
dents, and may thus alter the rate of their going with¬
out any poflibility of a difcovery, it is neceffary that
fome other method (hould be fallen upon, in order to
correft from time to time thofe errors which may arife
either from the natural going of the w^atch, or from
any accident which may happen to it. Methods of
this kind are all founded upon celeftial obfervations of
fome kind or other •, and for thefe methods, or even
for an improvement in time-keepers, rewards are dill
held out by government. After the difcoveries made
by Mr Harrifon, the aft concerning the longitude
was repealed, excepting fo much of it as related to the
conftrufting, printing, publifliing, &c. of nautical al¬
manacks and other ufeful tables. It was enafted al fb,
that
LON { 2:
Longitude, that-any perfon who (hall difcover a method for find-
l" ing the longitude by means of a time-keeper, the prin¬
ciples of which have not hitherto been made public,
fhall be entitled to a reward of 5000I. if, after cer¬
tain trials made by the commiffioners, the faid method
fliall enable a (hip to keep her longitude, during a voy-
' age of fix months, within 60 geographical miles, or a
degree of a great circle. If the fhip keeps her longi¬
tude within 40 geographical miles' for that time, the
inventor is entitled to a reward of 7500I. and to
10,cool, if, the longitude is kept within half a de¬
gree. If the method is by improved afironomical
tables, the author is entitled to 5000I. when they
{how the diflance of the moon from the fun and ftars
within 15 feconds of a degree, anfwerlng to about
7 minutes of longitude, after allowing half a degree for
errors of obfervation and under certain reftridiions,
and after comparifon with aftronomical obfervations
for a period of 184- years, during which the lunar ir¬
regularities are fuppofed to be completed. The fame
rewards are offered to the perfon who fhall wdth the
like accuracy difcover any other method of finding the
longitude.
Thefe methods require celeftial obfervations ; and
any of the phenomena, fuch as the different apparent
places of ftars with regard to the moon, the beginning
and ending of eclipfes, &c. wall anfvver the purpofe :
only it is abfolutely neceffary that fome variation fhould
be perceptible in the phenomenon in the fpace of tw'o
minutes 5 for even this (hort fpace of time will pro¬
duce an error of 30 miles in longitude. The moft
proper phenomena therefore for determining the lon¬
gitude in this manner are the eclipfes of Jupiter’s fa-
tellites. Tables of their motions have been conftrudl-
ed, and carefully corredled from time to time, as the
mutual attradlions of thefe bodies are found greatly to
difturb the regularity of their motions. The difficulty
here, however, is to obferve thefe eclipfes at fea ; and
this difficulty has been found fo great, that no perfon
feems able to furmount it. The difficulty arifes from
the violent agitation of a (hip in the ocean, for which
no adequate remedy has ever yet been found, nor pro¬
bably will ever be found. Mr Chriftopher Irwin in¬
deed invented a machine which he called a marine
chair, with a view to prevent the effeifls of this agita¬
tion ; but on trying it in a voyage to Earbadoes, it was
found to be totally ufelefs.
A whimfical method of finding the longitude was
propofed by Meffrs Whifton and Ditton from the re¬
port and flaffi of great guns. The motion of found is
known to be nearly equable, from whatever body it pro¬
ceeds or whatever be the medium. Suppofing there¬
fore a mortar to be fired at any place the longitude of
which is known, the difference between the moment
that the flaffi is feen and the report heard will give
the diftances between the two places; whence, if we
know the latitudes of thefe places, their longitudes
muft alfo be known. If the exafl time of the explo-
fion be known at the place where it happens, the
difference of time at the place where it is heard will
likewife give the difference of longitude. Let us next
fuppofe the mortar to be loaded with an iron ffiell
filled with combuftible matter, and fired perpendicu¬
larly upward into the air, the ftiell wdll be carried to
the height of a mile, and will be feen at the diftance of
3 ] LG N
near 100 j whence* fuppoftng neither the flaffi of the Longitude,
mortar ffiould be feen nor the report heard, ftill the
longitude might be determined by the altitude of the
ftiell above the horizon.
According to this plan, mortars were to be fired at
certain times and at proper ftations along all frequented
coafts for the dire£lion of mariners. This indeed might
be of ufe, and in ftormy weather might be a kind of
improvement in lighthoufes, or a proper addition to
them $ but with regard to the determination of longi¬
tudes, is evidently ridiculous.
We fliall now proceed to give fome pradlical direc¬
tions for finding the longitude at fea by proper ce¬
leftial obfervations ; exclufive of thofe from Jupiter’s
fatellites, which, for reafons juft mentioned, cannot
be praclifed at fea. In the firft place, however, it will
be neceffary to point out fome of thofe difficulties
which ftand in the way, and which render even this
method of finding the longitude precarious and uncer¬
tain. Thefe lie principally in the redudlion of the ob¬
fervations of the heavenly bodies made on the furface of
the earth to fimilar obfervations fuppofed to be made at
the centre ; which is the only place where the celeftial
bodies appear in their proper fituation. It is alfo verv
difficult to make proper allowances for the refraction of
the atmofphere, by which all objedls appear higher than
theyr really are ; and another difficulty arifes from their
parallaxes, which make them, particularly the moon,
appear lower than they would otherwife do, excepting
when they are in the very zenith. It is alfo well known,
that the nearer the horizon any celeftial body is, the
greater its parallax will be ; and as the parallax and
refradlion aft in oppofite ways to one another, the for¬
mer depreffing and the latter raifing the objeft, it is
plain, that great difficulties muft arife from this circum-
ftance. The fun, for inftance, whofe parallax is lefs
than the refraftion, muft always appear higher than he
really is but the moon, whofe parallax is greater than
her refraftion, muft always, appear lower.
To render obfervations of the celeftial bodies more
eafy, the commiffioners of longitude have caufed an.
Ephemeris or Nautical Almanack to be publiffied an¬
nually, containing every requifite for folving this im¬
portant problem which can be put into the form of ta¬
bles. But whatever may be done in this way, it will
be neceffary to make the neceffary preparations concern¬
ing the dip of the horizon, the refraftion, femidiame-
ters, parallax, &c. in order to reduce the apparent to
the true altitudes and diftances ■, for which wTe ffiall here
fubjoin two general rules.
The principal obfervation for finding the longitude
at fea is that of the moon from the fun, or from
fome remarkable ftar near the zodiac. To do this,
the operator muft be furniftied with a watch which
can be depended upon for keeping time within a mi¬
nute for fix hours; and with a good Hadley’s qua¬
drant, or, which is preferable, a fextant : and this laft
inftrument will ftill he more fit for the purpofe if it be
furniftied with a ferew for moving the index gradually j
likewife an additional dark glafs, but not fo dark as
the common kind, for taking off the glare of the moon’s
light in obferving her diftance from a ftar. A fmall
telefcope, wffiich may magnify three or four times, is
alfo necefiary to render the contaft of a ftar with the
moon’s limb more difcernible. A magnifying glafs of
one
%
LON ' [ 224 ] . LON
Xongitnde. one and a half or two inches focus will likewife affift
  v 1 the operator in reading off his obfervations with the
greater facility.
1. To make the obfervation. Having examined and
adjufted his inftrument as well as poflible, the obferver
is next to proceed in the following manner ; If the di-
ftance of the moon from the fun is to be obferved, turn
down one of the fcreens *, look at the moon direftly
through the tranfparent part of the horizon-glafs ; and
keeping her in view, gently move the index till the
fun’s image be brought into the filvered part of that
glafs. Bring the neareft limbs of both objefts into
contacl, and let the quadrant librate a little on the lu¬
nar ray •, by which means the fun will appear to rife
and fall by the fide of the moon j in which motion the
neareft limbs muft be made to touch one another exaft-
ly by moving the index. Ihe obfervation is then
made ; and the divifion coinciding with that on the
Vernier fcale, will fhow the diftance of the neareft limbs
of the objefts.
When the diftance of the moon from a ftar is to be
obferved when the moon is very bright, turn down the
lighteft fcreen, or ufe a dark glafs lighter than the
fcreens, and defigned for this particular purpofe} look
at the ftar diredtly through the tranfparent part of the
horizon-glafs j and keeping it there, move the index
till the moon’s image is brought into the filvered part
of the fame glafs. Make the quadrant librate gently
on the ftar’s ray, and the moon will appear to rife and
fall by the ftar : move the index between the librations,
until the moon’s enlightened limb is exa&ly touched
by the ftar, and then the obfervation is made. In
thefe operations, the plane of the quadrant muft alwrays
pafs through the two objects, the diftance of which is
to be obferved ; and for this purpofe it muft be placed
in various pofitions according to the fituation of the
objefts, which will foon be rendered eafy by prac¬
tice.
The obfervation being made, fomebody at the very
inftant that the operator calls muft obferve by the
watch the exa£t hour, minute, and quarter minute, if
there be no fecond hand, in order to find the apparent
time; and at the fame inftant, or as quick as poflible,
* two afliftants muft take the altitudes of thofe objedls
the diftance of which is obferved j after w’hich, the ob¬
fervations neceffary for finding the longitude are Com¬
pleted.
The Ephemeris (hows the moon’s diftance from the
fun, and likewife from proper ftars, to every three
hours of apparent time for the meridian of Greenwich $
and that the greater number of opportunities of obferv-
ing this luminary may be given, her diftance is gene¬
rally fet dowm from at le&ft one objeef on each fide of
her. Her diftance from the fun is fet dowm wTile it is
between 40 and 1 20 degrees ; fo that, by means of a
fextant, it may be obferved for two or three days after
her firft and before her laft quarter. When the moon
is between 40 and 90 degrees from the fun, her diftance
is fet down both from the fun and from a ftar on the
contrary fide : and, laftly, when the diftance is above
120 degrees, the diftance is fet down from tw'o ftars,
one on each fide of her. The diftance of the moon
from objedls on the eaft fide of her is found in the Ephe¬
meris in the 8th and 9th pages of the month ; and her
diftance from objects on the weft is found in the Ioth Long
and 1 ith pages of the month.
WThen the Ephemeris is ufed, the diftance of the
moon muft only be obferved from thofe ftars the di¬
ftance of which is fet down there ; and thefe afford a
ready means of knowing the ftar from which her di¬
ftance ought to be obferved. The obferver has then
nothing more to do than to fet his index to the di¬
ftance roughly computed at the apparent time, efti-
mated nearly for the meridian at Greenwich j after
which he is to look to the eaft or weft of the moon,
according as the diftance of the ftar is found in the
8th or 9th, or in the 10th or nth, pages of the
month •, and having found the moon upon the hori¬
zon-glafs, the ftar will eafily be found by fweeping
with the quadrant to the right or left, provided the-air
be clear and the ftar be in the line of the moon’s thort-
eft axis produced. The time at Greenwich is efti-
mated by turning into time the fuppofed longitude
from that place, and adding it to the apparent time
at the fhip, or fubtrafting it from it as cccafion re¬
quires. The diftance of the moon from the fun, or a
ftar, is roughly found at this time, by faying, As i8o
minutes (the number contained in three hours) is to
the difference in minutes between this nearly eftimated
time and the next preceding time fet down in the
Ephemeris j fo is the difference in minutes between the
diftance in the Ephemeris for the next preceding and
next following times, to a number of minutes ; which
being added to the next preceding diftance, or fub-
trafted from it, according as it is increafing^ or de-
creafing, will give the diftance nearly at the time the
obfervation is to be made, and to which the index mull
be fet.
An eafier method of finding the angular diftance is
by bringing the obje£ts nearly into contact in the
common wTay, and then fixing the index tight to a
certain degree and minute •, waiting until the objefls
are nearly in contafl, giving notice to the afliftants to
get ready with the altitudes, and when the objeifts are
exa&ly in contasft to call 'for the altitudes and the exaft
time by the w^atch. The obferver may then prepare
for taking another diftance, by fetting his index three
or four minutes backwards or forwards, as the objedls
happen to be receding from or approaching to each
other *, thus proceeding to take the diftance, altitudes,
and time by the watch, as before. "Ihus the obferver
may take as many diftances as he thinks proper $ but
four at the diftance of three minutes, or three at. the
diftance of four minutes, will at all times be fufficient.
Thus not only the eye of the obferver will be lefs fa¬
tigued, but he will likewife be enabled to manage his
inftrument with much greater facility in every direc¬
tion, a vertical one only excepted. If in taking the
diftances the middle one can be taken at any even di¬
vifion on the arch, fuch as a degree, or a degree and
20 or 40 minutes, that diftance will be independent of
the Nonius divilion, and confequently free of thofe
errors which frequently arife from the inequality of
that divifion in feveral parts of the graduated arch.
The obfervation ought always to be made about two
hours before or after noon 5 and the true time may be
found by the altitude of the fun taken at the precife
time of the diftance. If three diftances are taken,
' then
LON [2
Longitude, then find the time by the altitude correfponding with
V"“”"v ' the middle diftance j and thus the obfervation will be
fecured from any error arifing from the irregularity of
the going of the watch. As the time, however,
found by the altitude of a ftar cannot be depended up¬
on, becaufe of the uncertainty of the horizon in the
night, the beft wmy of determining the time for a night
obfervation will be by twTo altitudes of the fun ; one
taken on the preceding afternoon, before he is within
fix degrees of the horizon ; and the other on the next
morning, when he is more than fix degrees high. It
muft be obferved, how'ever, that in order to follow
thefe diredtions, it is neceffary that the atmofphere
fhould be pretty free from clouds ; otherwile the ob-
ferver muft take the obfervations at fuch times as he
Can beft obtain them.
2. To reduce the olferved Dijlance of the Sun or a
Star from the Moon to the true Di/lance, i. Turn the
longitude into time, and add it to the time at the {hip
if the longitude be weft, but fubtrad! it if it be eaft,
which will give the fuppofed time at Greenwich ; and
this we may call reduced time. 2. Find the neareft
noon or midnight both before and after the reduced
time in the feventh page of the month in the Ephemeris.
3. Take out the moon’s femidiameter and horizontal
parallaxes correfponding to thefe noons and midnights,
and find their differences. Then fay, As 12 hours is
to the moon’s femidiameter in 1 2 hours, fo is the redu¬
ced time to a number of feconds; which, either added
to or fubtradled from the moon’s femidiameter at the
noon or midnight juft mentioned, according as it is in-
creafing or decreafing, wdll give her apparent femidia¬
meter 3 to which add the correftion from Table VIII.
of the Ephemeris, and the fum will be her true femidia¬
meter at the reduced time. And as 12 hours is to the
difference of the moon’s horizontal parallax in I 2 hours,
fo is the reduced time to a fourth number 3 which, be¬
ing added to or fubtrafted from the moon’s horizontal
parallax at the noon or midnight before the reduced
time, according as it is increafing or decreafing, the
fum or difference wall be the moon’s horizontal parallax
at the reduced time. 4. If the reduced time be nearly
any even part of 12 hours, viz. -gth, |th, &c. thefe
parts of the difference may be taken, and either added
or fubtraffed according to the direftions already given,
without being at the trouble of working by the rule of
proportion. 5. To the obferved altitude of the fun’s
Iowrer limb add the difference betwixt his femidiameter
and dip 3 and that fum will be his apparent altitude.
6. From the fun’s refradlion take his parallax in alti¬
tude, and the remainder will be the correftion of the
fun’s altitude. 7. From the ftar’s obferved altitude take
the dip of the horizon, and the remainder will be the
apparent altitude. 8. The refratlion of a ftar will be
the corre61ion of its altitude. 9. Take the difference
between the moon’s fem diameter and dip, and add it
to the obferved altitude if her lowTer limb was taken, or
fubtratft it if her upper limb was taken 3 and the fum or
difference will be the apparent altitude of her centre.
to. hrom the proportional logarithm of the moon’s ho¬
rizontal parallax, taken out of the nautical almanack

tude 3 from which take her refraftion, and the remain¬
der will be the correftion of the moon’s altitude. 11.
To the obferved diftance of the moon from a ftar add
her femidiameter if the neareft limb be taken, but fub-
traft it if the fartheft limb was taken, and the fum or
difference will be the apparent diftance. 12. To the
obferved diftance of the fun and moon add both their
femidiameters, and the fum will be the apparent di¬
ftance of their centres.
3. To find the true Difance of the Objects, having
their apparent Altitudes and Dijlances. 1. To the pro¬
portional logarithm of the correction of the fun or
ftar’s altitude, add the logarithmic cofine of the fun
or liar’s apparent altitude 3 the logarithmic fine of the
apparent diftance of the moon from the fun or ftar )
and the logarithmic cofecant of the moon’s apparent
altitude. The fum of thefe, rejefting 30 from the
index, will be the proportional logarithm of the firft
angle. 2. To the proportional logarithm of the cor-
redion of the fun or ftar’s altitude, add the loga¬
rithmic cotangent of the fun or ftar’s apparent alti¬
tude, and the logarithmic tangent of the apparent
diftance of the moon from the fun or ftar. The fum
of thefe, rejedling 20 in the index, will be the pro¬
portional logarithm of the fecond angle. 3. Take
the difference between the firft and fecond angles,
adding it to the apparent diftance if it be lefs than
93, and the firft angle be greater than the fecond 3
but fubtradling it if the fecond be greater than the
firft. If the diftance be greater than 90, the fum of
the angles muft be added to the apparent diftance,
which will give the diftance corrected for the refrac¬
tion of the fun or ftar. 4. To the proportional lo¬
garithm of the corredlion of the moon’s altitude add
the logarithmic cofine of her apparent altitude 3 the
logarithmic fine of the diftance corredted for the fun
or ftar’s refradtion and the logarithmic cofecant of
the fun’s or ftar’s apparent altitude. The fum, rejedl-
ing 30 in the index, will be the proportional loga¬
rithm of the third angle. 5. To the proportional
logarithm of the corredfion of the moon’s apparent
altitude, add the logarithmic cotangent of her appa¬
rent altitude, and the tangent of the diftance cor-
redled for the fun or ftar’s refradtion 3 their fum, re-
jedling 20 in the index, will be the proportional lo¬
garithm of the fourth angle. 6. Take the difference
between the third and fourth angles, and fubtradl it
from the diftance corredled for the fun or ftar’s re-
fradtion if lefs than 90, and the third angle be great¬
er than the fourth 3 or add it to the diftance if the fourth
angle be greater than the third : but if the diftance be
more than 90, the fum of the angles muft be fubtradl-
ed from it, to give the diftance corredled for the fun
or ftar’s refradlion, and the principal effedls of the
moon’s parallax. 7. In Table XX. of the Ephemeris,
look for the diftance corredled for the fun and ftar’s
refradlion, and the moon’s parallax in the top column,
and the corredlion of her altitude in the left-hand fide
column 3 take out the number of feconds that Hand
under the former, and oppofite to the latter. Look
again in the fame table for the corredled diftance in
the top column, and the principal effedls of the moon’s
parallax in the left-hand fide column, and take out the
number of i’econds. The difference between thefe two
F f uumbers
LON [2
Longitude, numbers muft be added to tbe corrected diftance if lefs
^—    than 90, but fubtrafted from it if greater j and the
fum or dift'erence will be the true diilance.
4. 2b determine the Longitude after having obtain¬
ed the true Dijlance. Look in the Ephemeris among
the diilances of the objebfs for the computed diftance
betwixt the moon and the other object obferved on
the given day. If it be found there, the time at
Greenwich wall be at the top of the column j but if
it falls between tw'O diftances in the Ephemeris which
ftand immediately before and after it, and alfo the
difference between the diftance Handing before and
the computed diftance j then take the proportional
logarithms of the firft and fecond differences, and the
difference between thele two logarithms will be the
proportional logarithm of a number of hours, minutes,
and feconds ; which being added to the time ftanding
over the firft diftance, will give the true time at Green¬
wich. Or it may be found by faying, As the firft
difference is to three hours, fo is the fecond difference
to a proportional part of time : which being added as
above directed, will give the time at Greenwich. The
difference between Greenwich time and that at the
ftiip, turned into longitude, will be that at the time
the obfervations were made j and wall be eaft if the
ijme at the ftiip Is greateft, but weft if it is leaft.
Having given thele general diredions, we ftiall next
proceed to ihow fome particular examples of finding the
longitude at fea by all the different methods in w'hich
it is ufually tried. ^
I. Tofind the Longitude by Computation from the Ship's
Courfe.—Were it poflible to keep an accurate account
of the diftance the flap has run, and to meafure it ex-
f See Log, a^]y by the log * or any other means, then both lati-
Perpetual. tu(je anj iong|tuc}e vvould eafily be found by fettling
the Ihip’s account to that time. For the courfe and
diflance being knowm, the difference of latitude and
departure is readily found by the Traverfe Table : and
the difference of longitude being known, the true
longitude and latitude will alfo be known. A variety
of caufes, however, concur to render this computa¬
tion inaccurate $ particularly the Ihip’s continual de-
fle&ion from the courfe fet by her playing to the
right and left round her centre of gravity : the un¬
equal care of thofe at the helm, and the diftance fup-
pofed to be failed being erroneous, on account of
ftormy feas, unfteady winds, currents, &c. for which
it feems impoffxble to make any allowance. The place
of the Ihip, however, is judged of by finding the la¬
titude every day, if poflible, by obfervations j and if
the latitude found by obfervation agrees with that by
the reckoning, it is prefumed that the (hip’s place is
properly determined ; but if they difagree, it is con¬
cluded that the account of the longitude ftands in need
of correflion, as the latitude by obfervation is always
to be depended upon.
Currents very often occafion errors in the compu¬
tation of a fhip’s place. The caufes of thefe in the
great depths of the ocean are not well known, though
many of the motions near the ftrore can be accounted
for. It is fuppofed that fome of thofe in the great
oceans are owing to the tide following the moon, and
a certain libration of the waters arifing from thence }
likewife that the unfettled nature of thefe currents
may be owing to the changes in the moon’s declina-
26 ] LON
tion. In the torrid zone, how'ever, a confiderable cur- Longitude,
rent Is occafioned by the trade winds, the motion be- '’““"’V" 1
ing conftantly to the w'eft, at the rate of eight or ten
miles per day. At the extremities of the trade wands
or near the 30th degree of north or fouth latitude,
the currents are probably compounded ol this motion
to the weftward, and of one towards the equator j
whence all (hips failing within thefe limits ought to
allow a courfe each day for the current.
When the error is fuppofed to have been occafioned
by a current, it ought if poflible to be tried whether
the cafe is fo or not $ or we muft make a reafonable
eftimate of its drift and courfe. Then with the fel¬
ting and drift, as a courfe and diftance, find the difo
ference of latitude and departure ; with which the
dead reckoning is to be increafed or diminiflied ; and
if the latitude thus corrected agrees with that by ob¬
fervation, the departure thus corrected may be fafely
taken as true, and thus the (hip’s place with regard to
the longitude determined.
Exam. Suppofe a ftiip in 24 hours finds, by her
dead reckoning, that (he has made 96 miles of dif¬
ference of latitude north and 38 miles of departure
weft ) but by obfervation finds her difference of lati¬
tude 112, and on trial that there is a current which
in 24 hours makes a difference of 16 miles latitude
north and 10 miles of departure eaft : Required the
(hip’s departure.

Here the dead reckoning corredted by the current gives
the difference of latitude 112 miles, which is the fame
as that found by obfervation j whence the departure 28^
is taken as the true one.
When the error is fuppofed to arife from the courfes
and diftances, we muft obferve, that if the difference
of latitude is much more than the departure, or the
direft courfe has been within three points of the me¬
ridian, the error is moft probably in the diftance. But
if the departure be much greater than the difference
of latitude, or the direft courfe be within three points
of the parallel, or more than five points from the me¬
ridian, the error is probably to be aferibed to the
courfe. But if the courfes in general are near the mid¬
dle of the quadrant, the error may be either in the
courfe, or in the diftance, or both. This method ad¬
mits of three cafes.
x. When, by the dead reckoning, the difference of
latitude is more than once and a half the departure j
or when the courfe is lefs than three points : Find
the courfe to the difference of latitude and departure.
With this courfe and the meridional difference of la¬
titude by obfervation, find the difference of longitude.
2. When the dead reckoning is more than once
and a half the difference of latitude j or when the
courfe is more than five points : Find the courfe and
diflance, w’ith the difference of latitude by obfervation,
and departure by account j then with the co-middle
latitude by obfervation, and departure by account, find
the difference of longitude.

3. When the difference of latitude and departure
by account is nearly equal, or the direct courfe is be¬
tween three and five points of the meridian : Find the
courfe with the difference of latitude and departure by
account fince the laft obfervation. With this courfe
and the difference of latitude by obfervation find ano¬
ther departure. Take half the fum of thefe departures
for the true one. With the true departure and differ-
ance of latitude by obfervation find the true courfe;
then with the true courfe and meridional difference of
latitude find the difference of longitude.
2. To find the Longitude at Sea by a Variation-chart
Dr Halley having colle&ed a great number of obfer-
vations on the variation of the needle in many parts
of the world ; by that means was enabled to draw
certain lines on Mercator’s chart, (hewing the varia¬
tion in all the places over which they paffed in the
year 1700, at which time he firft publifhed the chart;
whence the longitude of thofe places might be found
by the chart, provided its latitude and variation were
given. The rule is, Draw a parallel of latitude on the
chart through the latitude found by obfervation ; and
the point where it cuts the curved line marked with the
variation that was obferved will be the (hip’s place.
Exam. A (hip finds by obfervation the latitude to
be 18° 20' north, and the variation of the compafs to
be 40 tveft. Required the (hip’s place.—Lay a ruler
over 18° 20' north parallel to the equator; and the
point where its edge cuts the curve of 4* weft varia¬
tion gives the (hip’s place, which will be found in about
27® 10' weft from London.
This method of finding the longitude, however, is
attended with two inconveniences. 1. That when the
variation lines run eaft or weft, or nearly fo, it cannot
be applied ; though as this happens only in certain parts
of the world, a variation chart may be of great ufe for
the reft. Even in thofe places indeed where the varia¬
tion curves do run eaft or wTeft, they may be of con-
jiderable ufe in correcting the latitude when meridian
obfervations cannot be had; which frequently happens
on the northern coafts of America, the Weftern ocean,
and about Newfoundland ; for if the variation can be
found exactly, the eaft and weft curve anfwering to it
will (how the latitude But, 2. The variation itfelf is
fubjeCt to continual change ; whence a chart, though
ever fo perfeCt at firft, muft in time become totally ufe-
lefs ; and hence the charts conftruCted by Dr Halley,
though of great utility at their firft publication, became
at length almoft entirely ufelefs. A newr one w^as pub¬
lifhed in 1746 by Meffrs Mountaine and Dodfon,
which was fo well received, that in 1756 they again
drew variation lines for that year, and publiftied a third
chart the year following. They alfo prefented to the
Royal Society a curious paper concerning the variation
of the magnetic needle, with a fet of tables annexed, con¬
taining the refult of more than 50,000 obfervations, in
fix periodical reviews from the year 1700 to 1756 in-
clufive, adapted to every five degrees of latitude and
longitude in the more frequented oceans 5 all of which
were publifhed in the Philofophical Tranfaftions for
I757-
3. To find the Longitude by the Sun's Declination.—
Having made fuch obfervations on the fun as may
enable us to find his declination at the place, take the
difference between this computed declination and that
(hown at London by the Ephemeris ; from which take
alfo the daily difference of declination at that time ;
then fay, as the daily difference of declination is to the
above found difference, fo is 360 degrees to the dif¬
ference of longitude. In this method, however, a
fmall error in the declination will make a great one in
the longitude.
4. To find the Longitude by the Moon's culminating.—
Seek in the Ephemeris for the time of her coming to
the meridian on the given day and on the day follow¬
ing, and take their difference ; alfo take the difference
betwixt the times of culminating on the fame day as
found in the ephemeris and as obferved ; then fay, as
the daily difference in the ephemeris is to the difference
between the ephemeris and obfervation ; fo is 360 de¬
grees to the difference of longitude. In this method
alfo a fmall difference in the culmination will occafion
a great one in the longitude.
5. By Eclipfes of the Moon.—This is done much ia
the fame manner as by the eclipfes of Jupiter’s fatel-
lites : For if, in two or more diftant places where an
eclipfe of the moon is vifible, we carefully obferve the
times of the beginning and ending, the number of di¬
gits eclipfed, or the time when the ffradow touches fome
remarkable fpot, or when it leaves any particular fpot
on the moon, the difference of the times when the ob¬
fervations were made will give the difference of longi¬
tude. Phenomena of this kind, however, occur too
feldom to be of much ufe.
6. In the 76th volume of the Philofophical Tranf-
aftions, Mr Edward Pigot gives a very particular ac¬
count of his method of determining the longitude
and latitude of York ; in which he alfo recommends
the method of determining the longitude of places by
obfervations of the moon's trunfit over the meridian.
The inftruments ufed in his obfervations were a gridiron
pendulum clock, a two feet and a half refledlor, an
eighteen inch quadrant made by Mr Bird, and a tranfil
in ft rumen t made by Mr S’(Ton.
By thefe inftruments an obfervation wras made, ou
the 10th of September 1783, of the occultation of a
ftar of the ninth magnitude by the moon, during an
eclipfe of that planet, at York and Paris. Befides
this, there were obfervations made of the immerfions
of <p Aquarii and S Pificium ; the refult of all w’hich
was, that between Greenwich and York the difference
of meridians was 4' 27".
In 1783, Mr Pigot informs us, that he thought of
finding the difference of meridians by obferving the
meridian right afeenfions of the moon’s limb. This he
thought had been quite original : but he found it after¬
wards in the Nautical Almanack for 1769, and in
1784 read a pamphlet on the fame fubjefl by the abbe
Toaldo ; but (till found that the great exadtnefs of this
method was not fufpe&ed ; though he is convinced that
it muft foon be univerfally adopted in preference to that
from the firft fatellite of Jupiter.
After giving a number -of obfervations on the fatel-
lites of Jupiter, he concludes, that the exatlnefs ex*
pefled from obfervations, even on the firft fatellite, is
much over-rated. “ Among the various objeftions
(fays he), there is one I have often experienced, and
rvhich proceeds folely from the difpofition of the eye,
that of feeing more diftinftly at one time than another.
It may not be improper alfo to mention, that the obfer-

Loirgitnde. vaticn I fhould have relied on as the beft, that of
'' v Augutf 30. 1785, marked excellent, is one of thofe moft
dillant from the truth.”
After giving a number of obfervations on the eclipfe
of the moon September 10. 1783, our author concludes,
that the eclipfes of the moon’s fpots are in general too,
much neglected, and that it might be relied upon much
more were the following circumftances attended to:
I. To be particular in fpecifying the clearnefs of the
Iky. 2. To choofe fuch fpots as are w'ell defined, and
leave no hefitation as to the part eclipfed. 3. That
every obferver ihould ufe, as far as poflible, telefcopes
equally powerful, or at leaft let the magnifying powers
be the fame. “ A principal objedtion (fays he) may
ftill be urged, viz. the difficulty of diftinguilhing the
true ihadow from the penumbra. Was this obviated,
I believe the refults would be more exadl than from Ju¬
piter’s firft fatellite : Undoubtedly the fliadow appears
better defined if magnified little ; but I am much in¬
clined to think, that, with high magnifying powers,
there is greater certainty of choofing the fame part of
the ihadow, which perhaps is more than a fufficient
compenfation for the lofs of diftindlnefs.”
The following rule for meridian obfervations of the
moon’s limb is next laid down : “ The increafe of the
moon’s right afcenfion in twelve hours (or any given
time found by computation), is to 12 hours as the
increafe of the moon’s right afcenfion between twro
places found by obfervation is to the difference of meri¬
dians.

“ Thefe eafy .obfervations and fhort redudfion (fays
Mr Pigoi) are the whole of the bufinefs. Inflead of
computing the moon’s right afcenfion for I 2 hours,
I have conftantly taken it from the Nautical Alma¬
nacks, wffiich give it fufficiently exadl, provided fome
attention be paid to the increafe or decreafe of the
njocn’s motion. Were the following circumhances
attended to, the refults would be undoubtedly much Longitude,
more exadt.
“ 1. Compare the obfervations with the fame made
in feveral other places. 2. Let feveral and the fame
ffars be obferved at thefe places. 3. Such liars as are
neareft in right afcenfion and declination to the moon
are infinitely preferable. 4. It cannot be too ftrongly
urged, to get, as near as poffible, an equal number of
obfervations of each limb, to take a mean of each fet,
and then a mean of both means. This will in a great
meafure corredt the error of telefcopes and fight.
5. The adjullment of the telefcopes to the eye of the
obferver before the obfervation is alfo very neceffary,
as the fight is fubjedl to vary. 6. A principal error
proceeds from the obfervation of the moon’s limb,
wffiich may be confiderably leffened, if certain little
round fpots near each limb were alfo obferved in fettled
oblervatories j in which cafe the libration of the moon
will perhaps be a confideration. <7. When the differ¬
ence of meridians, or of the latitudes of places, is very
confiderable, the change of the moon’s diameter be¬
comes an equation.
“ Though fuch are the requifites to ufe this method
with advantage, only one or two of them have been em¬
ployed in the obfervations that I have reduced. Two
thirds of thefe obfervations had not even the fame liars
obferved at Greenwich and York j and yet none of the
refults, except a doubtful one, differ 15" from the
mean j therefore I think we may expebt a Hill greater
exablnefs, perhaps within I o", if the above particulars
be attended to.
“ When the fame liars are not obferved, it is necef¬
fary for the obfervers at both places to compute their
right afcenfion from tables, in order to get the appa¬
rent right afcenfion of the moon’s limb. Though
this is not fo fatisfablory as by actual obfervation, llill
the difference will be trilling, provided the liar’s right
afeenfions are accurately fettled. I am alfo of opi¬
nion, that the fame method can be put in pradtice by
travellers with little trouble, and a tranfit inltrument,
conltrubted fo as to fix up with facility in any place.
It is not neceffary, perhaps, that the inltrument Ihould
be perfebtly in the meridian for a few feconds of time,
provided liars, nearly in the fame parallel of declina¬
tion with the moon, are obferved •, nay, I am inclined
to think, that if the inltrument deviates even a quarter
or half a degree, or more, fufficient exabtnefs can be
attained j as a table might be computed, Ihowing the
moon’s parallax and motion for fuch deviation •, which
lalt may eafily be found by the well-known method of
obferving liars whofe difference of decimation is con¬
fiderable.
“ As travellers very feldom meet with fituations to
obferve liars near-the pole, or find a proper objebt for *
determining the error of the line of collimation, I
Ihall recommend the following method as original.—
Having computed the apparent right afcenfion of
four, fix, or more liars, which have nearly the fame
parallel of declination, obferve half of them with the
inllrument inverted, and the other half when in its
right pofition. If the difference of right afeenfions
between each fet by obfervation agrees with the com¬
putation, there is no error j but if they difagree, half-*
that difagreement is the error of the line of collima¬
tion. The fame obfervations may alfo ferve to deter¬
mine,.
LON [2
Longitude, mine, whether the diftances of the correfponding wires
-V’—' are equal. In cafe of neceflity, each limb of the fun
might be obferved in the fame manner, though proba¬
bly with lefs precifion. By a Angle trial I made above
two years ago, the refult was much more exadt
than I expedled. Mayer’s catalogue of ftars will
prove of great ufe to thofe that adopt the above me¬
thod.—I am rather furprifed that the immerfions of
known liars of the fixth and feventh magnitude, be¬
hind the dark limb of the moon, are not conftantly ob-
ferved in hxed obfervatories, as they would frequent¬
ly be of great ufe.
The annexed rule for finding the (hip’s place, with
the mifcellaneous obfervations on different methods,
were drawn up by Mr John M‘Lean of Edinburgh.
1. With regard to determining the (hip’s place by the
help of the courfe and dillance failed, the following rule
may be applied.—it will be found as expeditious as any
of the common methods by the middle latitude or meri¬
dional parts and is in fome refpetts preferable, as the
common tables of fines and tangents only are requi-
fite in applying it.—Let a and b be the diifances of
two places from the lame pole in degrees, or their com¬
plete latitude; c the angle which a meridian makes
with the rhumb line pafling through the places; and L
the angle formed by their meridians, or the difference
of longitude in minutes : then A and B being the lo¬
garithmic tangents oi ^ a and i S the fine of C, and
S the fine of (C-j-0> we have the following e-
quation: L~ (a). Alfo, from a well known
O —o
property of the rhumb line, we have the following
equation :
S-j_E^:R-}-D, where S is the logarithmic cofine of
C, E the logarithm of the length of the rhumb line, or
diftance, D the logarithm of the minute’s difference of
latitude, and R the logarithm of the radius.
By the help of thefe two equations, we {hall have
am eafy folution of the feveral cafes to which the
middle latitude, or meridional parts, are commonly ap¬
plied.
Exam. A (hip from a port in latitude 56° N*fails
S. W. by W. till (he arrives at the latitude of 40® N :
Required the difference of longitude ?
Here fl=34#, b=so°, 0=56° 15", A=r9.43534,
B—9.56107, S':=9.91993o8, 8=9.9198464; there¬
fore, L=--^— — 897 the minutes differ-
’ S'—b 844
ence of longitude. Alfo, 8=9.74474, 0=2.98227;
therefore E= R-J-D—S —3.23753, to which the na¬
tural number is 1728, the miles in the rhumb line fail¬
ed over.
2. The common method of finding the difference
of longitude made good upon feveral courfes and di-
dances, by means of the difference of latitude and de¬
parture made good upon the feveral courfes, is not ac¬
curately true.
For example : If a (hip (hould fail due fouth 600
miles, from a port in 6o° north latitude, and then due
weft 600 miles, the difference of longitude found by the
29 ] LON
common methods of folution would be 1053 ; whereas Longitede.^
the true difterence of longitude is only 933? lefs than
the former by 120 miles, which is more than one eighth
of the whole. Indeed, every confiderable alteration in
the courfe will produce a very fenlible error in the dif¬
ference of longitude. Though, when the feveral rhumb
lines failed over are nearly in the fame direction, the
error in longitude will be but (mall.
The reafon of this will eafily appear from the annexed
figure, in which the (hip is fuppoled to fail from Z to
A, along the rhumb lines ZB, BA; for if the meri¬
dians PZ,PkoeBL be drawn ; and very near the latter
other two meridians PhlD, Pmn ; and likewife the pa¬
rallels of latitude Bn, De, mo, hk ; then it is plain
that De is greater than hk (tor De is to hk as the
fine of DP to the fine of hP) : and fince this is the
cafe everywhere, the departure correfponding-to the
diftance BZ and courfe BZC, will be greater t an
the departure to the diftance oZ and courfe oZC.
And in the fame manner, we prove that nB is great¬
er than mo; and confequently, the departure corre¬
fponding to the diftance AB, and courfe ABL, is
greater than the departure to the diftance Ao, and
courfe AoL. Wherefore, the fam of the turn depar¬
tures correiponding to the courfes ABL and BZC,
and to the diftances AB and BZ, is greater than the
departure correfoonding to the diftance AZ and
courfe AZC : therefore the courfe anfwering to this
fum as a departure, and CZ as a difference or latitude,
(AC being the parallel of latitudes palling through
A), will be greater than the true courfe AZC made
good upon the whole. And hence the difference of
longitude found by the common rules will be greater
then the true difference of longitudes ; and the error
will be greater or lefs according as BA deviates more
Or lefs from the direition of BZ.

3. Of determining the drip’s longitude by lunar ob¬
fervations.
Several rules for this purpofe have been lately pub-
lifhed, the principal objedl of vrhLh feems to have been
TO
(a) Ago B fignifies the difference between A and B.
LON
Longitude., to abbreviate the computations requifits for determin-
the true diftance of the fun or ftar from the moon’s
centre. This, however, fhould have certainly been
lefs attended to than the inveftigation of a folution, in
which confiderable errors in the data may produce a
fmall error in the required diftance. When either of
the luminaries has a fmall elevation, its altitude will
be affeded by the variablenefs of the atmofphere;
likewife the altitude, as given by the quadrant, will
be affeded by the inaccuracy of the inftrument, and
the uncertainty neceffarily attending all obfervations
made at fea. The fum of thefe errors, when they all
tend the fame way, may be fuppofed to amount to at
lead: one minute rt altitude j which, in many cafes, ac¬
cording to the common rules for computing the true
diftance, will produce an error of about 30 minutes in
the longitude. Thus, in the example given by Monf.
Callet, in the Tables Fortatives, if we fuppofe an error
of one minute in the fun’s altitude, or call it 6° 26' 34",
inftead of 6° 27' 34"; we fhall find the alteration in
diftance according to his rule to be 54", producing an
€rror of about 27 minutes in the longitude \ for the
angle at the fun will be found, in the fpherical triangle
whofe fides are the complement of the fun’s altitude,
complement of the rUoon’s altitude, and obferved di-
llance, to be about 26° ; and as radius is to the cofine of
26°, fo is 16 the fuppofed error in altitude, to 54" the
alteration in diftance. Perhaps the only method of de¬
termining the diftance, fo as not to be affedled by the
errors of altitude, is that by firft finding the angles at
the fun and moon, and by the help of them the correc¬
tions of diftance for parallax and refradlion. The rule
is as follows :
Add together the complement of the moon’s appa¬
rent altitude, the complement of the fun’s apparent al¬
titude, and the apparent diftance of centres 5 from half
the fum of thefe fubftradl the complement of the fun’s
altitude, and add togecher the logarithmic cofecant
of the complement of the moon’s altitude, the loga¬
rithmic cofecant of the apparent diftance of centres,
the logarithmic fine of the half fum, and the logarith¬
mic fine of the remainder ; and half the fum of thefe
four logarithms, after rejecting 20 from the index,
[ 230- ]
LON
is the logarithmic cofine of half the angle at the Longitude,
moon. —j
As radius is to the cofine of the angle at the moon ;
fo is the difference between the moon’s parallax and
refradtion in altitude to a corredlion of diftance; which
is to be added to the apparent diftance of centres when
the angle at the moon is obtufe; but to be fubtradfed
when that angle is acute, in order to have the diftance
once corrected.
In the above formula, if the word fun be changed
for moon, and vice verfa, wherever thefe terms occur, we
fhall find a fecond corredtion of diftance to be applied
to the diftance, once corredted by fubtradtion when the
angle at the fun is obtufe, but by addition wdien that
angle is acute, and the remainder or fum is the true di-
ftance nearly.
In applying this rule, it will be fufficient to ufe the
complement, altitude, and apparent diftances of cen¬
tres, true to the neareft minute only, as a fmall errof
in the angles at the fun and moon will very little affedfc
the corredtions of diftances.
If D be the computed diftance in feconds, d the
difference between the moon’s parallax and refradfion
in altitude, S the fine of the angle at the moon, and
</* S*
R the radius; then —will be the third corredlion
2DR
of diftance, to be added to the diftance twice corredl-
ed : But it is plain, from the nature of this corrediion,
that it may be always rejedled, except when the diftance
D is very fmall, and the angle at the moon nearly equal
to 90®.
This folution is likewife of ufe in finding the true
diftance of a ftar from the moon, by changing the word
fun into far, and ufing the refradlion of the ftar, inftead
of the difference between the refradlion and parallax in
altitude of the fun, in finding the fecond corredlion of
diftance.
Ex. Given the obferved diftance of a ftar from the
centre of the moon, 50° 8' 41" ; the moon’s altitude,
J5° 58' 5,/» the ftar’s altitude, 190 18' 5"; and the

LONGOMONTANUS, Christian, a learned a-
ftronomer, born in a village of Denmark in 1562. He
was the fon of a ploughman •, and was obliged to fuffer
during his ftudies all the hardfhips to w’hich he could
be expofed, dividing his time, like the philofopher Cle-
anthes, between the cultivation of the ^arth and the
leflbns he received from the minifter of the place. At
laft, when he w^as 15, he ftole away from his family,
and went to Wiburg, w’here there wras a college, in
which he fpent 11 years $ and though he was obliged
to earn a livelihood, he applied himfelf to ftudy with
fuch ardour, that among other fciences he learned the
mathematics in great perfection. He afterwards went
to Copenhagen j where the profeffors of that univerfity
in a ftiort time conceived fo high an opinion of him,
that they recommended him to the celebrated Tycho
Brahe. Longomontanus lived eight years with that
famous aftronomer, and wras of great fervice to him in
his obfervations and calculations. At length, being
extremely defirous of obtaining a profeffor’s chair in
Denmark, Tycho Brahe confented, though with fome
difficulty, to deprive himfelf of his fervice ; gave him
a difcharge, filled with the higheft teftimonies of his
efteem ; and furnifhed him with money for the expence
of his long journey. He obtained a profefforfhip of
mathematics in the univerfity of Copenhagen in 1605 ;
and difcharged the duty of it worthily till his death,
which happened in 1647. He wrote many learned
works 5 amufed himfelf with endeavouring to fquare the
circle, and pretended that he had made that difcovery j
but Dr John Pell, an Englifh mathematician, attack¬
ed him warmly on that fubjeft, and proved that he
was miftaken.

with their flinging-tongs, and beat it wdth iron fledges
upon an iron plate near the fire, that fo it may not
fall to pieces, but be in a condition to be carried un¬
der the hammer. It is then placed under the hammer,
and a little water being drawn to make the hammer
move but foftly, it is beat very gently, and by this

cellor, Isfc. The word is Saxon, but abbreviated from
two fyllables into one; for it was originally Hlaford,
which by dropping the afpiration became Laford,
and afterwards by contiadlion Lord. “ The etymo¬
logy of the word (fays J. Coates) is well worth ob-
ferving ; for it was compofed of hlaf “ a loaf of
bread,” and ford “ to give or afford fo that Hla¬
ford, now Lord, implies “ a giver of bread j” becaufe,
in thofe ages, fuch great men kept extraordinary
houfes, and fed all the poor ; for wdiich reafon they
were called givers of bread, a thing now much out of
date, great men being fond of letaining the title, but
few regarding the pradlice for which it was firit given.

Houfe of Lords, one of the three eftates of parlia¬
ment, and compofed of the Lords Spiritual and Tem¬
poral.
1. The Spiritual Lords confiftof two archbilhops and
24 bifhops; and, at the diffolution of monafteries by
Henry VIII. confifted likewife of 26 mitred abbots
and tw*o priors; a very confiderable body, and in
thofe times equal in number to the temporal nobility.
All thefe hold, or are fuppofed to hold, certain ancient
baronies under the king : for William the Conqueror
thought proper to change the fpiritual tenor of frank¬
almoign or free alms, under which the bilhops held
their lands during the Saxon government, into the
feodal or Norman tenure by barony ; which fubjedbed
their eftates to all civil charges and affeffments, from
which they were before exempt ; and in right of fuc-
ceffion to thofe baronies, w'hich were unalienable from
their refpedlive dignities, the biftiops and abbots wrere
allowed their feats in the houfe of lords. But though
thefe lords fpiritual are in the eye of the law' a diftindl
eftate from the lords temporal, and are fo diftinguiftied
in moft of our ads of parliament ; yet in pradice they
are ufually blended together under the name ot the lords:
they intermix in their votes, and the majority of fuch
intermixture joins both eftates. And from this want
of a feparate affembly, and feparate negative of the
prelates, fome waiters have argued very cogently, that
the lords fpiritual and temporal are now in reality only
one eftate : which is unqueftionably true in every ef-
fedual fenfe, though the ancient diitindion between
them (fill nominally continues. For if a bill ftiould
pafs their houfe, there is no doubt of its validity,
though every lord fpiritual (hould vote againft it; of
which Selden and Sir Edward C’oke give many in-
ftances : as, on the other hand, doubtlefs it would be
equally good, if the lords temporal prefent were infe¬
rior to the biihops in number, and every one of thofe
temporal lords gave his vote to rejed the bill; though
this Sir Edward Coke feems to doubt of.

Anne, there was an inifance of creating no lefs than

of King George I. a bill paffed the houfe of lords, and
was countenanced by the then miniftry, for limiting
the number of the peerage. This wras thought by
fome to prcmife a great acquifition to the conftitution,
by reftraining the prerogative from gaining the afcen-
dant in that auguft alterably, by pouring in at plea-
fure an unlimited number of neiv-created lords. But
the bill wjas ill relilhed, and mifcarried in the houfe of

to keep the avenues to the other houfe as open and eafy
as poffible.
The dillindlion of ranks and honours is necefiary in
every w7ell governed ftate : in order to reward fuch as
are eminent for their fervices to the public, in a manner
the moft delirable to individuals, and yet without burden
to the community ; exciting thereby an ambitious yet
laudable ardour and generous emulation in others. And
emulation, or virtuous ambition, is a fpring of aftion
which, however dangerous or invidious in a mere repu¬
blic or under a defpotic fway, will certainly be attended
with good effects under a free monarchy ; tvhere, with-
out deftroying its exiftence, its exceffes may be conti¬
nually reftrained by that fuperior power from which
all honour is derived. Such a fpirit, when nationally
diffufed, gives life and vigour to the community ; it
fets all the wheels of government in motion, which,
under a wife regulator, may be direfted to any bene-
# ficial purpofe ; and thereby every individual may be
made fubfervient to the public good, wdiile he prin¬
cipally means to promote his own particular views.
A body of nobility is alfo more particularly neceffary
in our mixed and compounded conftitution, in order to
fupport the rights of both the crown and the people,
by forming a barrier to withftand the encroachments
of both. It creates and preferves that gradual fcale
of dignity which proceeds from the peafant to the
prince ; riling like a pyramid from a broad founda¬
tion, and diminilhing to a point as it rifes. It is this
afeending and contrafling proportion that adds liabi¬
lity to any government ; for when the departure is
fudden from one extreme to another, wTe may pro¬
nounce that ftate to be precarious. The nobility
therefore are the pillars, which are reared from
among the people, more immediately to fupport the
throne ; and, if that falls, they muft alfo be buried
under its ruins. Accordingly, when in the laft cen¬
tury the commons had determined to extirpate mo¬
narchy, they alfo voted the houfe of lords to be ufelefs
and dangerous. And fince titles of nobility are thus
expedient in the ftate, it is allb expedient that their
owners Ihould form an independent and feparate
branch of the legiflature. If they were confounded
wdth the mafs of the people, and like them had only
a vote in elefling reprefentatives, their privileges would
foon be borne down and overwhelmed by the popular
torrent, which, would efteffually level all diftinfHons.
It is therefore highly neceffary that the body of nobles
Ihould have a diftinft affemblv, diftinfl deliberations,

As to the peculiar laws and cuftoms relating to the
houfe of lords : One very ancient privilege is that de¬
clared by the charter of the foreft, confirmed in parlia¬
ment 9 Hen. III. ; viz. that every lord fpiritual or
temporal fummoned to parliament, and pafting through
the king’s forefts, may, both in going and returning,
kill one or two of the king’s deer without warrant ;
in view of the forefter if he be prelent^ or on bloxving
a horn if he be abfent ; that he may not feem to take
the king’s venifon by Health.
In the next place, they have a right to be attended,
and conftantly are, by the judges of the court of
king’s bench and common pleas, and fuch of the
barons of the exchequer as are of the degree of the
coif, or have been made ferjeants at law ; asTikewffe
by the king’s learned counfel, being ferjeants, and by
the mailers of the court of chancery ; for their ad¬
vice in point of law, and for the greater dignity of
their proceedings. The fecretaries of ftate, wbth the
attorney and folicitor general, were alfo ufed to attend
the houfe of peers, and have to this day (together
with the judges, &lc.) their regular writs of fummons
iffued out at the beginning of every parliament, ad trac-
tandum et conjilium impendendum, though not ad confen-
tienduju, but, whenever of late years they have been
members of the houfe of commons, their attendance
here hath fallen into difufe.
Another privilege is, that every peer, by licenfe
obtained from the king, may make another lord of
parliament his proxy, to vote for him in his abfence :
A privilege, which a member of the other houfe can
by no means have, as he is himfelf but a proxy for a
multitude of other people.
Each peer has alfo a right, by leave of the houfe,
when a vote paffes contrary to his fentiments, to en¬
ter his diffent on the journals of the houfe, with the
reafons for fuch diffent ; which is ufually ftyled his
proteft.
All bills likewife, that may in their confequences any
way affedl the rights of the peerage, are by the cuftom
of parliament to have their firft rife and beginning in
the houfe of peers, and to fuffer no changes or amend¬
ments in the houfe of commons.
There is alfo one ftatute peculiarly relative to the
houfe of lords; 6 Ann. c. 23. which regulates the
eledlion of the 16 reprefentative pikers of North Britain,
in confequence of the 2 2d and 23d articles of the Union :
and for that purpofe preferibes the oaths, See. to be
taken by the eleftors ; diredls the mode of balloting ;
prohibits the peers electing from being attended in an
unufual manner ; and exprefsly provides, that no other
matter (hall be treated of in that affembly, fave only
the eledlion, on pain of incurring a praemunire. See

Loretto. holy chapel, fo much vifited by pilgrims.
pg]^ according to the legend, was originally a fmall
houfe in Nazareth, inhabited by the virgin Mary, in
which fhe was fainted by the angel, and where lire
bred our Saviour. After their deaths, it was held in
great veneration by all believers in Jefus, and at length
confecrated into a chapel, and dedicated to the Virgin •,
upon which occafion St Luke made that identical
image, which is Hill preferred here, and dignified with
the name of our Lady of Loretto. This fandlified
edifice was allowed to fojourn in Galilee as long as that
didrift was inhabited by Chridians j but when infidels
got pofTeflion of the country, a band of angels, to fave
it from pollution, took it in their arms, and conveyed
it from Nazareth to a .caftle in Dalmatia. This faft
might have been called in quedion by incredulous
people, had it been performed in a fecret manner ;
but, that it might be manifed to the mod fhort-fighted
fpeftator, and evident to all who were not perleftly
■deaf as well as blind, a blaze of celedial light, and a
concert of divine mufic, accompanied it during the
whole journey ; befides, wdien'the angels, to red them-
felves, fet it down in a little wood near the road, all
the trees of the fored bowed their heads to the ground,
and continued in that refpeftful podure as long as the
facred chapel remained among them. But not having
been entertained with fuitable refpeft at the cadle above
mentioned, the dime indefatigable angels carried it over
the fea, and placed it in a field belonging to a noble
lady called Lauretta, from whom the chapel takes its
name. This field happened unfortunately to be fre¬
quented at that time by highwaymen and murderers:
a circumdance with which the angels undoubtedly were
not acquainted when they placed it there. After they
were better informed they removed it to the top of a
hill belonging to twm brothers, where they imagined
it would be perfeftly fecure from the dangers of rob¬
bery or aflaffination ■, but the two brothers, the pro¬
prietors of the ground, being equally enamoured of
their new vifitor, became jealous of each other, quar¬
relled, fought, and fell by mutual wounds. After
this fatal cataftrophe, the angels in waiting finally
moved the holy chapel to the eminence where it now
Hands, and has dood thefe 400 years, having lob all
relidr for travelling.
The facred chapel bands due eab and wed, at the
farther end of a large church of the mod durable done
of Idria, which has been built around it. This may
be conddered as the external covering, or as a kind
of great coat to the cafa Junta, which lias a fmaller
coat of more precious materials and workmandiip
nearer its body. This internal covering or cafe is of
the choiced marble, after a plan of San Savino’s, and
ornamented with baffb relievos, the workmandiip of
the bed fculptors which Italy could furnidi in the reign
of Leo X. The fubjeft of thefe baflb relievos are
the hidory of the Blefled Virgin, and other parts of
the Bible. The whole cafe is about 50 feet long, 30
in breadth, and the fame in height: but the real houfe
it felt is no more than 32 feet in length, 14 in breadth,
and at the fides about 18 feet in height; the centre
of the roof is four or five feet higher. The walls of
this little holy chapel are compofed of pieces of a
reduifh fubdance, of an oblong fquare diape, laid one
upon a' other, in the manner of brick. At fird fight, on
[ 234 ] l o K
This cha- a fuperficial view, thefe red-coloured oblong fubdances
appear to be nothing elfe than common Italian bricks ;
and, which is dill more extraordinary, on a fecond and
third view, with all podible attention, they dill have the
fame appearance. Travellers, however, are allured
with great earnednefs, that there is not a dngle par¬
ticle of brick in their whole compofition, being en¬
tirely of a done, which, though it cannot now be
found in Palebine, was formerly very common, parti¬
cularly in the neighbourhood of Nazareth.
The holy hou!e is divided within into two unequal
portions, by a kind of grate-work of filver. The di-
vifion towards the wed is about three fourths of the
whole ; that to the ead is called the SanBuanj. In
the larger dividon, which may be coniidered as the
main body of the houfe, the walls are left bare, to
fhow the true original fabric of Nazareth done ; for
they mud not be fuppofed to be bricks. At the
lower or wedern wall there is a window, the lame
through which the angel Gabriel entered at the An¬
nunciation. The architraves of this window are co¬
vered with filver. There are a great number of gold¬
en and filver lamps in this chapel ; one of the former,
a prefent from the republic of Venice, is faid to weigh
37 pounds, and fome of the filver lamps weigh from
1 20 to 130 pounds. At the upper end of the larged
room is an altar, but fo low, that from it you may
fee the famous image which Hands over the chimney
in the fmall room or fanftuary. Golden and filver
angels, of confiderable lize, kneel around her, fome
offering hearts of gold, enriched with diamonds, and
one an infant of pure gold. The wall of the fanc-
tuary is plated with filver, and adorned with cruci¬
fixes, precious dones, and votive gifts of various kinds.
The figure of the Virgin herfelf by no means corre-
fponds with the fine furniture of her houfe : She is a
little woman, about four feet in height, with the fea¬
tures and complexion of a negro. Of all the fculp¬
tors that ever exided, affuredly St Luke, by whom
this figure is faid to have been made, is the lead of a
datterer; and nothing can be a ftronger proof of the
Blelfed Virgin’s contempt for external beauty than
her being fatisfied with this reprefentation of her.
The figure of the infant Jefus, by St Luke, is of a piece
with that of the Virgin : he holds a large golden globe
in one hand, and the other is extended in the aft of
bleffing. Both figures have crowns on their heads,
enriched with diamonds : thefe were prefents from
Ann of Audria, queen of France. Both arms of the
Virgin are enclofed within her robes, and no part but
her face is to be feen *, her drefs is mod magnificent,
but in a wretched bad tade : this is not furprifing, for
die has no female attendant. She has particular
clothes for the dilferent feads held in honour of her,
and, which is not quite fo decent, is always dreffed
and undreffed by the prieds belonging to the chapel ;
her robes are ornamented with all kinds of precious

There is a fmall place behind the fanftuary, in

porringer, out of which the infant ufed to eat. The

The gown which the image had on when the chapel

Above 100 maffes are daily faid in this chapel, and
in the church in which it (lands. The jewels and
riches to be feen at any one time in the holy chapel
are of fmall value in comparifon of thofe in the trea-
fury, which is a large room adjoining to the veflry of
the great church. In the preflfes of this room are
kept thofe prefents which royal, noble, and rich bigots
of all ranks, have, by oppreding their fubjefts and
injuring their families, fent to this place. To enume¬
rate every particular would (ill volumes. They confilt

cious (tones, of all kinds and in great numbers. What
is valued above all the other jewels is, the miraculous
pearl, wherein they affert that Nature has given a faith¬
ful delineation of the Virgin fitting on a cloud with
the infant Jefus in her arms. There was not room in
the prefles of the treafury to hold all the filver pieces
which had been prefented to the Virgin. Several other
prefles in the veflry are completely full. It is laid
that thofe pieces are occafionally melted down by his

Pilgrimages to Loretto are not fo frequent with fo¬
reigners, or with Italians of fortune and difhnftion,
as formerly} nineteen out of twenty of thole who
make this journey now are poor people, who depend
for their maintenance on the charity they receive on
the road. To thofe who are in fuch a rank in life as
precludes them from availing themfelves of the cha¬
ritable infHtutions for the maintenance of pilgrims,
fuch journeys are attended with expence and inconve-
rdency ; and fathers and hufbands, in moderate or con¬
fined circumflances, are frequently brought to difagree-
able dilemmas, by the rath vows of going to Loretto
which their wives or daughters are apt to make on any
fuppofed deliverance from danger. To refufe, is con-
fidered by the whole neighbourhood as cruel, and even
impious ; and to grant, is often highly diftrefiing, par¬
ticularly to fuch hufbands as, from affeelion or any
other motives, do not choofe that their wives (hould
be long out of their fight. But the poor, who are
maintained during their whole journey, and have no¬
thing more than a bare maintenance to expefl from
their labour at home, to them a journey to Loretto
is a party of pleafure as well as devotion, and by much
the mod agreeable road they can take to heaven. The
greate't concourfe of pilgrims is at the feafons of Eader

begin a hymn in honour of the Virgin, which they
continue till they reach the church. I he poorer fort
are received into an hofpital, where they have beu and
board for three days.
The only trade of Loretto c enfids of fofaries, cru¬
cifixes, little madonas, agnus dei’s, and medals,
which are manufactured here, and fold to pilgrims.
There are great numbers of (hops full of thefe com¬
modities, feme of them of a high price 5 but infinite¬
ly the greater pait are adapted to the purfes of the
buyers, and fold for a mere trifle. The evident po¬
verty of thofe manufacdurers and traders, and of the
inhabitants of this town in general, is a fufficient proof
that the reputation of our Lady of Loretto is greatly
on the decline.
In the great church which contains the holy chapel
are confeffionals, where the penitents from every coun¬
try of Europe may be confeffed in their own language,
priefls being always in waiting for that purpofe : each
of them has a long white rod in his hand, with which
he touches the heads of thofe to whom he thinks it
proper to give abfolution. They place themfelves on
their knees in groupes around the confeffional chair 5
and when the holy father has touched their heads with
the expiatory rod, they retire, freed from the burden
of their fins, and with renewed courage to begin a
frefh account.
In the fpacious area before this church there is an
elegant marble fountain, fupplied with water from an
adjoining hill by an aqueduft. Few even of the mod
inconliderable towns of Italy are without the ufeful
ornament of a public fountain. The embellilhments
of fculpture and architediure are employed with great
propriety on fuch works, which are continually in the
people’s view j the air is refreflied and the eye delight¬
ed by the dreams of water they pour forth ; a fight
peculiarly agreeable in a warm climate. In this area
there is alfo a datue of Sixtus V. in bronze. Over
the portal of the church itfelf is a datue of the Vir¬
gin ; and above the middle gate is a Latin infeription,
importing that within is the houfe of the mother of
God, in which the Word was made flefh. The gates
of the church are likevvife of bronze, embellifhed with
baflcK relievos of admirable workmanlhip : the fubjefls
taken partly from the Old and partly from the New
Tedament, and divided into different compartments.
As the gates of this church are dmt at noon, the pil¬
grims who arrive after that time can get no nearer the
fanta cafa than thefe gates, which are by this means
fometimes expofed to the fird violence of that holy
ardour which was defigned for the chapel itfelf. All
the fculpture upon the gates which is within reach of
the mouths of thofe zealots, is in fome degree effaced
by their kiffes.
There are alfo feveral paintings to be feen here,
fome of which are highly edeemed, particularly two
in the treafury. The fubjeid of one of thefe is the
Virgin’s Nativity, by Annibal Caracci •, and of the
other, a Holy Family by Raphael. There are fome
others of confiderable merit which ornament the altars
of the great church. Thefe altars, or little chapels,
of which this fabric contains a great number, are lined
with marble and embellifiied by fculpture •, but nothing
within this church intereds a traveller of fenfibility fo
much as the iron grates before thofe chapels, which

LORICA, was a cuirafs, brigantine, or coat of
mall, in ufe among the Roman foldiers. It was gene¬
rally made of leather, and is fuppofed to be derived
from lorum.—The loricae were fet with plates of metal
in various forms ; fometimes in hooks or rings like a
chain, fometin.es like feathers, and fometimes like the
feales of ferpents or fifhes, to which plates of gold
were often added. There were other lighter cuirafies
confiding only of many folds of linen cloth, or of flax
made lliong enough to refill weapons. Such foldiers
as were rated under 1000 drachms, inftead of the lorica
now deferibed, wore a peBorale.—The Roman lorica
was made like a fliirt, and defended the wearer both
before and behind, but was fo contrived that the back
part could be occafionaliy feparated from the front.
Some of the loricae were made of cords of hemp or flax,
clofe fet together ; whence they are called thoraces, bi-
hces, tri/ices, &c. from the number of the cords fixed
one upon another ; but thefe were ufed rather in hunt¬
ing than in the field of battle.

LORNE, a divifion of Argylllhire in Scotland,
which gives the title of marquis to the duke of Argyll.
It extends above 30 miles in length from north to
Ibjuth, and about nine at its utmoft breadth 5 bounded
on the eaft by Braidalbin •, on the welt by the iflands j
on the north, by Lochaber ; and is divided from Knap-
dale on the fouth by Loch Etive, on the banks of
which flands the caftle of Bergomarn, wherein the
courts of juflice wTere anciently held. This diftri£I,
abounding with lakes, is the moft pleafant and fertile
part of Argyllfliire, producing plenty of oats and
barley. It once belonged to the ancient family of
Macdougal, ftill refiding on the fpot *, but devolved to
the lords of Argyll in confequence of a marriage with
the heirefs, at that time a branch of the Stuart family.
The chief place of note in this diftrift is the caftle of
Dunftaffnage, a feat of the Scortilh kings previous to
the conqueft of the Pi61s in 843 by Kenneth II. In
this place was long prelerved the famous Hone, the pal-

Spain, where it was firft ufed as a feat of juilice by Ga- '“""“•v
thelus, coeval with Mofes. It continued here as the
coronation chair till the reign of Kenneth II. who re¬
moved it to Scone, in order to fecure his reign j for,

Some of the ancient regalia were preferved till the pre-
fent century, when the keeper’s fervants, during his
infirm years, embezzled them for the filver ornaments *,
and left only a bhttleaxe, nine feet long, of beautiful
workmanftnp, and ornamented with filver.
The caftle is fquare ; the infide only 87 feet ; partly
ruinous, partly habitable. At three of the corners
are round towers ; one of them proje6ls very little.
The entrance is towards the fea at prefent by a ftair-
cafe, in old times probably by a drawbridge, which
fell from a little gateway. The mafonry appears verv
ancient 5 the tops battlemented. This pile is feated on
a rock at the mouth of Loch Etive, whofe waters'
expand within to a beautiful bay, where ftiips may
fafely ride in all weather. Of this building, the found¬
er of which is unknown, nothing remains except the
outer walls, which, though rooflefs, are ftill in good
order j and within which fome buildings have been
eredled, which ferve as the refidence of the laird.
The duke of Argyll is hereditary keeper under the
crown.— At a fmall diftance from the caftle is a ruined
chapel, once an elegant building •, and at one end an
enclofure, a family cemetery. Oppofite to thefe is a
high precipice, ending abrupt, and turning fuddenly
toward the fouth-eaft. A perfon concealed in the re-
cefs of the rock, a little beyond the angle, furprifes
friends ftationed at fome diftance beneath the precipice
with a very remarkable echo of any word, or even fen-
tence, he pronounces j which reaches the laft diftindl
and unbroken. The repetition is Angle, but remarkably
clear.
In 1307, this caftle was poffefled by Alexander
Macdougal lord of Argyll, a friend to the Englifti :
but was that year reduced by Robert Bruce, when
Macdougal fued for peace with that prince, and was re¬
ceived into favour.
We find, about the year 1455, this to have been a
refidence of the lords of the ifles j for here James laft
earl of Douglas, after his defeat in Annandale, fled to
Donald, the Regulus of the time, and prevailed on him
to take arms and carry on a plundering war againft his
monarch James II.
The fituation of this regal feat was calculated for
pleafure as well as ftrength. The views of mountains,
valleys, waters, and iflands, are delightful. On the

occafions might require. On the bank of the fame

on the north by Luxemburg and the archbilhopric of
Treves, on the eaft by A)face and the duchy of Deux
Fonts, on the fouth by Tranche Comte, and on the
wed. by Champagne and the duchy of Barr. It is about
loo miles in length, and 75 in breadth j and abounds
in all forts of corn, wine, hemp, flax, rape-feed, game
and fifh, with which it carries on fome trade, and in
general all the neceffaries of life. There are fine mea-
doivs and large forefts, with mines of iron, filver, and
copper, as alio fait pits. There are a great number of
rivers ; of which the principal are the Maefe or Meufe,
the Mofelle, the Scille, the Meure, and the Sarre. It
is divided into three parts ; the duchy of Lorrain, pro¬
perly fo called, which was heretofore a fovereign ftate ;
the duchy of Barr, which formerly belonged to the
dukes of Lorrain, but afterwards came under the go¬
vernment of Trance •, and the third comprehends the
three bifhoprics of Metz, Toul, and Verdun, which
have belonged to France ever fince the year 1552. In
1733, the emperor of Germany being at war with
France, this lafl got polleffion of the duchy of Lor¬
rain : and when there was a peace made in 1735, it
was agreed, that Staniflaus king of Poland, father-in-
law to the king of France, fhould poffefs thefe duchies,
and that after his death they fhould be united for ever
to the crown of France. It was alfo then agreed, that
Francis Stephen, duke of Lorrain, and the emperor’s
fon-in-law, fhould have the grand duchy of Tufcany as
an equivalent for Lorrain. After the death of the great
duke of Tufcany, in 1737, King Staniflaus and the
duke of Lorrain took polfellion of their refpeflive do¬
minions, and the ceffion was confirmed and guaran¬
teed by a treaty in 1738. The trade confifts in corn
and linen cloth. Nanci is the capital town.

LOTHIAN, a name given to three counties of
Scotland, viz. Haddingtonlhire, Edinburghfhire, ami
Linlithgowfhire) otherwife called Eqjly Mid, and Wef,
Lothian s..
Lothian.
1. Ealt Lothian, or Haddingtonlhire, is bounded on
the north-weft by the frith of Forth ; and on the' eaft by
the German fea ; on the fouth-eall by Berwicklhire ;
and on the weft by the county of Edinburgh. It ex¬
tends about 25 miles from eaft to weft, and where broad-
eft, nearly 15 from north to fouth. The coaft, advan¬
cing northward into the frith, forms an irregular curve.
—This is one of the molt fruitful counties in Scotland,
producing great quantities of wheat and all forts of
grain, well watered, and plentifully fupplied with fiih,
fowl, fuel, and all the neceffaries of life. It abounds
with towns, villages, and farms, interfperfed with a
great number of agreeable houfes belonging to perfons
of rank and fortune. For cultivation, populoufnefs, and
fertility, this {hire may vie with any tract of land in the
iiland of Great Britain. Befide fanning, which is fuc-
cefsfully carried on, the people towards the fea-coaft
employ themfelves in the fifnery, falt-making, and in
foreign trade ; and fome of the more inland inhabitants
engage in the linen and woollen manufactures. Lime-
ftone and coal are found in molt parts of the county,
and great numbers of Iheep are fed on the hills of Larri-
mermuir.
2. Edinburghfhire, or Mid Lothian, is about 35
miles long, but varies in its breadth in different places
from five to 16 miles. It is bounded on the eaft by
Haddingtonfhire ; on the weft by the fliire of Linlith¬
gow *, on the fouth, by Tweeddale or Peeblesfliire •,
and on the north, by part of Weft Lothian and the
frith of Forth. The afpect of the country is in general
level and pleafant, interfperfed with a few hills, that
help to exhibit agreealsle profpe&s. It is well watered
with rivers, and fhaded with woods. It produces plenty
of coal, limeftone, a foft black marble, and fome cop¬
per ore. The foil, of itlelf fertile, is finely cultivated,
and yields as plentiful harvefts of excellent wheat as are
found in any part of Great Britain. The whole fhire is
interfperfed with noble houfes and plantations belonging
to noblemen and gentlemen of fortune. The farmers,
in general, are Ikilful and wealthy. The country is
well inhabited, and prefents us with a good number of
towns and populous villages. Along the fea coaft the
common people fubfift by fittiing, and traffic in coals
and fait, and fome few carry on a fmuggling com¬
merce. Thofe in the inland are employed in farming,
and fome branches of the weaving manufacture. Edin¬
burgh is a county within itfelf.
3. The (hire of Linlithgow, or Weft Lothian, is
bounded on the north by the frith of Forth. The final!
river Almond divides it from Edinburghlltire on the
eaft. On the fouth-weft it joins the county of Lanark 5
and on the weft, it is parted from Stirlinglhire by Avon,
a finall river. Its form, though irregular, approaches
to a parallelogram. It meafures from north-eaft to
fouth-weft, nearly 20 miles. Its breadth, except on.
the fhore of the frith, does not exceed 12.—-The coun-

LOTOPHAGI, in Ancient Geography, a people of
the Regio Syrtica (fo called from their living on the
lotus) ; inhabiting between the two Syrtes from the Ci-
nyphus to the Triton. The lotus was faid to be a food
fo lufcious, as to make Itrangers forget their native
country.- A fweet wine was expreffcd from it, which
did not keep above ten days, (Pliny).

LOTTERY, a kind of public game at hazard, fre¬
quent in Britain, France, and Holland, in order to raife
money for the fervice of the ftate ; being appointed with
us by the authority of parliament, and managed by
commiffioners appointed by the lords of the treafury for
that purpofe. It confifts of feveral numbers of blanks
and prizes, which are drawn out of wheels, one of
which contains the numbers, and the other the corre-
fponding blanks or prizes.
The Romans invented lotteries to enliven their Sa¬
turnalia. This feftival began by the ditfribution of
tickets which gained fome prize. Auguftus made
lotteries which confilled of things of little value;
but Nero eftablilhed fome for the people, in which
1000 tickets were diilributed daily, and feveral of
thofe who were favoured by Fortune got rich by them.
Heliogabalas invented fome very fingular : the prizes
were either of great value or of none at all ; one gain¬
ed a prize of fix flaves, and another of fix flies 5 fome
got valuable vales, and others vafes of common earth.
A lottery of this kind exhibited an excellent picture of
the inequality with which Fortune difiributes her fa¬
vours.
The firfl: Englifli lottery we find mentioned in hiftory
was drawn A. D. 1569. It confided of 40,000 lots,
at r os. each lot: the prizes were plate ; and the profits
were to go towards repairing the havens of this king¬
dom. It was drawn at the weft door of St Paul’s ca¬
thedral. The drawing began on the nth of January
1569, and continued inceffantly, day and night, till the
6th of May following j as Maitland, from Stowe, in¬
forms us in his hiftory, vol. i. p. 2^7. There were
then only three lottery offices in London. The propo-
fals for 'his lottery were publifhed in the years 1567
and 1568. It was at firft intended to have been drawn
at the houfe of Mr Dericke, her majefty’s fervant, i. e.
her jeweller, but was afterwards drawn as above men¬
tioned.

In the reign of Queen Anne, it was thought necef-
fary to fupprefs lotteries, as nuifances to the public.
Since that time, however, they have been licenfed by
an aft of parliament, under various regulations. The
aft palled in 1778 reftrains any perfon from keeping an
office for the fale of tickets, (hares, or chances, or for
buying, felling, enfuring, or regiftering, without a li-
cenfe ; for which licenfe each office-keeper muft pay
50I. to continue in force for one year, and the produce
to be applied towards defraying the expences of the lot¬
tery. And no perfon is allowed to fell any (hare or
chance lefs than a fixteenth, on the penalty of 50I.
All tickets divided into (hares or chances are to be de-
pofited in an office, to be eftablifhed in London by the
commiffioners of the treafury, who are to appoint a
perfon to conduft the bufinefs thereof; and all (hares
are to be damped by the faid officer, who is to give a
receipt for every ticket depofited with him. The num¬
bers of all tickets fo depofited are to be entered in a
book, with tiie names of the owners, and the number’
of (hares into which they are divided ; and twopence
for each (hare is to be paid to the officer on depofiting
fuch tickets, who is therewith to pay all expences inci¬
dent to the office. All tickets depofited in the office
are to remain there three days after the drawing. And
any perfon keeping an office, or felling (hares, or who
(hall publifti any fcheme for receiving moneys in confi-

LOVAGR. See Ligusticum, J
LOVE, in a large fenfe of the word, denotes all
thofe affefb'ons of the pleafing kind which objefts and
incidents raiie in us ; thus we are faid to love not only
intelligent agents of morally good difpofitions, but alfo
fenfual pleafures, riches, and honours. But
Love, in its ufual and more appropriate lignification,
may be defined, “ that affedfion which, being com¬
pounded of animal defire, cfteem, and benevolence, be¬
comes the bond of attachment and union between indi¬
viduals of the different fexes ; and makes them feel in
the fociety of each other a fpecies of happinefs which
they experience no where elfe.” We call it an afcc-
twn rather than a pajjion, becaufe it involves a defire of
the happinefs of its objedt : And that its conflituent
parts are thofe wdiich have been juft enumerated, we
fhall firft endeavour to prove, and then proceed to trace
its rife and progrcfs from a felfifh appetite to a generous
fentiment.
Animal defire is the adhial energy of the fenfual ap-
pietite : and that it is an eflential part of the complex
aftedh’on, which is properly called love, is apparent
from this confideration, that though a man may have
fentiments of efteem and benevolence towards women
who are both old and ugly, he never fuppofes himfelf
to be in love of any woman, to whom he feels not the
fenfual appetite to have a ftronger tendency than to
other individuals of her fex. On the other hand, that
animal defire alone cannot be called the aftedlion of love
is evident ; becaufe he who gratifies fuch a defire with¬
out efteeming its objedf, and wifhing to communicate
at the fame time that he receives enjoyment, loves not
the woman, but himfelf. Mere animal defire has nothing
in view but the fpecies and the fex of its object; and
before it make a feledtion, it muft be combined wdth
fentiments very different from itfelf. The firft fenti¬
ment with which it is combined, and by wdrich a man
is induced to prefer one woman to another, feems to
be that by vrhich we are delighted with gracefulnefs
of perfon, regularity of features, and beauty of com¬
plexion. It is not indeed to be denied that there is
Something irrefiftible in female beauty. The moft fe-
vere will not pretend that they do not feel an imme¬
diate prepofteftion in favour of a handfome wmman :
but this prepofleffion, even when combined with ani¬
mal. defire, does not conftitute the wdrole of that af-
feflion which is called love. Savages feel the influ¬
ence of the fenfual appetite, and it is extremely pro¬
bable that they have fome ideas of beauty ; but among
lavages the affeClion of love is feldom felt. Even among
the lower orders in civil fociety it feems to be a very
grofs paffion, and to have in it more of the felfifhnefs
of appetite than of the generofity of efteem. To
thefe obfervations many exceptions will no doubt be love,
found (a) : but we fpeak of favages in general, and 0f
the great body of the labouring poor, who in the choice
of their mates do not ftudy—who indeed are incapable
°f ftudying, that reefitude of mind, and thofe delicacies
of fentiment, without which neither man nor woman
can deferve to be efteemed.
^In the favage ftate, and even in the firft ftages of
lennement, the bond of union betw7een the fexes Ifecnrs
to confitf of nothing more than mere animal defire
and inftindHve tendernefs for their infant progeny.
I he former impels them to unite for the propagation
of the fpecies 5 and the latter preferves the union, till
the childien, who aie the fruit of it, be able to provide
for their owm fubfiftence. That in fuch unions, whe¬
ther cafual or permanent, there is no mutual efieem and
benevolence, is apparent from the ftate of fubje&ion in
which wmmen are held in rude and uncultivated na¬
tions, as well as from the manner in which marriages
are in fuch nations contra£ted.
Sweetnefs of temper, a capital article with us in the
female charafter, difplays itfelf externally in mild looks
and gentle manners, and is the firft and perhaps the
moft powerful inducement to love in a cultivated
mind. “ But fuch graces ((ays an ingenious writer *) * Sketches
are fcarce difcernible in a female favage; and exewofthe Hif~
in the moft polifhed woman w?ould not be perceived tory °f
by a male lavage. Among favages, ftrength and boU-Man'
nefs are the only valuable qualities. In thefe, females
are miferably deficient ; for which reafon they are con¬
temned by the males as beings of an inferior order..
The North American tribes glory in idlenefs: the
drudgery of labour degrades a man in their opinion,
and is proper for women only. To join young perfons
in marriage is accordingly the bufinefs of the parents;
and it would be unpardonable meannefs in the bride¬
groom to fhow any fond nefs for the bride. In Guiana
a woman never eats with her hufband, but after every
meal attends him with water for vvalhing ; and in the
Caribbee ifiands (he is not even permitted to eat in the
prefence of her hufband. Dampier obferves in general,
that among all the wild nations with which he w:as ac¬
quainted, the women carry the burdens, while the men
walk before and carry nothing but their arms ; and
that women even of the higheft rank are not better
treated. In Siberia, and even in Ruftia, the capital
excepted, men till very lately treated their wives in
every refpedf like Haves. It might indeed be thought,
that animal defire, were there nothing elfe, ftiould have*
railed w'omen to fome degree of eftimation amonp- men ;
but male favages, utter ftrangers to decency and°refine-
ment, gratify animal defire with as little ceremony as
they do hunger or thirft.
“ lienee it was that in the early ages of fociety a
man pur chafed a woman to be his wife, as one purchafes
an ox or a (Keep to be food ; and valued her only as
[he contributed to his fenfual gratification. Inftances
innumerable might be colle&ed- from every nation of
which we are acquainted with the early hiftory ; but

Love, we (hall content ourfelves with mentioning a few. A-
^ braham bought Rebekah and gave her to his fon Ifaac
* Gen. xxiv. for a wife *. Jacob having nothing elfe to give, ferved
f Gen. xxix. Laban 14 years for two wives f. To David, demand¬
ing Saul’s daughter in marriage, it was faid, ‘ The
king defireth not any dowry, but an hundred forelkins
f 1 Sam. of the Philiftines J;.’ In the Iliad Agamemnon offers
xvni. 28. his daughter to Achilles for a wife ; and fays that he
§ Lib. ix. would not demand for her any price By the laws
of Ethelbert king of England, a man who committed
adultery with his neighbour’s wife was obliged to pay
j| Se<fb 32. the hufhand a fine, and to buy him another But
it is needlefs to multiply inftances 5 the pradiice has
prevailed univerfally among nations emerging from the
favage ftate, or in the rudeft ftage of fociety : and
wherever it prevailed, men could not pofiibly have for
the fair fex any of that tender regard and efieem which
eonftitute fo elfential a part of the complex affe&ion
of love.
Accordingly we find the magnanimous Achilles an
abfolute ftranger to that generous affeftion, though his
heart was fufceptible of the v-armeft and pureft friend-
fhip. His attachment to Patrcclus was fo heroically
difinterefled, that he willingly facrificed his own life to
revenge the death of his friend ; but w’hen Agamemnon
threatened to rob him of his favourite female captive,
though he felt the infult offered to his pride, he never
fpoke of the woman but as a flave whom he was con¬
cerned to preferve in point of honour, and as a teilimo-
ny of his glory. Hence it is that wo never hear him
mention her but as his fpoil, the reward of war, or the
gift which the Grecians gave him.
“ And dar’ft thou threat to fnatch my prize away,
“ Due to the deeds of many a dreadful day ?
“ A prize as ftnall, O tyrant ! match’d with thine,
“ As thy own aftions if compar’d with mine.
“ Thine in each conqueft is the wealthy prey,
“ Tho’ mine the fweat and danger of the day.
“ Some trivialprefent to my {hips I bear,
“ Or barren praifes pay the wrounds of war.”
And again, after upbraiding the general with his ty¬
ranny and want of regard to merit, he adds, with the
greateft indifference as to the charms of the woman,
“ Seize on Brifei's, whom the Grecians doom’d
“ My prize of war, yet tamely fee refuni’d;
“ And feize fecure ; no more Achilles draws
“ His conquering fword in any woman’s caufe.
1 L O V
The gods command me to forgive the pafi: j Love.
But let this firft invajion be the laft : ' “!r V"
For know, thy blood, when next thou dar’ft invade.
Shall ftream in vengeance on my reeking blade.”
Pope has made the language of thiff rough wrarrior lefs
inconfiftent with the peculiar refentment natural to an
injured lover than it is in the original (b) j but from
the laft quoted paffage, even as tranflated by him, it is
apparent that Achilles would have been equally hurt
had Agamemnon threatened to deprive him of any
other part of his plunder. Accordingly he yields up
Brifeis, not in grief for a mittrefs whom he lofes, but in
fullennefs for an injury that is done him. Nor let it be
imagined, that this coldnefs proceeded from the pride
of the hero, which would not permit him to acknowr-
ledge his love of a captive. With the generous affec¬
tion of love captives and princeffes were equally inca¬
pable of infpi.ing him. He repeatedly affirmed indeed
that he delighted in his fair Lyrneffian Have, but it was
only as an inftrument of fenfual gratification ; for as to
every thing elfe in a woman, he was fo totally indiffer¬
ent, that he declared he would not, when he ffiould be
difpofed to marry, give hirofelf the trouble to make a
choice, but leave the whole matter to his father.
“ If heav’n reftorc me to my realms with life,
“ The rev’rend Peleus (hall elect my wife.”
Even Agamemnon, of whom Pope and Madame Da-
cier think more favourably as a lover, fpeaks the very
fame language when mentioning his favourite captive
Chryfeis. In his furious debate with Achilles he calls
her indeed—
“ A maid, unmatch’d in manners as in face,
“ Skill’d in each art, and crown’d with ev’ry grace.”
And adds,
“ Not half fo dear were Clytemneftra’s charms,
“ When firft her blooming beauties bleft my arms.”
But this was faid merely to enhance the value of the
prize, which for the public good he w^as about to re-
fign •, for that (lie was dear to him only as miniftering to
his pleafure, is paft difpute from the language which he
had previoufiy held with her father, as well as from his
requiring grateful Greece to pay a juft equivalent, and
to repair his private lofs. A man who really lovea
wmuld have thought nothing an equivalent for the object
of his love ; much lefs would he have inlinuated to her
father

In this latter paffage the hero fays exprefsly, “ I will

woman whom he eiteemed, when time Ihould have rob¬
bed her of every youthful grace.
Since, then, it is fo apparent, that in the heroic age
of Greece even princes and kings were ftrangers to
the generous afteftion of love, it needs not occafion
much furprife that the fame affe&ion has very little
influence upon mankind in the lowed ranks of the mod
polidied focieties of modern Europe. That this is
a&ually the cafe, that among the generality of une¬
ducated men and women there is no other bond of at¬
tachment than the fenfual appetite, every year furniihes
multiplied proofs. We daily fee youths, rejesded by
their midrefles, paying their addrefles without delay
to girls who, in looks, temper, and difpofition, are
diametrically oppofite to thofe whom fo lately they
pretended to love : We daily fee maidens, flighted by
their lovers, receiving the addreffes of men,' who, in
nothing but their fex, referable thofe to whom a week
before they wilhed to be married : and we believe it
is not very uncommon to find a girl entertaining feveral
lovers together, that if one or more of them fliould prove
falfe, die may dill have a chance not to be totally de-
ferted. Did efleem and benevolence, placed on man¬
ners and character, conflitute any part of vulgar love,
thefe people would aft very differently $ for they would
find it impoflible to change their lovers and their mi-
ftrefles with the fame eafe that they change their
elothes.
To this account of love, as it appears in favage
nations, fome one may perhaps oppofe the paintings
of the fofter paflion in the poems of Oflian. That
bard deferibes the female charafter as commanding re-
fpeft and efl:eern,^ and the Caledonian heroes as cheridi-
ing for their midrefles a flame fo pure and elevated as
never was furpaffed, and has feldom been equalled,
in thofe ages which we commonly call mod enlightened.
This is indeed true : and it is one of the many reafons
which have induced Johnlbn and others to pronounce
the whole a modern fiftion. Into that debate we do not
enter. We may admit the authenticity of the poems,
without acknowledging that they furnifh any exception
to our general theory. They furnilh indeed in the man¬
ners which they deferibe a wonderful anomaly in the
general hidory of man. All other nations of which we
read were in the hunter date favage and cruel. The
Caledonians, as exhibited by Oflian, are gentle and mag¬
nanimous. T he heroes of Homer fought for plunder,
and felt no clemency for a vanquilhed foe. The heroes
of Oflian fought for fame 5 and when their enemies
were fubdued, they took them to their bofoms. The
firfl of Greeks committed a mean infult on the dead
body of the firfl of Trojans. Among the Caledonians
infults offered to the dead, as well as cruelty to the
^.v*ng> were condemned as infamous. The heroes of
Oflian appear in no inflance as favages. How they
came to be. polifhed and refined before they were ac¬
quainted with agriculture and the mod ufeful arts of
life, it is not our bufinefs to inquire y but fince they
unqueflionably were fo, their treatment of the female
lex, inflead of oppofing, confirms our theory j for we
never conceived rich clothes, fuperb houfes, highly-
drefled food, or even the knowledge of foreign tongues
to be neceflary to the acquifition of a generous fenti-
ment. Luxury indeed appears to be as inimical to love

as barbariim : and we believe, that in modern nations, Love,
the tender and exalted affeftion vvhich deferves that —“”"V“
name is as little known among the highefl orders of life
as among the lowed. Perhaps the Caledonian ladies
°f Oflian refembled in their manners the German ladies
of Tacitus, who accompanied their hufbands to the
chafe,, fought by their fides in battle, and partook
with them of every danger. If fo, they could not fail
to be refpefted by a race of heroes among whom cou¬
rage took place of all other virtues: and this Angle
circumdance, from whatever caufe it might proceed
will fufficiently account for the eflimation of the female
charafter among the ancient Germans and Caledoni¬
ans, fo different from that in which it has been held in
almofl every other barbarous nation.
But if. among favages and the vulgar, love be un¬
known, it cannot poffibly be an inflinftive affeftion :
and therefore it may be alked, How it gets poffeflion
of the human heart; and by what means we can judge-
whether in any particular inflance it be real or imagi¬
nary ? Ihefe queflions are of importance, and deferve

fpire to render it no eafy talk to give to them fuch an-

fift only between individuals of the different fexes,
A man can hardly love two women at the fame time j
and we believe that a woman is Hill lefs capable of lov*
ing at once more than one man. Love, therefore, has
a natural tendency to make men and women pair, or,
in other wrards, it is the fource of marriage : but in
polifhed fociety, wfliere alone this affeftion has any
place, fo many things befides mutual attachment are
neceffary to make the married life comfortable, that
we rarely fee young perfons uniting from the impulfe
of love, and have therefore but few opportunities of
tracing the rife, progrefs, and confequences of the af-
feftion. We (hall, however, throw together fuch re¬
flections as have occurred to us on the fubjeft, not
without indulging a hope, that they may be ufeful to
the younger part of our readers when forming the
mod important connexion in life.
We have faid, that the perception of beauty, com¬
bined with animal defire, is the firfi inducement which
a man can have to prefer one woman to another. It
may be added, that elegance of figure, a placid maf-
culine countenance, with a perfon which indicates
ftrength and agility, are the qualities which firfl tend
to attach any woman to a particular man. Beauty
has been defined*, “That particular form, which is * % Vert
the mod common of all particular forms to be met [Buffier in
with in the fame fpecies of beings.” Let us apply am)
this, definition to our own fpecies, and try, by means Sir Jothua
of it, to afeertain what conftitutes the beauty of the Reynolds
human face. It is evident, that of countenances we'n the
find a number almofl infinite of different forms, oiIdler'
which forms one only conflitutes beauty, whilfl^he
red, however numerous, conflitute what is not beauty,
but deformity or uglinefs. To an attentive obferver’
however, it is evident, that of the numerous particular
forms of uglinefs, there is not one which includes fo
many faces as are formed after that particular cad
which, conditutes beauty. Every particular fpecies of
the animal as wrell as of the vegetable creation, may be
faid to have a fixed or determinate form, to w hich, as
to a centre, nature is continually inclining. Or it may

be compared to pendulums vibrating in different di¬
rections over one central point •, and as they all crofs
the centre, though only one paffes through any other
point ; fo it will be found that perfeB beauty is oftener
produced by nature than deformity : we do not mean
than deformity in general, but than any one bind and
degree of deformity. To inftance in a particular part
of a human feature : the line which forms the ridge of
the nofe is deemed beautiful wrhen it is Jlraight; but this
is likewife the central form, which is oftener found
than any one particular degree of concave, convex, or
any other irregular form that fhall be propofed. As we
are then more accuftomed to beauty than deformity,
we may conclude that to be the reafon why we approve
and admire it, juft as we approve and admire fafhions
of drefs for no other reafon than that we are ufed to
them. The fame thing may be faid of colour as of
form : it is cuftom alone which determines our prefer¬
ence of the colour of the Europeans to that of the Ethio¬
pians, and which makes them prefer their own colour
to ours; fo that though habit and cuftom cannot be the
eaufe of beauty (fee Beauty), they are certainly the
caufe of our liking it.
That we do Wee it cannot be denied. Every one is
•eonfcious of a pleafmg emotion when contemplating
beauty either in man or woman ; and when that plea-
fure is combined with the gratification of the fenfual
appetite, it is obvious that the fum of enjoyment muft
be greatly inCreafed. The perception of beauty,
therefore, neceffarily direfts the energy of the fenfual
appetite to a particular objeft ; but ftill this combina¬
tion is a mere felfifli feeling, which regards its objedl
only as the bejl of many Jimilar inftruments of pleafure.
Before it can deferve the name of love, it muft be com¬
bined with efteem, which is never beftowed but upon
moral chara&er and internal worth ; for let a rvoman
be ever fo beautiful, and of courfe ever fo defirable as
an inftrument of fenfual gratification, if ftie be not
poffeffed of the virtues and difpofitions which are pe¬
culiar to her fex, (he will infpire no man with a gene¬
rous affe&ion. With regard to the outlines, indeed,
whether of internal difpofition or of external form,
men and women are the fame ; but nature, intending
them for mates, has given them difpofitions, which
though concordant, are, however, different, fo as to
produce together delicious harmony. “ The man,
more robuft, is fitted for fevere labour, and for field
exercifes; the woman, more delicate, is fitted for fe-
dentary occupations, and particularly for nurfing chil¬
dren. The man, bold and vigorous, is qualified for
being a prote&or * ; the woman, delicate and timid,
requires proteftion. Hence it is, that a man never
admires a woman for poffefling bodily ftrength or per-
fonal courage ; and women always defpife men who are
totally deftitute of thefe qualities. The man, as a protec¬
tor, is direfted by nature to govern; the woman, confci-
ous of inferiority, is difpofed to obey. Their intelleftual
powers correfpond to the deftination of nature. Men
have penetration and folid judgement to fit them for
governing; w’omen have fufficient underftanding to
make a decent figure under good government: a great¬
er proportion would excite dangerous rivalftiip between
the fexes, which nature has avoided by giving them
different talents. Women have more imagination and
fenfibility ^han men, which n^ahe all their enjoyment*
more exquifite; at the fame time that they are better
qualified to communicate enjoyment. Add another
capital difference of difpofition : the gentle and infi-
nuating manners of the female fex tend to foften the
roughnefs of the other fex ; and wdierever women are
indulged with any freedom, they poliih fooner than
Love.
men.
“ Thefe are not the only particulars that diftinguilh
the fexes. With refpedl to the ultimate end of love,,
it is the privilege of the male, as fuperior and protec¬
tor, to make a choice : the female, preferred, has no
privilege but barely to confent or to refufe. Whether
this diftinftion be the immediate refult of the original¬
ly different difpofitions of the fexes, or only the effett
of affociations inevitably formed, may be queftioned ;
but among all nations it is the pradfice for men to
court, and for women to be courted : and were the
moft beautiful woman on earth to invert this practice,
ftie would forfeit the efteem, however by her external
grace ftie might excite the defire, of the man whom
ftie addreffed. The great moral virtues which may
be comprehended under the general term integrity, are
all abfolutely neceffary to make either men or women
eftimable; but to procure efteem to the female charac¬
ter, the modefty peculiar to their fex is a very effential
circumftance. Nature hath provided them with it as
a defence againft the artful felicitations of the other
fex before marriage, and alfo as a fupport of conjugal
fidelity.
A woman, therefore, whofe difpofitions are gentle,
delicate, and rather timid than bold, who is pofleffed
of a large (hare of fenfibility and modefty, and whofe
manners are foft and infinuating, muft, upon moral
principles (fee Moral Philosophy), command the
efteem and benevolence of every individual of the other
fex who is poffefl'ed of found underftanding; but if
her perfon be deformed, or not luch as to excite fome
degree of animal defire, ftie will attradl no man’s love*
In like manner, a man whofe moral charadter is good,
whofe underftanding is acute, and whofe converfation
is inflrudlive, muft command the efteem of every fen-
fible and virtuous woman ; but if his figure be dif-
agreeable, his manner unpoliftied, his habits flovenly,
and above all, if he be deficient in perfonal courage,
he will hardly excite defire in the female bread. It is
only rvhen the qualities which command efteem are,
in the fame perfon, united •with thofe which excite de¬
fire, that the individual fo accompliftied can be an ob-
jeft of love to one of the other fex ; but when thefe
qualities are thus united, each of them increafes the
other in the imagination of the lover. The beauty of
his miftrefs gives her, in his apprehenfion, a greater
fnare of gentlenefs, modefty, and every thing which
adorns the female charadler, than perhaps ftie really pof-
feffes; whilft his perfuafion of her internal worth makes
him, on the other hand, apprehend her beauty to be ab¬
folutely unrivalled.
To this theory an objedlion readily offers itfelf,
which it is incumbent upon us to obviate. Men and
women fometimes fall in love at firft fight, and very
often before they have opportunities of forming a juft
eftimate of each other’s moral character : How is thi*
circumftance to be reconciled with the progreflive ge¬

mv. Every paflion and habitual difpofition of mind
gives a particular caft to the countenance, and is apt
to difcover itfelf in fome feature of the face. This we
learn by experience •, and in time, without any effort
of our own, the idea of each particular caft of counte¬
nance comes to be fo clofely affociated in our minds
with the internal difpofition which it indicates, that
the one can never afterwards be prefented to our view
without inftantly fuggefting the other to the imagi¬
nation. (See Metaphysics and Physiognomy).
Hence it is that every man, who has been accuftomed
to make obfervations, naturally forms to himfelf, from
the features and lineaments of a ftranger’s face, fome
opinion of his chara&er and fortune. We are no
fooner prefented to a perfon for the firft time, than we
are immediately impreffed with the idea of a proud, a
referved, an affable, or a good-natured man •, and upon
our going into a company of abfolute ftrangers, our
benevolence or averfion, our awe or contempt, rifes
inftantly towards particular perfons, betore we have
heard them fpeak a word, or know fo much as their
names or defignationS. The fame thing happens
when we are prefented to the fair fex. If a woman,
feen for the firft time, have that particular caft of
countenance, and that expreffion of features, to which
we have affociated notions of gentlenefs, modejly, and
other female virtues, (he inftantly commands oxxxejleem;
and if ftre have likewife fo much beauty as to make her
an objefl of particular defire, efteem and defire become
fuddenly combined $ and that combination conftitutes
the affe&ion of love. Such, too, is the nature of all
mental affociations, that each part of which they are
compofed adds ftrength and vividnefs to the other parts;
lo that, in the prefent inftance, defire makes us imagine
virtues in the woman which her countenance perhaps
does not indicate ; and the virtues w’hich are there ac¬
tually vifible, make us apprehend her beauty as more
perfedl than it is.
The affedftion thus generated is more or lefs pure,
and will be more or lefs permanent, according as the
one or the other part of which it is compounded pre¬
dominates. “ Where defire of poffeflion * prevails over
our efteem of the perfon and merits of the defirable
objett, love lofes its benevolent chara&er : the appe¬
tite for gratification becomes ungovernable, and tends
violently to its end, regardlefs of the mifery that muft
follow. In that ftate love is no longer a fweet agree¬
able affe&ion; it becomes a felfiih, painful paflion,
which, like hunger and thirft, produceth no happi-
nefs but in the inftant of fruition ; and when fruition
is over, difguft and averfion generally fucceed to defire.
On the other hand, where efteem, founded on a virtu¬
ous charafter and gentle manners, prevails over animal
defire, the lover would not for the world gratify his
appetite at the expence of his miftrefs’s honour or
peace of mind. He wifhes, indeed, for enjoyment;
and to him enjoyment is more exquifite than to the mere
fenfual lover, becaufe it unites fentiment with the gra¬
tification of fenfe ; at the fame time that, fo far from
being fucceeded by difguft or averfion, it increafes his
benevolence to the woman, whofe chara&er and man¬
ners he efteems, and who has contributed fo much to
his pleafure. Benevolence to an individual, having a
general end, admits of a£ts without number, and is fel-
dom fully accomplifhed. Hence mutual love, which is
2+3 1 L O V
compofed chiefly of efteem and benevolence, can hard-
ly be of a fhorter duration than its objects. Frequent
enjoyment endears fuch lovers to each other, and makes
conllancy a plealure ; and when the days ol fenfual en¬
joyment are over, efteem and benevolence will remain
in the mind, making fweet, even in old age, the focie-
ty of that pair, in whom are colledled the affections of
hulband, wife, lover, friend, the tendereft affections ot
human nature.”
From the whole of this inveftigation, we think it
appears, that the affeftion between the fexes which
deferves the name of love, is inseparably connected
with virtue and delicacy ; that a man ot loole morals
cannot be a faithful or a generous lover ; that in the
breaft of him who has ranged from woman to woman
for the mere gratification of his fenfual appetite, de¬
fire muft have effaced all efteem for the female charac¬
ter ; and that, therefore, the maxim too generally re-,
ceived, “ that a reformed rake makes the belt huf-
band,” has very feldom a chance to be true. We
think it may likewife be inferred, that thoufands fan¬
cy themfelves in love who know not what love is, or
how it is generated in the human breaft : and there-

fore we beg leave to advife fuch of our readers as may
imagine themfelves to be in that ftate, to examine their
own minds, with a view to difcover, whether, if the ob-
je£ls of their love were old or ugly, they would ftill
efteem them for the virtues of their chara&er, and the
propriety of their manners. This is a queftion which
deferves to be wrell w'eighed by the young and the
amorous, who, in forming the matrimonial connexion,
are too often blindly impelled by the mere animal defire
inflamed by beauty. “ It may indeed happen f, after
the pleafure of gratifying that defire is gone (and if
not refined by efteem and benevolence, go it muft with
a fwift pace), that a new bond of attachment may be
formed upon more dignified and more lafting princi¬
ples ; but this is a dangerous experiment. Even fup-
pofing good fenfe, good temper, and internal worth of
every fort, yet a new attachment upon fuch qualifica¬
tions Is rarely formed ; becaufe it corntnonly or rather
always, happens, that fuch qualifications, the only folid
foundation of an indiffoluble connexion, if they did not
originally make efteem predominate over animal defire,
are afterwards rendered altogether invifible by fatiety
of enjoyment creating difguft.”
Love, in Medicine. The fymptoms produced by
this paflion as a difeafe, according to medical writers,
are as follow : The eyelids often twinkle ; the eyes
are hollow, and yet appear as if full with pleafure:
the pulfe is not peculiar to the paflion, but the fame
with that which attends folicitude and care. When
the objeft of this affe&ion is thought of, particularly
if the idea is fudden, the fpirits are confufed, the pulfe
changes, and its force and time are very variable: in
fome inftances, the perfon is fad and watchful; in
others, the perfon, not being confcious of his ftate,
pines away, is flothful, and regardlefs of food; though
the wifer, when they find themfelves in love, feek
pleafant company and a&ive entertainments. As the
force of love prevails, fighs grow deeper ; a tremor af-
fe<fts the heart and pulfe; the countenance is alternate¬
ly pale and red ; the voice is fuppreffed in the fauces ;
the eyes grow dim ; cold fweats break out; fleep ab-
fents itfelf, at leaft until the morning.; the fecretions

ftitutes the fad cataftrophe. On this fubjeft the curi¬
ous may confult iEgineta, lib. iii. cap. 17. Oribat. Sy-
nop. lib. viii. cap. 9. or a treatife profeffedly written on
love, as it is a diftemper, by James Ferrard, Oxford,
printed 1640.
The manners of the Greeks and Romans were fimi-
lar to each other in the affairs of love. They general¬
ly made a difcovery of their pafiion by writing upon
trees, walls, doors, &c. the name- of their beloved.
They ufually decked the door of their dulcinea with
flowers and garlands, made libations of wine before their
houfes, fprinkling the pofts with the fame liquor, as if
the objeft of their affe&ion vras a real goddefs. For a
man’s garland to be untied, and for a woman to com-
pofe a garland, were held to be indubitable indications
of their love.
When their love was without fuccefs, they ufed fe-
veral arts to excite affe&ion in the objeft of their de¬
fire. They had recourfe to enchantreffes, of whom the
Theffalian were in the higheft eftimation. The means
made ufe of were mofl comrjionly philtres or love po¬
tions, the operation of which was violent and danger¬
ous, and frequently deprived fuch as drank them of their
reafon. Some of the moft remarkable ingredients of
which they were compofed were : the hippomanes, the
jynx, infefts bred from putrefadlion, the fifh remora,
the lizard, brains of a calf, the hairs on the tip of a
wolf’s tail, his fecret parts, the bones of the left fide of
a toad eaten with ants, the blood of doves, bones of
fnakes, feathers of fcreech-owls, twifted cords of wool
in -which a perfon had hanged himfelf, rags, torches,
reliques, a neft of fwallows buried and familhed in the
earth, bones fnatched from hungry bitches, the marrow
of a boy familhed in the midfl: of plenty, dried human
liver ; to thefe may be added feveral herbs growing
out of putrid fubftances. Such were the ingredients that
entered into the compofition of that infernal draught a
/ove potion.
But, befides the philtres, various other arts were
ufed to excite love, in w hich the application of certain
fubftances was to have a magical influence on the per-
fcn againft whom they levelled their Ikill. A hyaena’s
udder worn under the left arm, they fancied would
draw the affeSions of whatever woman they fixed
their eyes upon. That fpecies qf olives called ■xflvgx,
and barley-bran made up into a pafle, and thrown into
the fire, they thought would excite the flame of love.
Flour was ufed with the fame intention. Burning lau¬
rel, and melted wax, were fuppofed to have the like
effe£l. When one heart was to be hardened, and ano¬
ther mollified, clay and wax were expofed to the fame
fire together. Images of wax were frequently ufed, re-
prefenting the perfons on whom they wiflied to make
an impreflion } and whatever was done to the fubftitute
of wax, they imagined was felt by the perfon repre-
fented. Enchanted medicaments were often fprinkled
on (ome part of the houfe where the perfon refided.
Love pledges were fuppofed to be of fingular ufe and
efficacy : thefe they placed under their threihold, to
preferve the affe&ions of the owner from wandering.
Love knots were of fingular pewter, and the number
three v as particularly obftrved in all they did. But
no good effect was expe&ed, if the ufe of thefe things
was not attended with charms or magical verfes and Love-apple,
forms of words. Spe Magic. II
Having mentioned their arts of exciting love, it
may not be amifs to take notice, that the ancients -C*8- ' .<
gined, that love excited by magic may be allayed by
misre powerful fpells and medicaments, or by applying
to demons more powerful than thofe who had been
concerned in raifing that paffion. But love infpired
without magic had no cure ; Apollo himfelf could find
no remedy, but cried out
Hei mihi quod nullis amor eft medicabilis herbis.
The antidotes againft love were generally agnus cqftus,
which has the power of weakening the generative facul¬
ty ; fprinkling the duft in which a mule had rolled her-
felf 5 tying toads in the hide of a beaft newly fiain 5 ap¬
plying amulets of minerals or herbs, which were fup¬
pofed of great efficacy in other cafes ; and invoking the
affiftance of the inferior deities. Another cure for love
was bathing in the waters of the river Selemnus *, to
which we may add the lover’s leap, or jumping down
from' the Leucadian promontory.

fides a charity fchool for 80 boys, and another for 20

is ftill a very agreeable town, with rich meadow-ground,
on the foffe, which runs here almoft parallel with the

here very extenfive.
LOUGHBRICKLAND, a town of Ireland, fitu-

miles from Dublin. The name fignifies the lake of
the fpefttled trout; and it was fo called from a lake near
it, which abounds with thofe fiffi. It confifts of one
broad ftreet, at the end of which is the parifti church,
faid to have been built by Dr Taylor when bifliop of

^eagh. that 0f Geneva in Switzerland, excepted ; being 20
Strand ra,’es i°ng an^ tS broad. The area of this lake is
computed to be 100,oco acres. It is remarkable for
a healing virtue ; and likewife for petrifying wood,
which is not only found in the water but in the adja¬
cent foil at a confiderable depth. On its lho«es fe-
veral beautiful gems have been difcovered. Its an¬
cient name was Loch Eacha, or Loch-Neach, from loch,
“ a lake,” and Neach, “ wonderful, divine, or emi¬
nent.” Its petrifying powers are not inftantaneous, as
feveral of the ancients have fuppofed, but require a
long feries of ages to bring them to perfection, and
appear to be occalioned by a fine mud or fand, which
infinuates itlelf into the pores of the wood, and which
in procefs of time becomes hard like Hone. On the
borders of this lake is Shane’s caftle, the elegant feat
of Lord O’Neil. Dr Smyth feems to doubt whether
the healing quality in this lake is not to be confined to
one fide of it, called the Jifhing-banh ; and he informs us,
that this virtue wTas difcovered in the reign of Charles
II. in the inftance of the fon of one Mr Cunningham,
w7ho had an evil which run on him in eight or ten
places j and notwithftanding all applications, feemed
incurable : at length he was perfectly healed, after
bathing in this lough about eight days. Hence that wri¬
ter gives us another derivation of the name Loch-Neach,
which (he fays) feems to him to hint at this quality ;
Neafg ox Neas, in Irilh, fig^nifying a fore or ulcer,” which
might not improbably be corrupted into Neagh; Hence
he apprehends, this lake was remarked at a much earlier
period for its healing property. As to its petrifying
power, it is mentioned by Nenius, a waiter of the 9th
century, who fays, “ Eft aliud ftagnum quod facit lig-
na durefcere an lapides. Homines autem findunt lig-

LOUGH-STRANGFORD, a lake of Ireland,
fituated in the county of Down and province of Ul-
fter. It takes its prefent name from a fmall port-
town called Strangford, feated cn the w’eft fide of the
narrow entrance into the fea. It w'as formerly known
by the name of Lough-Cone or Lough-Coyne. It is a
deep bay or inlet of the fea, about 17 miles long and
four or five broad j it goes weft as far as Downpatrick,
and north as far as Comber and New'ton, and by
computation covers 25,775 acres> Ifilh plantation
meafure. It abounds with excellent fifh, particularly
fmelts ; and off the bar there is a periodical herring
filhery in or about Auguft. The bar or entrance
into this lough is about three miles below Strang-
« ford. There is a long rock at the entrance in the
middle of the paffage, dangerous to ftrangers on ac¬
count of the current ; yet there is a broad paffage on
either fide, and deep water. The current here is very
ftrong and rapid, running at the rate of fix or feven
miles an hour. There are but few veffels that go
higher up than Strangford. A good many veffels
bound up the Channel put in here, if the wind is un¬
favourable to their paffage. The iflands in this lake
are numerous; Doftor Boat enumerates them at 260.
But from an a61ual furvey, made at the time Dr Smyth
wrote his hiftory of that county, it appears, there are
54 iflands imall and great, known by particular names, Louis,
and many others namelefs j the contents of thefe 54 Lomfiana.
iflands added together amount to 954 acres and a
half. The great and profitable manufaflure carried
on in thefe iflands, and the flat ftony coafts furround¬
ing the lake, is the burning of fea-weed into kelp,
which employs a number of hands, and has been com¬
puted to produce to the feveral proprietors a neat
profit of xoool. per annum and upwards. Four of the
iflands here are called Swan ijlands from the number
of fwans that frequent them.

in 1785, when a cenfus was taken, amounted to more
than 50,000 fouls; but different authors are of opinion
that this is much below the proper eftimate, notwith¬
ftanding the population bears no proportion to the ex¬
tent of the country. According to another eftimate
there are 89,970. The inhabitants have often attempt¬
ed to cultivate the fugar cane, but they found the cli¬
mate rather unfavourable to the culture of that plant.
They chiefly export indigo, cotton, rice, beans, myrtle,
wax, and lumber. But if the climate is unfriendly to
the fugar-cane, it is faid to be favourable to the health
of the people, and to the culture of fruits and garden
vegetables. The total value of the exports from Loui-
fiana in 1802 is faid to have amounted 102,158,000
dollars, and of the imports to about 342,000 dollars ,
above that fum.
There are but few domeftic manufafiures of any im- -
portance in Louifiana, but fuch of the inhabitants as
are denominated Acadians, manufa&ure fome cotton
into quilts and cottonades j and in the remote parts of
the province, thofe planters who are poor, are in the
habit of fpinning cloth mixed with wool for the ufe of
the negroes. In the parifh of Iberville there is a ma¬
chine for fpinning cotton, and another in the Opeloufas,
but neither of them very extenfive ; a confiderable ma¬
nufacture of cordage, twelve diftilleries for making taf-
fia, and a fugar refinery which manufactures about
200,000 lbs. of loaf fugar annually. The trade by
fea is confiderable, for in the year 1802 there entered 5

alfo confiderable from Penfacola, Mobille, and the
creeks and rivers falling into Lake Pontchartrain, from
whence (hip timber, charcoal, lime, pitch and tar, are
conveyed to New Orleans, in which about 500 (loops
and fchooners from eight to 50 tons are frequently em¬
ployed.
A return of the militia of Louifiana was made by
the baron of Carondelet to the court of Spain, which
made them amount to j 0,340 men j but in this efti-
tnate were included feveral companies of volunteers,
negroes, and even companies of privileged horfe, or ca¬
valry. There are not kbove 930 native Indians in this
vaft country, fome of whom are employed by the fettlers
as boatmen on the Red river, and much elleemed for
their friendlhip to the whites, for their bravery and
generofity.
The fortifications which have been eredfed in Louifi¬
ana fcarcely merit our attention. Fort St Louis is com¬
manded by a lieutenant-colonel, with ahandfbl of troops j
Baton Rouge is extremely ill conftrudfed, and contains
about 50 men; Fort Plaquemines, about 12 leagues
from the fea, is an irregular work built of bricks, and
badly conflrudfed, on the eaft fide of the river Miffiflip-
pi, having a ditch in front of the river, and defended
on the lower fide by a deep creek. It is defencelefs be¬
hind, as thofe by whom it was eredled had placed too
much confidence in the fw'ampinefs of the ground,
which is every day growing harder. It would be no
difficult matter to take it by efcalade, for by the negli¬
gence of the people it is fall falling into ruins. The
fmall redoubt called Fort Bourboti, is generally under
the command of a ferjeant, with a very fmall company.
Should a vtffel attempt to pafs without fending a boat
on (bore, (he would be inllantly fired upon.
When Louifiana was firft ceded to Spain, it preferv-
ed many of the regulations peculiar to France ; but the
province afterwards came to be governed by the laws
of Spain, and the ordinances formed exprefsly for the
colony. The governor’s court has a civil and military
jurifdi&ion throughout the province. That of the
lieutenant-governor has the fame extent in civil cafes
only. There are two alcades, whofe jurifdidion, civil
and criminal, extends through the city of New Orleans
and five leagues around it, where the parties have no
fuero mi/itar, or military privilege ; thofe who have
can transfer their caufes to the governor. The tribunal
of the alcade provincial has cognizance of criminal
caufes, where offences are committed in the country, or
when the criminal takes refuge there, and in other fpe-
cified cafes. The ectlefiaftical tribunal has jurifdi61ion
in all matters refpe£!ing the church.
Tl ere are no colleges in Louifiana, and but one pub¬
lic fchool, which is at New Orleans, the mafters of
which receive their falary from the king. They teach
nothing but the Spaniffi language, and there are a few
private fchools for the benefit of children. It is re¬
markable that not more than one-half of the inhabitants
are fuppofed qualified to read and write, and of thefe
it is faid that not above 200 are capable of doing it
well.

The clergy confiff of a biffiop, who does not refide Louifiana
in the province, and whofe falary of 4000 dollars is
charged on the revenue of certain biffioprics in Mexico v,
and Cuba ; two canons have each a falary of 600 dol¬
lars ; and 25 curates, five for the city of New Orleans,
and 20 for as many country pariihes, wrho receive about
400 dollars each. Thefe falaries, exclufive of that of
the biffiop, are paid by the treafury at New Orleans,
and their annual amount has been elfimated at 13,000
dollars.
Inftead of paying local taxes, each inhabitant is
bound to make and repair roads, bridges, and embank¬
ments through his own land. A duty of fix per cent,
is payable at the cuflomhoufe, on the transfer of (hip¬
ping. It is afeertained upon the fum the buyer and
feller declare to be the real confideration. As no oath
is required from either, they feldom report more than
half the price. Two per cent, is payable on legacies
and inheritances, comirig from collaterals, and exceed¬
ing 2000 dollars ; four per cent, on legacies given to
perfons who are not relatives of the teftator. A tax on
civil employments, if their falaries exceed 300 dollars.
A tax is levied of 40 dollars per annum for licenfes to
fell liquors, and fix per cent, on all imports and ex¬

the amount of all the other taxes does not exceed 6000
dollars.
The expences of the government of Louifiana are
faid to amount to 650,000 dollars, to pay which there
are 400,000 dollars fent annually from Vera Cruz, in
confequence of which deficiency the debt is faid at pre-
fent to amount to 450,000 dollars, bearing no intereff,
and depreciated 30 per cent.
Soon after Louifiana was ceded to the United States,
there were two focieties ellabliffied for the promotion
of fcience and literature, one of them at New Orleans,
and another at Natchez. The former defigns to pub-
li(h a monthly magazine for the purpofe of diffufing a
knowledge of the country, and to amufe the readers
of it with a variety of ufeful fubje&s. The latter,
which was eftabliffied in 1803, called the Miffiffippi
Society for the Acquirement and Diffemination of ufe¬
ful Knowledge, confifts of near 40 members, and has
correfpondents in various parts of the United States.
The American government has granted it a charter of
incorporation.

contains nine market places, 14 water-mills, I 26 ftreets,
16 flone bridges, and feveral handfome palaces. The
townhoufe is a venerable old building, adorned with
ftatues on the outfide •, and the churches are very hand¬
fome, particularly the collegiate church of St Peter j
but the principal ornament is the univerfity, founded
only in 1426 by John IV. duke of Brabant, with the
concurrence of Pope Martin V. It contains about 40
colleges, four of which are called Petfagogia. There
is in the number alfo an Englilh college of friars-
preachers, which owres its eftablilhment to the liberali¬
ties of Cardinal Philip Howard, brother to the duke
of Norfolk, who, before he was railed to the purple,
had been private chaplain to Queen Catherh*, con-
fort to Charles II. The Iriih have likewife a femi-
nary, erefted in part uuder the care of Eugenius Mat-
theus, titular archbilhop of Dublin, anno 1623, which
receives its appointments from the Propaganda at
Rome. Befides the above, there are two convents for
the Iriih, one of Recolledts and the other of Domini¬
cans, where divinity and the mathefis are taught. In the
laft century the number of fcholars exceeded 4000 $ but
in the year 1744 the inhabitants amounted to 12,000,
including 2000 ftudents only.—At the beginning of
the 14th century, under John III. it flourilhed con-
fiderably in the manufafture of woollen cloth : 400
houfes were then occupied by fubftantial clothiers, who
gave employment to an incredible number of weavers,
fo great, it is faid, that a bell was rung to prevent any
injuries which the children in the ftreet might receive
from the crowd and hurry on their returning from work.
In 1382, thefe weavers, however, took up arms, and
rebelled again!! theiy fovereign Prince Wencellaus,
throwing from the windows of the town hall 17 of the
aldermen and counfellors, and afterwards proceeded to
lay wrafte great part of Brabant; but being befieged
and reduced to great extremities, they fubmilfively im¬
plored his clemency ; which was granted after the exe¬
cution of fome of the principal ringleaders. The
weavers, the chief inftigators to this revolt, were ba-
nilhed, the greater part of whom took refuge in Eng¬
land 5 where they firl! introduced, or at leaft augment¬
ed very much, the woollen xnanpfadture. The town,
by this circumfiance, being almoft depopulated, the Louvain
univerfity was eltablilhed to fupply in fome meafure the II ,
lofs of the rebellious clothiers. Since that time the , 0^'^e' *
manufacture gradually declined, no cloth of any ac¬
count being made there at prefent. This impolitic
Hep of the duke Wenceflaus fent treafures to England,

ed the cloth manufacture of Limbourg, which is car¬
ried on with good advantage to this day. There is yet
Handing at Louvain part of the old drapers-hall, now-
converted into four public fchools, where leCtures in
divinity, philofophy, law, and phyfic, are given, and
the public aCts are made. Adjoining to the fchools
is the univerfity library, wdiich altogether compofe
a large pile of building. Over the door of the chief
entrance we read thefe words, Sapientia cedificavit Jibi
domum. The principal church is collegiate, dedicated to
St Peter, which had formerly three very large towers
with elevated fpires, one confiderably higher than the
two collaterals; thefe were blown down in the year re¬
corded by this chronogram, oMnla CaDVnt. From
the name of this church the burghers have acquired
the nickname of Petermen, whofe anceHors having cloth¬
ed the back by a noble woollen manufacture, the mo¬
dern Petermen now compofe an ignoble mixture for the
belly, called after them Peterman beer, a fort of whitilh
muddy ale, which they notwithflanding fend in large
quantities to all parts of the country, as well as to Hol¬
land, by the canals. Louvain was anciently the capital
of the province, long before Bruffels had any claim to
that title. It was'taken by the French in 1792, after¬
wards loft, and retaken in 1794. E. Long. 4. 40. N.

LOW-bell, in birding, a name given to a bell, by
means of which they take birds in the night, in open
champaign countries, and among Hubble, in Octo¬
ber. The method is to go out about nine o’clock at
night in a Hill evening, when the air is mild and the
moon does not Ihine. The low-bell Ihould be of a deep
and hollow found, and of fuch a fize that a man may
conveniently carry it in one hand. The perfon who
carries it is to make it toll all the way he goes, as
nearly as may be, in that manner in which the bell on
the neck of a Iheep tolls as it goes on and feeds..
There muft alfo be a box made like a large lanthorn,.
about a foot fquare, and lined with tin, but with one
fide open. Two or three great lights are to be fet in
this; and the box is to be fixed to the perfon’s breaft,
with the open fide forwards, fo that the light may be
caft forward to a great diftance. It will fpread as it
goes out of the box; and will diftinCtly ftiow to the per- 3

net of about three or four feet fquare, faftened to a long
flick or pole ; and on whichever fide any bird is feen

When the net is over the bird, the perfon wyho laid it

Some people are fond of going on this fcheme

LOW, East, a town of Cornwall in England,
231 miles from London, in the pod road from Ply¬
mouth. It is an ancient borough by prefcription,
made a corporation by charter of Queen Elizabeth,
confiding of nine burgeffes (one of w-hom is yearly
chofen mayor), a recorder, aldermen, &c. ; and the
mayor, magidrates, and freemen, who are about 68,
choofe the members of parliament. This being a ma¬
nor of the duchy of Cornwall, was fettled by Ming
William on Lord Somers, and is now held by the cor¬
poration at the fee-farm rent of 20s. a-year. It is feat-
ed pretty commodioufiy on a creek of the fea, over
which there is a large done bridge, fupported by 15
arches, which leads to Wed Low, danding between
two hills. The chief benefit which the inhabitants
have is in their filhery. Here is a battery of four
guns and a fmall chapel.
Loiv, Weft, called alfo Port Pigham, a town of
Cornwall, divided from Ead Low by a done bridge
of 15 arches over the river Low, from whence both
towns receive their name, as the river does from the
lownefs of its current between its high banks. The
corporation, by charter of Queen Elizabeth, confids
of 12 burgeffes, one of whom is annually chofen
mayor, and, with the other burgeffes, has power to
choofe a deward. Its members, whom it has fent to
parliament ever fince the 6th of Edward VI. are eleft-
ed by the corporation and freemen, who are about
60. There was a chapel of eafe here in the reign of
Henry VIII. which was afterwards converted into a
towmhall; and the towm lying in the parifh of Tal-
land, the people go thither to church. There is a
pretty little harbour here ; near the mouth of which
is a fmall idand called St George's, which abounds
with fea pies. The river here is navigable for veffels
of 100 tons.

tome. He, with Dr Willis, in 1674, difcovered the v--
medicinal waters at A(hop in Northampton (hire j
which, upon their recommendation, became very much
frequented. In 1666 he followed Dr Willis to Lon¬
don j pradtifed phyfic under him *, and became fellow
of the Royal Society, and of the College of Phyficians.
In 1669 he publifiied his TraElatus de Corde; and, af¬
ter the death of Dr Willis in 1675, he was edeemed
the mod eminent phyfician in London. Upon the
breaking out of the Popilh plot in 1678, fays Mr

LOWERING, among diilillers, a term ufed to
exprefs the debafing the drength of any fpirituous
liquor, by mixing water with it. The dandard and
marketable price of thefe liquors is fixed in regard to
a certain drength in them called proof; this is that
drength which makes them, when diaken in a phial or
poured from on high into a glafs, retain a froth or
crown of bubbles for fome time. In this date, fpirits
confid of about half pure or totally inflammable fpirit,
and half water; and if any foreign or home fpirits are
to be expofed to fale, and are found to have that
proof wanting, fcarce any body will buy it till it has
been diddled again and brought to that drength j and
if it is above that drength, the proprietor ufually adds
water to it to bring it down to that dandard. See the
article Proof.
There is another kind of lowering among the re¬
tailers of fpirituous liquors to the vulgar, by reducing
it under the dandard proof. Whoever has the art of
doing tlfis without dedroying the bubble proof, which
is eafily done by means of fome addition that gives a
greater tenacity to the parts of the fpirits, will de¬
ceive all that judge by this proof alone. In this cafe,

LOWTH, William, D. D. a learned divine, born
at London in 1661, was the fon of an apothecary, and
took his degrees at Oxford. His eminent worth and
learning recommended him to Dr Mew bifliop of
Wincheder, who made him his chaplain, gave him
two livings in Hampfliire, and conferred on him a
prebend in the cathedral of Wincheder. He acquired
an unufual fliare of critical learning. Thus fituated
in life, the labours of Mr Lowth appear to have been
driflly confined within the limits of his own province,
and applied folely to the peculiar duties of his func¬
tion : yet, in order that he might acquit himfelf the
better in theology, he had purfued his ftudies with a
more general and extenfive view. Few7 were more
deeply verfed in critical learning ; there being fcarcely
any ancient author, Greek or Latin, profane or eccle-
fiadical, efpecially the latter, but wrhat he had read
with accuracy, conflantly accompanying his reading
with critical and philological remarks. Of his col-
leftions in this way he was upon all occafions very
communicative. Hence his notes on Clemens Alexan¬
drians, which are to be met with in Potter’s edition
of that father. Hence his remarks on Jofephus, com-

The author of Bibliotheca Biblica was indebted ^to him
for the fame kind of affiftance. Chandler, late bifhop
of Durham, while engaged in his “ Defence of Chrilti-
anity, from the Prophecies of the Old Teftament, a-
gainft the Difcourfe of the Grounds and Realons of
the Chriftian Religion,” and in his “ Vindication of
the Defence, in anfwer to The Scheme of Literal
Prophecy confidered,” held a conftant correfpondence
with him, and confulted him upon many difficulties
that occurred in the courfe of that work. The moft
valuable part of his character was that which leaft ap¬
peared in the eyes of the world, the private and re¬
tired part, that of the good Chriftian and the ufeful
parifh prieft. His piety, his diligence, his hofpitali-
ty and beneficence, rendered his life highly exem¬
plary, and greatly enforced his public exhortations.
He married Margaret, daughter of Robert Pitt, Efq.
of Blandford, by whom he had two fons and three
daughters. (See the next article). Pie died in 1732,
and was baried by his own orders in the churchyard
at Buriton. He publiftied, 1. A Vindication of the
Divine Authority and Infpiration of the Old and New

of the Ploly Scriptures j 3. Commentaries on the Pro¬
phets ; and other works.
LoWTH, Robert, D. D. fecond fon of the preced¬
ing Dr William Lowtb, and bilhop fucceflively of
St David’s, Oxford, and London, was born on the
29th of November 1710, probably at Buriton in the
county of Plants. He received the rudiments of his
education at Winchefter college, where his fchool ex-
ercifes were diftinguilhed by uncommon elegance *,
and having refided the requifite number of years in
that feminary, in 1730 he fucceeded on the founda¬
tion at New College, Oxford. He took the degree
of M. A. June 8. 1737* Though his abilities muft
have been known to thofe with whom he was connect¬
ed, he was not forward to appear before the world as a
writer. At Oxford he continued many years improv¬
ing his talents, with little notice from the great, and
with preferment fo fmall as to have at prefent efcaped
the diftinCt recolleCtion of fome of his contemporaries.
He was not, however, fuffered to languifh for ever
in obfcurity. His genius and his learning forced them-
felves upon the notice of the illuftrious fociety of
which he was a member j and he was placed in a fta-
tion where he was eminently qualified to ftrine. In
1741 he was eleCled by the univerfity to the profef-
forlhip of poetry, re-elecled in 1743* an^ whilft he
held that office he read his admirable leClures De facra
poeji Hebneorum. In 1744 BHhop Hoadley collated
him to the redlory of Ovington in the county of
Hants *, added to it, nine years afterwards, the reftory
of Eaft Weedhay in the fame county ; and in the in¬
terim railed him to the dignity of archdeacon of Win¬
chefter. Thefe repeated favours he fome years after¬
wards acknowledged in the following manly and re-
fpeCtful terras of gratitude : “ This addrefs, My Lord,
is not more neceifary on account of the fubjeCf, than
it is in refpedl: of the author. Your Lordihip, unfo-
liclted and unf lked, called him from one of thofe col-

leges to a ftation of the firft dignity in your diocefe, Lowth.
and took the earlieft opportunity of accumulating your
favour upon him, and of adding to that dignity a luit-
able fupport. Thefe obligations he is now the more
ready thus publicly to acknowledge, as he is removed
out of the reach of further favours of the like kind.
And though he hath relinquilhed the advantages lo
generoufty conferred on him, yet he (hall always efteem
himfelf highly honoured in having once enjoyed the
patronage of the great advocate of civil and religious
liberty.”'
On the 8th of July 1754 the univerfity of Oxford
conferred upon him the degree of D. D. by diploma •,
an honour which, as it is never granted but to diilin-
guiftied merit, was probably conferred on Mr Lowth
in confequence of his preledlions ©n the Plebrew poetry,
which had then been lately publilhed. Having in 1749
travelled with Lord George and Lord Frederick Ca-
vendifh, he had a claim upon the patronage of the
Devonftiire family j and in I755> t^ie ^ate ^u^-e being
then lord lieutenant of Ireland, Dr Low'th w7ent to
that kingdom as his grace’s firft chaplain. Soon after
this appointment he wTas offered the biftiopric of Li¬
merick j but preferring a lefs dignified ftation in his
own country, he exchanged it with Dr Leflie, pre¬
bendary of Durham and redtor of Sedgefield, for thefe
preferments. In November 1765 he was chofen F. R. S.
In June 1766 he wras, on the death of Dr Squire,
preferred to the biftiopric of St David’s ; which, in the
Odtober followung, he refigned for that of Oxford,
vacant by the tranflation of Biftiop Hume to Salifbury.
In April 1777, he was tranftated to the fee of Lon¬
don, vacant by the death of Biftiop Terrick ; and in
1783 he decliAed the offer of the primacy of all England.
Having been long afflidled with the ftone, and having
long borne the fevereft fufferings of pain and ficknefs
with the moft exemplary fortitude and refignation, this
great and good man died at Fulham, Nov. 3. 17^7 5
and on the 12th his remains were privately interred in
a vault at Fulham church, near thofe of his predecef-
for. He had married in 1752, Mary, the daughter of
Laurence Jackfon of Chrift-church, Hants, Efq. by
whom he had two fons and five daughters. His lady
and two children only furvived him.
His literary charafler may be eftimated from the
value and the importance of his works ; in the account
of w hich we may begin with his Prele&tons on the He¬
brew Poetry. The choice of fo interefting a fubje£t
naturally attracted general attention j and the work
has been read with equal applaufe abroad and at home.
In thefe preledfions the author has acquitted himfelf
in the moft mafterly manner, as a poet, a critic, and
a divine ; and fuch is the claffic purity of his Latin
ftyle, that though we have read the work with the
clofeft attention, and with no other view than to dif-
cover, if poflible, an Anglicifm in the compofition,
we never found a fingle phrafe to which, we believe,
a critic of the Auguftan age could poffibly have ob¬
jected. This is an excellence to which neither Milton
nor Johnfon has attained •, to which indeed no other
Englifti writer of Latin with whom we are acquainted
has attained, unlefs perhaps Atterbury muft be ex¬
cepted. To the preledlions was fubjoined a ftiort con¬
futation of Bilhop Hare’s fyftem of Hebrew metre ;
which occafioned a Latin letter from Dr Edwards of
I i Clare-half,
LOW
Clare-hall, Cambridge, to Dr Lowth, in vindication
of the Harian metre. To this the author of the
prele61ions replied in a larger confutation, in which Bi-
fliop Hare’s fyItem is completely overthrown, and the
fallacy upon which it was built accurately inveftigated.
After much attentive confideration, Bilhop Lowth has
pronounced the metre of the Hebrews to be perfectly ir¬
recoverable.
In 17 5 8 he publithed The life of William of Wyke-
ham, hijhop of Winch eft er, with a dedication to Bilhop
Hoadley ; which involved him in a difpute concerning
a decihon which that bilhop had lately made refpedting
the wardenfhip of Winchelter college. This contro-
verfy w*as on both fides carried on with fuch abilities,
that, though relating to a private concern, it may yet
be read, if not with pleafure, at lead; with improvement.
The life of Wykeham is drawn from the moft authentic
fources *, and affords much information concerning the
manners, andfome of the public tranfaclions, of the period
in wdiich Wykeham lived, whilft it difplays forne private
intelligence refpeCing the two literary focieties of which
he ryas the founder. In thefe two focieties Dr Lowth
was educated, and he gratefully exprefles his obligations
to them.
In 1762 was fir ft publi fined his Short IntroduElion to
Englijh Grammar, which has fince gone through many
editions. It was originally deftgned only for private
and dorneftic ufe : but its judicious remarks being too
valuable to be confined to a few, the book was given to
the world ; and the excellence of its method, which
teaches what is right by fhowing what is wrong, has
infured public approbation and very general ufe. In
1765 Dr Lowth was engaged with Bilhop Warburton
in a controverfy, which made much noife at the time,
which attradled the notice even of royalty, and of
v which the memory is ftill recent. If we do not wilh
to dwell on the particulars of this eontroverfy, it is
becaufe violent literary contention is an evil, which,
though like other war it may fometimes be unavoid¬
able, is yet always to be regretted •, and becaufe the
charaflers of learned, ingenious, and amiable men,
never appear to lefs advantage than under the form
'which that ftate of hoftility obliges them to affume.
The two combatants indeed engaged with erudition
and ingenuity fuch as is feldom brought into conflidl )
but it appears that, in the opinion of Dr Johnfon,
Warbnrton had the moft fcholaftic learning, and that
Lowth was the moft correct fcholar ; that, in their con¬
ceit with each other, neither of them had much argu¬
ment, and that both were extremely abufive. We
have heard, and we hope it is true, that they were af¬
terwards reconciled, and exprelfed mutual regret for
the violence of their paft condutft.
In 1778 Bilhop Lowth publilhed his lart great work,
Tranjlation of Ifaiah. To his literary and theological
abilities, the tranllator joined the moft critical know¬
ledge ©f the chara&er and fpirit of the eaftern poetry 5
and, accordingly, the prophecies of Ifaiah (xvhich,
though almoft always fublime or elegant, are yet fome¬
times obfeure) were tranllated in a manner adequate
to the higheft expeftations of the public. Several
©ccafional difeourfes, which the bilhop, by his ftation,
was at different times called upon to deliver, were of
courfe publilhed, and are all worthy of their excellent
author 3 but there is one on the kingdom of God, on the
LOW
extenfion and progrelTive improvement of Chiift’s re¬
ligion, and on the means of promoting thefe by the
advancement of religious knowledge, by freedom of
inquiry, by toleration, and mutual charity, which
may be diftinguilhed above the reft, as exhibiting a
moft comprehenfive view of the fucceftive ftates of the
Chriftian church, and containing the trueft principles
of Chriftianity.
Of the bilhop’s poetical pieces, none difplay greater
merit than Verfes on the Genealogy of Chrift, and the
Choice of Hercules, both written very early in his life.
He wrote a fpirited Imitation of an Ode of Horace,
applied to the alarming lituation of this country in
3 745 5 and likewife fome Verfes on the death of Frede¬
ric prince of Wales, with a few fmaller poems. The
following infeription on the tomb of his daughter,
beautifully difplays his paternal affedlion and clallic
tafte. As it is (hort, and, in our opinion, has all the
merit of the ancient epitaph, the reader will probably
be pleafed with fuch a fpeeimen of his lordftiip’s Lati-
nity.

Learning and tafte, however, did not conftitute Bifhop
Lowth’s higheft excellence. Eulogium itfelf can fcarce-
ly afeend to extravagance when fpeaking of him
either as a private man or as a paftor of the church of
Chrift. His amiable manners rendered him an orna¬
ment to his high ftation, whilft they endeared him to
all with whom he converfed 3 and his zeal for the in-
terefts of true religion made him eager to promote to
places of truft and dignity fuch clergymen as he knew
were beft qualified to fill them. Of his modefty,
gentlenefs, and pleafing converfation, we have the tefti-
mony of one whofe decifion will hardly be difputed.—
“ It would anfvver no end (fays Bilhop Warburton) to
tell you what I thought of the author of Hebrew poe¬
try, before I faw him. But this I may fay, I was never
more furprifed, when I did fee him, than to find him of
fuch amiable and gentle manners, of fo modeft, fenlible,
and difengaged a deportment.” He united, indeed,
in an eminent degree, the qualities of the gentleman
with thofe of the fcholar : he converfed with elegance,
as he wrote with accuracy. As a hufhand, a father,
or the mafter of a family, he was as nearly faultlefs as
the imperfections of humanity will eafily permit. His
temper, when roufed by what he thought improper con-
duCf was indeed fufceptible of confiderable warmth 3
but if he could be highly offended, upon a flight con-
ceftion he could likewife forgive. His heart was ten¬
der and fympathetic. He poffeffed a mind which felt
its own ftrength, and decided on whatever came before
it with promptitude and firmnefs. In thofe trials
where affliction was to be fuffei ed or fubdued, he be¬
haved as a man and a Chriftian. His piety had no
tinCIure of morofenefs 3 his charity no leaven of often-
tation. To his whole diocefe he was endeared by
his laudable diferetion and his ufeful zeal. To the
world he was a benefit by bis exemplary life and his
fplendid abilities. And whilft virtue and learning are
reverenced

LUEEC, a city and port-town of Germany, in the
circle of Lower Saxony and duchy of Holllein, in
E. Long. io. 35. N. Lat. 54. 20. It Hands at the
conflux of feveral rivers, the largeft of which is the
Trave, 12 miles from the Baltic, where it has a fine
harbour, and 40 north-eaft of Hamburgh. By the Stec-
kenitz, another of thofe rivers, it has a communica¬
tion with the Elbe, and confequently with the Ger¬
man ocean. The city lies on the fide of a hill, with
the Trave, increafed by the Steckenitz on the one fide,
and the Wakenitz on the other; and is ftrongly for¬
tified with baflions, moats, wxdls, and ramparts ; the
laft of which are planted with trees, and form an a-
greeable walk. Lubec being formerly the chief of the
Hanfe towns, was very powerful in confequence of
the vaft trade it carried on ; but a great part of that
trade is now transferred to Hamburgh ; however, it is
Hill faid to employ 150 of its own fhips, and has a
great fhare of the Baltic trade. It is about two miles
in length, and more than one in breadth. The houfes
are all of ftone, but old fafliioned. Several of the
ftreets have on each fide rows of lime trees, with canals
in the middle, like thofe of Holland. The public
ftruftures confift of the ancient cathedral of the bifliop-
ric ol Lubec, and feveral other Lutheran churches ; a
nunnery for 22 ladies, with an abbefs and priorefs; a
poor-houfe, an alms-houfe, and houfe of correction ;
an orphan-houfe, an hofpital dedicated to the Holy
Gholt ; a houfe in which poor travellers are entertain¬
ed three days, and then fent forward with a pafs ; but
fuch as happen to be fick, are provided with all necef-
faries till they recover or die; the city armoury, a
grammar fchool of feven clafl'es, the Calvinift church,
and the Popifh chapel. The deputies of the Hanle-
towas tued to meet here formerly in the tcwnhoufe.
An alliance ftiil fubfifts between Lubec, Hamburgh,
and Bremen ; and thefe cities, under the name of
Hanfe towns, negotiate treaties with foreign powers.
Flere are divers manufactures, and the city’s territory
is about 60 miles in cempafs. In the diet of the em¬
pire Lubec is poffelfed of the third feat among the Rhe-
nifli imperial cities ; and among thofe of the circle, has
the firfi. In the matricula, its affelfment is 480 flo¬
rins, and to the chamber of Wetzlar it pays 557 rix-
dollars and 88 kruitzers. The chy is a republic with¬
in itfelf, and both makes and executes laws in regard
to civil and criminal matters, &c. A father and fon,
or two brothers, cannot be in the regency at the fame
time. The famous league of the Hanfe-towns was be¬
gun here in 1164. This city had its charter of privi¬
leges from the emperor Frederic II. Formerly it car¬
ried on wars, both offenfive and defenfive, for feveral
years, not only again!! the dukes of Mecklenburg, but
again!! the kings of Sweden and Denmark ; particu¬
larly in 1428, when it fitted out 250 fhips of force
again!! Eric X. king of Denmark. There are about
20 churches in Lubec, with lofty fleeples or fpires.
The Trave brings fhips of burden into the very heart
of the city ; but the large!! unload at Travemunde,
i. e. the mouth of the Trave,.eight or ten miles di-
llant. Formerly it is faid to have employed no lefs
than 600 flops. In the famous cellar here, it is faid,
there is wine 200 years old. The church of St Ma¬
ry’s, a noble lofty pile, is fupported by tall pillars,
all of one Hone each, and has a high fpire, covered
with gilt lead. The town’s garrifon confifts of about
700 or 800 men. The revenue of its Lutheran biftiop,
though he is a prince of the empire, is faid not to ex¬
ceed 3000I. Lubec fell into the hands of the French
in 1806, when Bonaparte overran the Pruflian domi¬
nions ; and many of the inhabitants were cruelly maf-
facred and plundered.

from the German princes for his Sacinian brethren.
Flis labours, however, were ineffe&ual; being himfelf
peifecuted by the Lutheran minifters, and baniflied
from place to place ; until at length he was baniflied
out of the world, with his two daughters, by poifon,
his wife narrowly efcaping, in 1675. We have of his

LUCANUS, Marcus Axnjeus, a Latin poet, born
at Corduba in Spain, about A. C. 39. He was the
fon of Annaeus Mela, the youngeft brother of Seneca 5
and was conveyed to Roms from the place of his na¬
tivity at the age of eight months j a circumtlance, as
his more indulgent critics obferve, which fufficiently
refutes the cenfure of thofe who conlider his language
as provincial. At Rome he was educated under the
Stoic Cornutus, fo w’armly celebrated by his difciple
Perlius the fatirift, who was the intimate friend of our
poet. In the clofe of his education, Lucan is faid to
have paffed fome time at Athens. On his return to
Rome he rofe to the oflice of quseftor, before he had
attained the legal age. He was afterwards enrolled
among the augurs j and married a lady of noble birth,
and of a moll amiable charafrer. Lucan had for fome
time been admitted to familiarity with Nero, when
the emperor chofe to contend for poetical honours by
the public recital of a poem he had compofed on Niobe j
and fome verfes of his imperial produ&ion are fup¬
pofed to be preferved in the firft fatire of Perfius. Lu¬
can had the hardinefs to repeat a poem on Orpheus,
in competition with that of Nero j and, what is more
remarkable, the judges of the conteil were jufi: and
bold enough to decide againft the emperor. From
hence Nero became the perfecutor of his fuccefsful ri¬
val, and forbade him to produce any poetry in public.

of his narration, Tacitus alleges a charge againft our Li
poet, which, if it tvere true, muft lead us to deleft
him as the mod abjeft of mankind. The hiftorian af-
ferts, that Lucan, when accufed of the confpiracy, for
fome time denied the charge j but corrupted at la ft by
a promife of impunity, and deftrous to atone for the
tardinefs of his confeflion, accufed his mother Atilla
as his accomplice. This circumftance is fo improbable
in itfelf, and fo little confonant to the general charaffer
of Lucan, that fome writers have treated it with con¬
tempt, as a calumny invented by Nero, to vilify the
object of his envious abhorrence. But the name of
Tacitus has given fuch an air of authority to the ftory,
that it may feem to deferve a more ferious difcuflion,
particularly as there are two fubfequent events related
by the fame hiftorian, which have a tendency to inva¬
lidate the accufation fo injurious to our poet. The
events I mean are, the fate of Annteus, and the efcape
of Atilla, the two parents of Lucan. The former died
in confequence of an accufation brought againft him,
after the death of his fon, by Fabius Romanus, who
had been an intimate with Lucan, and forged fome let¬
ters in his name, with the defign of proving his father
concerned in the confpiracy. Thefe letters were pro¬
duced to Nero, who fent them to Annaeus, from an
eager deftre, fays Tacitus, to get poffeftion of his wealth.
From this fa£t two inferences may be drawn, accord¬
ing to the different lights in which it may be confider-
ed :—If the accufation againft Annaeus was juft, it is
clear that Lucan had not betrayed his father, and he ap¬
pears the lefs likely to have endangered by his con-
feftion the life of a parent, to whom he owed a ftill ten¬
derer regard :—If Annaeus was not involved in the con¬
fpiracy, and merely put to death by Nero for the fake
of his treafure, we may the more readily believe, that
the tyrant who murdered the father from avarice, might
calumniate the fon from envy. But the efcape of A-
tilla affords us the ftrongeft reafon to conclude that
Lucan was perfe&ly innocent of the abjecft and unna¬
tural treachery of which Tacitus has fuppofed him
guilty. Had the poet really named his mother as an
accomplice, wrould the vindictive and fanguinary Nero
have fpared the life of a woman whofe family he de-
tefted, particularly when other females were put to death
for their (hare in the confpiracy ? That Atilla was not
in that number, the hiftorian himfelf informs us in the
following remarkable fentence, “ Atilla mater Annaei
Lucani, fine abfolutione, fine fupplicio, diffimulata j”
thus tranflated by Gordon : “ The information againft
Atilla, the mother of Lucan, w7as diffembled ; and,
without being cleared, fhe efcaped unpunifhed.”
The preceding remarks will, our author hopes, vin¬
dicate to every candid mind the honour of Lucan,
whofe firmnefs and intrepidity of charafter are indeed
very forcibly difplayed in that pifture of his death
which Tacitus himfelf has given us. He was condemned
to have his veins cut, as his uncle Seneca had before
him. Lucan, “ while his blood iffued in ftreams, per¬
ceiving his feet and hands to grow cold and ftifl'en,
and life to retire by little and little from the extremities,
while his heart was ftill beating with vital warmth,
and his faculties ftowife impaired, recolleClcd fome
lines of his own, which deferibed a wounded foldier
expiring in a manner that refembled this. The lines
themfelves he rehearfed ^ and they were the laft words
he
LUC [2
Lueanus. he ever uttered.” The critics differ concerning the
verfes of the Pharfalia which the author quoted in fo
memorable a manner. The two paffages he is fuppof-
ed to have repeated are the following ; of which Lip-
fius contends for the latter.

Such was the death of Lucan before he had completed
his 27th year.—_His wife, Polla Argentaria, is faid to
have tranfcribed and corredfted the three firft books of
the Pharfalia after his death. It is much to be re¬
gretted (Mr Hay ley obferves) that we pollefs not the
poem which he wrote on the merits of this amiable
and accomplifhed woman •, but her name is immorta¬
lized by two furviving poets of that age. The vene¬
ration which ftie paid to the memory of her hufband
is recorded by Martial j and more poetically deferibed
in that pleaftng and elegant little produttion of Statius,
Genethliacon Lucam, a poem faid to have been written
at the requeft of Argentaria. The author, after in¬
voking the poetical deities to attend the ceremony,
touches with great delicacy and fpirit on the compo-
fitions of Lucan’s childhood, which are loft, and the
Pharfalia, the produftion of his early youth : he then
pays a fhort compliment to the beauty and talents of
Argentaria ; laments the cruel fate which deprived her
fo immaturely of domeftic happinefs; and concludes
with an addrefs to the (hade of Lucan, which, with
Mr Hayley’s tranflation, we (hall fubjoin in a Note,
as it feems to furnifh a ftrong prefumption of Lucan’s
innocence in regard to 'one of the accufations mention¬
ed above (a). “ Had he been really guilty of bafely

Taucamis endangering the life of hh mother (fays Mr Hayley),
ii . it is not probable that his wife would have honoured
llcAua' , his memory with fuch enthufiaftic veneration ; or that
Statius, in verfes defigned to do him honour, would
have alluded to the mother of Nero. If his chara&er
as a man has been injured by the hiftorian (continues
Mr Hayley), his poetical reputation has been treated
not lefs injurioufly by the critics. Quintilian, by a
frivolous diftindlion, difputes his title to be claffed
among the poets ; and Scaliger fays, with a brutality
of language difgraceful only to himfelf, that he feems
rather to barh than to Jing. But thefe infults may ap¬
pear amply compenfated, when we remember, that in
the moil poliihed nations of modern Europe, the molt
elevated and poetic fpirits have been his warmed: ad¬
mirers •, that in France he was idolized by Corneille,
and in England tranflated by Rowe.—The fevered
cenfures on Lucan have proceeded from thofe who
have unfairly compared his language to that of Virgil :
but how unjuft and abfurd is fuch a comparifon ! it is
’comparing an uneven block of porphyry, taken rough
from the quarry, to the moft beautiful fuperficies of
polifhed marble. How differently ftiould we think of
Virgil as a poet, if we poffeffed only the verfes which
he wrote at that period of life when Lucan compofed
his Pharfalia ! In the difpofition of his fubjeft, in the
propriety and elegance of diftion, he is undoubtedly
far inferior to Virgil 5 but if we attend to the bold
originality of his defign, and to the vigour of his fen-
timents; if we cOnfrder the Pharfalia as the rapid and
uncorre&ed Iketch of a young poet, executed in an age
when the fpirit of his countrymen was broken, and
their tafle in literature corrupted ; it may "juftly be
efteemed as one of the moft noble and moft wonderful
productions of the human mind.”—Lucan wrote feve-
ral poems j but we have none remaining beftde his
Pharfalia, of which an excellent Englifti verfion has
been given by Mr Nicholas Rowe.

LUCARIA, a feaft celebrated at Rome on the
rSth of July, in memory of the flight of the Romans
into a great wood, where they found an afylum, and
faved themfelves from deftruClion. This wood, in
■ which they found proteClion, was fituated between the
Tyber and the Via Solaria. The enemies from whom
the Romans fled were the Gauls.— On this feftival,
Plutarch tells us, it was cuftcmary to pay the adders,
•and fuch as contributed to the public amufement, with
the money arifing from the felling of wood. This
money was called lucar. It is obvious, from what has
been obferved, that lucar and lucana are derived from
lucus, a grove.
LUCAS Jacobs, an eminent artift, more gene¬
rally known by the name of Lucas van Lrydew, or
Hugenfe, was born at Leyden in 1494. He received
his firft inftruclions in the art of painting from his fa¬
ther Hugues Jacobs •, but completed his ftudies in
the fchool of Cornelius Engelbrecht. He gained
much money by his profeftion } and being of a gene¬
rous turn of mind, he fpent it freely, dreffed well, and
lived in a fuperior ftyle. It is faid, that, a few years
before his death, he made a tour into Zealand and
Brabant ; and during his journey, a painter of Flulh-
ing, envious of his great abilities, gave him poifon at
an entertainment •, which, though very flow, was too
fatal in its effedd, and put an end to his life, after fix
years languifhing under its cruel influence. Others,
denying the ftory of the poifon, attribute his death
to his inceffant induftry. The fuperiority of this
artift’s genius manifefted itfelf in his infancy : for his
works, even from the age of nine, w7ere fo excellent
as to excite the admiration of all cotemporary artifts j
and when he w'as about 15, he painted a St Hubert,
wEich gained him great applaufe. His tone of colour¬
ing (Mr Pilkington obferves) is good j his attitudes
(making a reafonable allowance for the ftiff German
tafte) are wTell chofen j his figures have a confiderable
expreffion in their faces, and his piddures are very
highly finifhed. He endeavoured to proportion the
ftrength of his colouring to the different degrees of
diftance in which his objefts were placed : for in that
early time, the true principles of perfpedtive were but
little known, and the praftice of it was much lefs
obferved. In the town hall at Leyden, the moft ca¬
pital piddure of Lucas, the fubjeft of which is the Laft
Judgement, is preferved wfith great care •, the magi-
ftrates having refilled very large fums which have been
offered for it.
This artift painted not only in oil, but alfo in dif-
temper and upon glgfs. Nor w-as he lefs eminent for
his engraving than for his painting. He carried on a
familiar and friendly correfpondence with Albert Du-
rer, who w7as his cotemporary ; and, it is faid, that as
regularly as Albert Durer publilhed one print, Lu¬
cas publilhed another, without the leaft jealoufy on
either fide, or wilh to depreciate each other’s merit.
And wrhen Albert came into Holland upon his travels,
he w^as received by Lucas in a moft cordial and affec¬
tionate manner. His ftyle of engraving, however, ac¬
cording to Mr Strutt, differed confiderably from that of
Albert Durer, “ and feems evidently to have been found¬
ed upon the works of Ifrael van Mechlen. His prints
are very neat and dear, but without any powerful
effed. The ftrokes are as fine and delicate upon the
Lucas.
objeds in the front, as upon thofe in the diftances;
and this want of variety, joined with the feeblenefs of
the maffes of ftiadow, give his engravings, with all
their neatnefs, an unfinifhed appearance, much unlike
the firm fubftantial effed which we find in the works
of Albert Durer. He was attentive to the minutiae
of his art. Every thing is carefully made out in his
prints, and no part of them is negleded. He gave great
charader and expreffion to the heads of his figures j
but on examination of his works, we find the fame
heads
1
LUC [2
Lucas, heads too often repeated. The hands and feet are
v rather mannered than corredl; and when he attempted
to draw the naked figure, he fucceeded but very indif¬
ferently. He affected to make the folds of his dra¬
peries long and Howing ; but his female figures are
frequently fo exceffxvelyffoaded with girdles, bandages,
and other ornamental trappings, that much of the ele¬
gance of the defign is loft. He engraved on wood, as
well as on copper ; but his works on t *3 former are by
no means numerous. They are, however, very fpirited 5
though not equa?, upon the whole, to thole of his friend
Albert. The prints of this mafter are pretty numerous,
but very feldom met with complete ; efpecially fine
impreflions of them. For though they are, generally
fpeaking, executed with the graver only, yet, from
the delicacy of the execution, they foon fuffered in the
printing. Of his engravings the few following may
be mentioned as among the principal, r. Mahomet

figureJleahng hisfiivord, a middling-fized upright plate,

very fine print ; the exprefiion of Saul’s countenance,
in particular, is admirable. 9, A print known by
the name of Ulefipiegle, which is the fcarceft of all the
works of this mafter. It is in the colledtion of the
king of France j and faid by Marolles, and other
mailers, to be unique. But Bafan informs us, that
M. Mariette had alfo an impreffion of this plate ; and
it has been fince found in one or two other colledfions.
It reprefents a travelling bagpiper with his family ;
himfelf playing as he goes along, and carrying two
cnildren in a balket at his back j his wife trudging by
his fide, fupporting with one hand an infant on her
fhoulder, and with the other leading an afs loaded
with two balkets, having two children in each ; and
another child going before, with a little dog, completes
the lingular groupe. This rare print is dated 1520,
and is knovvn to have been fold for 16 louis d’ors. 
It is nearly inches high by 4^- broad ; and has
been twice copied. One of the copies is the reverfe
way : but the other is the fame way with the origi¬
nal ; and though not fo well executed, might without
a comparifon be miftaken for it.

of handfome houfes. The number of its inhabitants is

ing 15 or. 16 leagues long, and eight broad. The po¬

pafture, furniihing cattle, hides, cheefe, and butter,
for.exportation. All the north part is fertile in grain,
fruit, and hay ; fupplying fufficient for the confump-

canton profeifes the Roman Catholic religion. The
pope’s nuncio, with the title of legate a latere, ufually
refides at Lucerne.—They threw off the Auftrian yoke
in 1352, and by entering into a perpetual alliance
with the three ancient cantons, they gave fuch weight

all the efforts of the enemy at the bloody battle of
Sempach.
The town of Lucerne is fituated at the extremity of
a moll beautiful lake of the fame name, where the
river Reufs iffues from it. The buildings are ancient,
and the llreets narrow ; nor is Lucerne populous in
proportion to its extent, the inhabitants being only
between 3000 and 4000. Since this is the great palfage
to Italy by Mount St Gothard, and the merchandife
which palfes the Alps on mules, and is to be tranf-
ported by the rivers Reufs, Aar, and Rhine, is all
depofited here, it might have a flourifhing trade if
arts and manufadfures were attended to. The Reufs
feparates the town into two unequal parts, w-hich are
connedled by three bridges : one wide for carriages j
and two narrow covered ones for foot paffengers : be-
fxdes thefe, there is a fourth over an arm of the lake,
to pafs to the cathedral. Three of thefe bridges have
old bad paintings of the Dance of Death, and the Hi-
llory of the Bible, and of Swifferland. They make
a commodious dry walk for the inhabitants.—Of re¬
ligious edifices, the principal are the cathedral, or col¬
legiate church of St Leger; the convent of Corde¬
liers j the college of the Jefuits; the convent of Capu¬
chins , and two convents of nuns. Of the fecular
buildings, the hotel de ville is the principal. The
arfenal is well furnilhed. The water tower is remark¬
able only for its pofition and antiquity ; it is faid to
have been a pharos or lighthoufe. What greatly
attradls the notice of mod llrangers is, a plan in
relief of part of the cantons of Lucerne, Zug, and
Berne, and the whole of Schw'eitz, Uri, and Under-
wald, executed by General Pfiffer on a large fcale.
He has completed about 60 fquare leagues j the plan
is 12 fact long, and nine and a half broad : every
mountain is accurately meafured; and every objeft
diftin&ly placed.
The lake of Lucerne exhibits greater variety and
more pi&urefque fcenery than any other of the Swifs
lakes. It is feven leagues long in a right line, and
three wide about Kuffhacht ; but the lhape is very ir¬
regular. The whole fouth fide is bordered by high
mountains} but the north exhibits hills of no great
height. The narrow gulf that extends towards the
weft, is bordered on the weft and north weft by Mount
Pilat, wdftch is a fingle mountain rifing boldly more
than 6000 feet above the lake ; and on the fouth by
Mount BurgenLerg. Stanz Stadt, belonging to the
canton of Underwald, is on this fide ; and hereabouts
the lake is dtepeft. Kuffnacht is on the point of the
other gulf, w'hicli extends towards the eaft, and is
jvider than the former. All the country to the wreft

of thefe gulfs, and part of it to the north of the
latter, belongs to the canton of Lucerne j but that
which is to the louth and north-eaft is dependant on the
canton of Zug. All the mountains on the left ftiore of
the lake belong to the canton of Underwald ; thofe on
the right, partly to the canton of Uri, partly to that
of Schweitz, partly to the little republic of Gerfaw,
but principally to the canton of Lucerne.

It was firft fettled by the French in 1650; but was
reduced by the Englilh in 1664, w’ho evacuated it in
1666. The French immediately refettled the illand,
but were again driven away by the Caribbs. As foon
as the favages were gone, the former inhabitants re¬
turned, but only for a fhort time ; for being afraid of
falling a prey to the firft privateer that (hould vifit
their coafts, they removed either to other French fet-
tlements that were rtronger, or which they might ex-
peift to be better defended, There was then no re¬
gular culture or colony at St Lucia j it was only fre¬
quented by the inhabitants of Martinico, who came
thither to cut wood, and to build canoes, and who
had confiderable docks on the illand. In 1718 it
W'as again fettled by the French ; but four years af¬
ter, it was given by the court of London to the duke
of Montague, who was fent to take pofleftion of it.
T his occalioned fome difturbance between the tw7o
courts $ which was fettled, however, by an agreement
made in 1731, that, till the refpeftive claims flrould
be finally adjufted, the illand fhould be evacuated by
both nations, but that both Ihould wood and water
there. This precarious agreement furnilhed an op¬
portunity for private intereft to exert itfelf. The
Englilh no longer molefted the French in their habi¬
tations $ but employed them as their afliftants in car-
rying on with richer colonies a fmuggling trade, which
the fubje6ts of both governments thought equally ad¬
vantageous to them. This trade has been more or
lefs confiderable till the treaty of 1763, when the
property of St Lucia w7as fecured to the crown of
France. After that time the colony fiourilhed consi¬
derably. In the beginning of the year 1772, the
number of white people amounted to 2018 fouls, men,
women, and children j that of the blacks to 663 free
men, and 12,795 Haves. The cattle confifted of 928
mules or horfes, 2070 head of horned cattle, and 3184
flieep or goats. There were 38 fugar plantations,
which occupied 978 pieces of land 5 5,595,889 coffee-
trees j 1,321,600 cocoa plants 5 and 367 plots of cot¬
ton. There were 706 dwelling places. The annual
revenue at that time was about 175,000!. which, ac¬
cording to the Abbd Raynal, muff have increafed one-
eighth yearly for fome rime. It was taken by the
Britilh in 17785 reftored to France in 1783. It fell
again into the hands of the Britifti in 1794, was evacu¬
ated m 1795, anft was again retaken in 1796.

LUCIAN, a celebrated Greek author in the firft
century, was born at Samofata, of obfcure parents, in
the reign of the emperor Trajan. He ftudied law, and
pradliled fome time as an advocate} but growing weary
of the wrangling oratory of the bar, he commenced
rhetorician. He lived to the time of Marcus Aure¬
lius, wTho made him regifter of Alexandria in Egypt j
and, according to Suidas, he was at laft worried by
dogs. Lucian was one of the fineft wnts in all anti¬
quity. His Dialogues, and other works, are written
in Greek. In thefe he has joined the ufeful to the
agreeable, inftru&ion to fatire, and erudition to ele¬
gance $ and we everywhere meet with that fine and
delicate raillery which charafterizes the Attic tafte.—
Thofe who cenfure him as an impious fcofter at reli¬
gion, have reafon on their fide, if religion confifted in
the theology of the Pagan poets, or in the extravagant?
opinions of philofophers •, for he perpetually throws
fuch ridicule on the gods and philofophers, with their
vices, as infpires hatred and contempt for them ; but
it cannot be faid that he writes anywhere againft an
overruling providence.
LUC I AN I STS, or Lucanists, a religious fe£l:,
fo called from Lucianus, or Lucanus, a heretic of the
fecond century, being a difciple of Marcion, whofe
errors he followed, adding fome new ones to them. Epi-
phanius fays he abandoned Marcion ; teaching that
people ought not to marry, for fear of enriching the
Creator : and yet other authors mention that he held
this error in common with Marcion and other Gno-
ftics. He denied the immortality of the foul; affert-
ing it to be material.
I here was another fe6t of Lucianifts, wfbo appear¬
ed fome time after the Arians. They taught, that the
Father had been a father always, and that he had the
name even before he begot the Son ; as having in him
the power or faculty of generation ; and in this mar.jer
they accounted for the eternity of the Son.

of fatire to him ; but M. Dacier has maintained, with
great probability, that Lucilius only gave a better
turn t® that kind of poetry, and wrote it with more
wdt and humour than his predeceflbrs Ennius and Pa-

L UC [ 25
of trie moft celebrated of the Latin poets, was born of
an ancient and noble Roinan family, and ftudied at
Athens, where he became one of Epicurus’s lecf. He
acquired great reputation by his learning and elo¬
quence 5 but in the flower of his age fell into a frenzy,
occafloned by a philtre given him by his wife, who
was diftradledly fond of him. Lucretius, daiing the
intervals of his madnefs, put Epicurus’s doctrines into
verfe, and compofed liis fix books De Rerum No turn,
which are full extant. It is faid that he killed him-
felf in a fit of madnefs, in the 54th year before the
Chriftian era, when 51 years old. The molt corredt
edition of Lucretius is that of Simon de Coline. The
cardinal de Polignac has refuted Lucretius’s arguments,
in his excellent Latin poem entitled Anti-Lucre tins.
His poem De Rerum Natura has been tranflated into
Engliih by Mr Creech.
LUCRINUS lacus, in Ancient Geography, a lake
of Campania, between Baige and Puteoli, famous for
its oyiters (Horace, Martial, Juvenal) •, Lucnnenfes
(Cicero), the people dwelling on it. Now a perfect
bay fince the earthquake in 1538.
LUCULLUS, Lucius Lucinius, a Roman gene¬
ral celebrated for his eloquence, his victories, and his
riches. In his youth he made a figure at the bar •, and
being afterwards made quaeflor in Alia, and praetor in
Africa, governed thofe provinces with great modera¬
tion and juftice. Scarce was he known as a military
man, when he twice beat the fleet of Hamilcar, and
gained trvo great vi£lories over him. His happy ge-
Hus was greatly improved by ftudy j for he employed
his leifure in reading the bell authors on military af¬
fairs. Being made conful with Aurelius Cotta, dur¬
ing the third war with Mithridates king of Pontus,
he was fent againft this prince : and this expedition
was attended wJth a feries of vidlories, which did him
lefs honour than an aft of generofity towards his col¬
league j who, walling to take advantage of his abfence
to fignalize himfelf by fome great exploit, hailened to
fight Mithridates •, but was defeated and fliut up in
Chalcedonia; where he mull have perilhed, if Lucullus,
facrificing his refentment to the pleafure of faving a
Roman citizen, had not flown to his affiftance, and
difengaged him. All Pontus then fubmitted to Lu¬
cullus ; who being continued in his government of
Afia, entered the territories of Tigranes, the moll
powerful king in Afia. That prince marched with a
formidable army againfl Lpcullus: who defeated him
with a handful of men, and killed great numbers of
bis forces} took Tigranocertes, the capital of his king¬
dom j and was ready to put an end to the wTar, when
the intrigues of a tribune got him depofed, and Pompey
nominated in his room. Lucullus having brought home
prodigious riches, now gave himfelf up to exceffive lux¬
ury ; and his table was ferved with a profufion till
that time unknorvn. He brought from the Eaft a great
number of books, which he formed into a library,
and gave admittance to all men of learning, wdio fre¬
quented it in great numbers. Toward the end of his
life, he fell into a kind of madnefs j and Lucullus, his
brother was appointed his guardian. He is faid to
have been the firft who brought cherries into Europe,.
having brought the grafts from the kingdom of Pon¬
tus.

LCD, a Britifh king mentioned in our old chro¬
nicles, and faid to have reigned about the year of the
wmrld 3878. He is reported to have enlarged and wall¬
ed about Troynovant, or New Troy, where he kept his
court, and made it his capital. The name of London
is hence derived from Lad's town ; and Ludgate from
his being buried near it : but this is only one among
many other derivations of the name of London ; which
are at leaft equally probable. See London.
LUDAMAR, a Moorifh kingdom in the interior
part of Africa, the capital of which is fituated in N.
Lat. 15. o. W. Long. 60 50. which Mr Park con-
fiders as little fuperior to a deiert. The Moors of Lu-
damar fubfift chiefly on the flefli of their cattle.
The barrennefs of the country is fuch, that it fur-
niflies few materials for manufadlure : but the inhabi¬
tants contrive to weave a ftrong cloth, with which their
tents are covered \ the thread is fpun by the women
from goats hair, and with the hides of their cattle they
furnilh faddles, bridles, pouches, and other articles of
leather. They can alfo convert the native iron pro¬
cured from the negroes into fpears, knives, and pots for
boiling their food ; but they purchafe their fire-arms
and other w eapons of a fimilar nature from the Euro¬
peans, in exchange for Haves.
Their ideas of female perfection are truly Angular,
fince a w'oman, to have the fmalleft pretenfions to
beauty, mull be one who requires a Have under each
arm to fupport her as Ihe wTalks •, and a perfect beauty,
according to Mr Park, is a load for a camel.
The wealth of the Moors chiefly confiits in their
numerous herds of cattle, yet the majority of the people
fpend their days in a Bate of idlenefs. The tent of the
king is the common place of rendezvous for the indo¬
lent, where they appear to enjoy an unlimited liberty
of fpeech •, yet in the praife of their foverdgn they are
wholly unanimous, finging fongs to his honour, which
never fail to be filled with the groffell adulation. The
king fometimes eats out of the fame bafon with the
driver of his camels, and during the heat of the day re-
pofes himfelf upon the fame bed.
^ Cavalry conllitute the chief military flrength of Lu-
damar, which are w7ell mounted, and are very expert
in attacking by furprife. The horfe of every ibldier is
furnifhed by himfelf, as alfo his military, implements,
confiding of a large fabre, a double-barrelled gun, a
red leather bag for holding his balls, and a powder*
horn flung over his (boulder. He has no pay, and his
only compenfation arifes from plunder.
They have no intercourfe with civilized nations, yet
they boafl: an advantage over the negroes, as they pof-
fefs, though in a very limited degree, the knowledge
of letters. They are efleemed the vaineft, proudell,
and moft bigotted, ferocious, and intolerant of all the
nations of the earth, blending in their character the
blind fuperftition of the negro with the favage cruelty
and treachery of the Arab. It W'as with the utmoit
difficulty that Mr Park made his efcape from this cruel
and inhofpitable people.

LUDIUS, a celebrated painter, lived in the reign
of Auguilus Csefar, and excelled in grand compofitions.
He was the firft who painted the fronts of houfes in
the ilreets of Rome j which he beautified with great

LUDLOW, Edmund, fon of Sir Henry Ludlow,
was born at Maidenhead, and educated in Trinity
college, Oxford. His father oppofing the king’s in-
tereft, Mr Ludlow joined with the fame party, and
was prefent at the battle of Edgehill as a volunteer un¬
der the earl of Elfex. Upon the death of his father,
he was chofen knight of the {hire for Wilts, and ob¬
tained the command of a regiment of horfe for the de¬
fence of that country. He was one of King Charles I.’s
judges : after whofe death he was fent by the parlia¬
ment into Ireland, in quality of lieutenant-general of
the horfe; which employment he difcharged with di¬
ligence and fuccefs till the death of the lord-deputy
Ireton, when he afted for fome time as general, though
without that title 5 Cromwell, who knew him to be
fincerely in the interefl of the commonwealth, always
finding out fome pretext to hinder the conferring of
that charadfer upon him. The laft ftroke had been
given by Ludlow to the Irifh rebellion, if the ufurpa-
tion of Cromwell had not prevented it. Under his
power he never adled ; and though Cromwell ufed his
utmoft efforts, he remained inflexible. After Crom-
well’s death, he endeavoured to reftore the common¬
wealth 5 but Charles II. being recalled, he thought
proper to conceal himfelf, and efcaped into Switzer¬
land, where he fettled. After the revolution, he came
over into England, in order to be employed in Ire¬
land againtt King James : but appearing publicly in
London, it gave great offence ; and an addrefs was
prefented by Sir Edward Seymour to King William III.
for a proclamation in order to apprehend Colonel
Ludlowq attainted for the murder of King Charles I.
Upon this he returned to Switzerland, where he
died. During his retirement in Switzerland he wurote
his Memoirs.
Ludlow, a town of Shropfhire in England, fitua-
ted at the conflux of the Teme and Corve, 18 miles
from Shrewfbury, and 138 from London. The pre-
iident of the council of the marches, eifabli tiled by
Henry VIII. generally kept his courts in it, by which
the town was much benefited, thefe courts not having
been abolifhed till the iff of William and Mary. Its
neighbourhood to Wales makes it a great thorough¬
fare, and engages many of the Welfh to lend their
children of both fexes to it for education. It was in¬
corporated by Edward IV. and among other privi¬
leges has that of trying and executing criminals within
itfelf. It is one of the neateft towns in England,
with w7alls and feven gates. It is divided into four
wards \ and is governed by 2 bailiffs, 1 2 aldermen, 25
common-councilmen, a recorder, a town-clerk, fteward,
chamberlain, coroner, &c. From the caftle on the top

is faid to have written the firft part of Ludolph
Hudibras. Of this caftle, which was befieged and ta-
ken by King Stephen, fome of the offices are fallen
down, and great part of it turned into a bowling-green j
but part of the royal apartments and the fword of
ftate are ftill left. The walls were at firft a mile in
compafs, and there was a lawn before it for near two
miles, of which much is now enclofed. The battle¬
ments are very high and thick, and adorned with
towers. It has a neat chapel, where are the coats of
arms of abundance of Wellh gentry, and over the
ftable-doors are the arms of Queen Elizabeth, the earls
of Pembroke, Sec. This caftle was a palace of the
prince of Wales, in right of his principality. The
river Teme has a good bridge over it, feveral wears a-
crofs it, and turns a great many mills. Here is a
large parochial church, which was formerly collegiate ;
in the choir whereof is an infcription relating to Prince
Arthur, elder brother to King Henry VIII. who died
here, and whofe bowels were here depofited, though
it is faid his heart was taken up fome time ago in a
leaden box. In this choir is a clofet, commonly call¬
ed God's Houfe, where the priefts ufed to keep their
confecrated utenfils ; and in the market-place is a con¬
duit, with a long ftone crofs on it, and a niche wherein
is the image of St Laurence, to whom the church was
dedicated. On the north fide of the town there was a
rich priory, whereof there are few’ ruins to be feen ex¬
cept thofe of its church. Here are an alms-houfe for
30 poor people, and two charity-fchools where 50 boys
and 30 girls are both taught and clothed. It has a
market on Monday, and three leffer ones on WTednef-
day, Friday, and Saturday. Its fairs are on the Tuef-
day Eafter, Whit-Wednefday, Auguft 21. Sept. 28.
and Dec. 8. Provifions are very cheap here ; and at
the annual horfe races there is the bell; of company.
The country round is exceedingly pleafant, fruitful, and
populous, efpecially that part called the Corvefdale, be¬
ing the vale on the banks of the river Corve. Ludlow
fends two members to parliament.
LUDOLPH, Job, a very learned writer of the
17th century, was born at Erfurt in Thuringia. He
travelled much, and was mafter of 25 languages, vi-
fited libraries, fearched after natural curiofities and an¬
tiquities everywhere, and converfed with learned men
of all nations. He published a Hiftory of Ethiopia,
and other curious books.
LuDOLPH, Henry William, nephew of Job above
mentioned, was born at Erfurt in 1655. He came
over to England as fecretary to M. Lenthe, envoy from
the court of Copenhagen to that of London \ and be¬
ing recommended to Prince George of Denmark, was
received as his fecretary. He enjoyed this office for
xome years, until he was incapacitated by a violent dif-
order ; when he was difcharged with a handfome pen-
fion : after he recovered, lie travelled into Mufcovy,
where he was well received by the czar, and where
his knowledge made the Mufcovite priefts fuppofe him
to be a conjurer. On his return to London in 1694,
he was cut for the ftone \ and as foon as his health
would permit, in acknowledgement of the civilities he
had received in Mufcovy, he wrote a grammar of their
language, that the natives might learn their own tongue
in a regular method. He then travelled into the Eaft,

Lunatic, in Law. Under the general term of non
compos mentis (which Sir Edward Coke fays is the moft
legal name), are comprifed not only lunatics, but per-
fons under frenzies, or who lofe their intelledis by dif-
eafe ; thofe that grow deaf, dumb, and blind, not be¬
ing born fo; or fuch, in ftiort, as are judged by the
court of chancery incapable of conducting their own af¬
fairs. To thefe alfo, as well as idiots, the king is guar¬
dian, but to a very different purpofe. For the law al¬
ways imagines, that thefe accidental misfortunes may
be removed j and therefore only conftitutes the crown a
truftee for the unfortunate perfons, to proteCl their pro¬
perty, and to account to them for all profits received,
if they recover, or after their deceafe to their reprefen-.
tativea,

tatives. And therefore it is declared by the ftatute
17 Edw. II. c. 10. that the king (hall provide for the
cuitody and fuftentation of lunatics, and preferve their
lands, and the profits of them, for their ufe when they
come to their right mind 5 and the king (hall take
nothing to his own ufe : and if the parties die in
fuch eftate, the refidue fhall be diftributed for their
fouls by the advice of the ordinary, and of courfe (by
the fubfequent amendments of the law of adminiftra-
tions) (hall now go to their executors or adminiftrators.
On the fiiA attack of lunacy, or other occalional in-
fanity, when there may be hopes of a fpeedy rellitution
of reafon, it is ufual to confine the unhappy objects in
private cuftody under the diredtion of their neareft
friends and relations j and the legiflature, to prevent all
abufes incident to fuch private cudody, hath thought
proper to interpofe its authority, by 1 4 Geo. III. c. 49.
for regulating private mad-houfes. But when the dif-
order is grown permanent, and the circumftances of the
party will bear fuch additional expence, it is thought
proper to apply to the royal authority to warrant a lad¬

fimilar to that of proving him an idiot. The lord
chancellor, to whom, by fpecial authority from the
king, the cuttody of idiots and lunatics is intruded,
upon petition or information, grants a commiflion in
nature of the writ de idiota inquirendo, to inquire into
the party’s date of mind ; and if he be found non com¬
pos, he ufually commits the care of his perfon, wfith a
fuitable allowance for his maintenance, to fome friend,
who is then called his committee. However, to pre¬
vent finifter pradiices, the next heir is feldom permitted
to be of this committee of the perfon ; beeaufe it is his
intered that the party fhould die. But it hath been faid
there lies not the fame objeftion againd his next of kin,
provided he be not his heir •, for it is his intered to pre¬
ferve the lunatic’s life, in order to increafe the perfonal
edate by favings, which he or his family may hereafter
be entitled to enjoy. The heir is generally made the
manager or committee of the eftate, it being clearly his
intered by good management to keep it in condition :
accountable, however, to the court of chancery, and to
the non compos himfelf, if he recovers $ or otherwife, to
his adminidrators. See Idiocy.

LUNDY island, fituated 50 miles in the fea, off
the north-wed coad of Devonfhire, is five miles long
and two broad, but fo encompafied with inacceflible
rocks, that it has but one entrance to it, fo narrow that
two men can fcarcely go abread. It is reckoned in the
hundred of Brandon. It had once both a fort and a
chapel. The fouth part of it is indifferent good foil,
but the north part of it is barren, and has a high pyra¬
midal rock called the Con/lable. Here are horfes, kine,
hogs, and goats, with great dore of dieep and rabbits j
but the chief commodity is fowl, w'ith which it abounds
much, their eggs being very thick on the ground at

their feafon of breeding. No venomous creature will
live in this ifiand. In the reign of Henry VIII. one

LUNE, Lunula, in Geometry, a plane in form of

LUNENBURG, or Lunenburg Zell, a principa¬
lity of Germany, bounded to the fouth by that of Ca-
lenberg, the diocefe of Hildedieim, and the duchy of
Brunfwic ; to the north, by the duchy of Lauenburg
and the Elbe, by the lad of which it is feparated from
the territory of the imperial city of Hamburgh ; to the
cad, by the duchy of Brunfwic, the Alte Mark, and
the duchy of Mecklenburg •, and to the wed, by the
duchies of Bremen and Verden, the county of Hoya,
and the principality of Calenberg. The foil, except
along the Elbe, Aller, and Jetz, is either fand, heath,
or moor. In the more fruitful parts of it are produced
wheat, rye, barley, oats, peafe, buck-wheat, flax, hemp,
hops, pulfe, oak, beech, firs, pines, birch, and alder,
together with black cattle and horfes. The heaths
abound with bees and honey, and a fmall kind of ftieep
whofe wool is long and coarfe. Lunenburg is well fur-
nhhed wdth fait fprings and limeftone, and the foreft of
Gorde with venifon. The rivers Elbe, Umenau and
Aller, are navigable; and confequently very advanta¬
geous to the country, independent of the fifli which
they yield. The general diets of this principality are
convened by the fovereign twice a-year, and held at
Zell. They confift of the deputies of the nobility and
the towns of Lunenburg, Uelzen, and Zell, who have
the nomination of the members of the high colleges, and
other officers, jointly with the fovereign. There are
near 200 Lutheran churches in the country, under two
general and 15 fubordinate fuperintsndants, feveral
grammar-fchools, two Calvinift churches at Zell, and
an academy of exercifes at Lunenburg. The manufac¬
tures are chiefly linen cloth, cottons, ribbons, ftockings,
hats, ftarch, bleached wax, refined fugar, gold and
filver wires, all kinds of wooden wares, barges, boats,
and {hips. The exports of thefe to Hamburgh, Lubec,
and Altona, are confiderable. The neighbourhood of
thefe cities, with the facility of conveying goods and
merchandife to them and other places, either by land
or water, is very advantageous to this country, and
contributes greatly to its fubfiftence. On account of
this principality, the king of Great Britain has a feat
ancl voice both in the college of the princes of the em¬
pire and of the circle of LowTer Saxony. Its quota in
the mfitricula is 20 horfe and 120 foot, or 7 20 florins
in lieu of them. The revenues of the principality arife
chiefly from the demefnes, tolls on the Elbe, contribu¬
tions, duties on cattle, beer, wine, brandy, and other
commodities, which all together muff be very confider¬
able, fome bailiwics alone yielding upwards of 20,coo
rix-dollars.
Lunenburg, the capital of the principality of the
fame name, is a pretty large town of Germany, on the
river Elmen, or the Umenau, wffiich is navigable from

v ' ]pormeriy this town was one of the Hanfc, and an im¬
perial city. Some derive its name from Lina, the
ancient name of the llmenau others from Luna, the
moon, an image of which is faid to have been wor-
fhipped by the inhabitants in the times of Paganilm.
Here were anciently feveral convents, viz. one of Mi¬
nims, another of Premonftratenfians, another of Be-
nediftines, and a fourth of Minorites. Gut of the
revenues of the Benedictine monaftery was founded an
academy for the martial exercifes, where young gentle¬
men of the principality of Lunenburg are maintained
gratis, and taught French, fencing, riding, and dan¬
cing \ but foreigners are educated at a certain fixed
price. A Latin fchool was alfo founded, confifting of
four claffes, and wTell endowed out of thefe revenues.
The fuperintendancy and management of thefe, and the
eftates appropriated to their maintenance, belongs to
the landfchaft dire&or, and the aufreiter, who are both
chofen from among the Lunenburg nobility. The firft
came in place of the Popifh abbot, and as fuch is head
of the ftates of the principality, and prefident of the
provincial college. He has the title of excellency ; and
in public inftruments ftyles himfelf, by the grace of God
landfchaft direBor, and lord of the manfon of St Michael
in Lunenburg. The chief public edifices are three pa-
rilh-churches, the ducal palace, three hofpitals, the
town-houfe, the falt-magazine, the anatomical theatre,
the academy ; the conventual church of St Michael, in
which lie interred the ancient dukes, and in which is
the famous table eight feet long, and four wide, plated
over with chafed gold, with a rim embellifhed with
precious ftones, of an immenfe value, which was taken
from the Saracens by the emperor Otho, and prefented
to this church : but in 1698, a gang of thieves dripped
it of 200 rubies and emeralds, together with a large
diamond, and moft of the gold, fo that at prefent but a
fmall part of it remains. Here are fome very rich fait
fprings. Formerly, when there was a greater demand
for the fait, upwards of 120,000 tons have been an¬
nually boiled here, and fold off; but fince the com¬
mencement of the prefent century, the fait trade hath
declined greatly. A fifth of the fait made here belongs
to the king, but is farmed out. It is faid to excel all
the other fait made in Germany. This town is wrell
fortified 5 and has a garrifon, which is lodged in bar¬
racks. In the neighbourhoood is a good limedone
quarry •, and along the llmenau are warehoufes, in
which are lodged goods brought from all parts of Ger¬
many, to be forwarded by the llmenau to Hamburgh,
or by the Afche to Lubec, from whence other goods
are brought back the fame w’ay. The towm itfelf carries
on a confiderable traffic in wax, honey, wool, fiax, linen,
fait, lime, and beer.

now known among us by the name of the Carrara
marble, and didinguidxed from the datuary kind by its
greater hardnefs and lefs fplendour. It w7as ever great¬
ly edeemed in building and ornamental works, and is
fo dill. It is of a very clofe and fine texture, of a very
pure white, and much more tranfparent than any
other of the white marbles. It has^ always been found Lunette,
in great quantities in Italy, and is fo to this day. See ^imSs’ ,

LUNGS, in Anatomy, a part of the human body,
ferving for refpiration. See Anatomy, N° 117.
In the Journal dc Medicine for June 1789 is a de-
feription of an
Injlrument for Inflating the Lungs, invented by M.
Gorcy, phyfician to the military hofpital at Neufbrifack,
which appears to be extremely w'ell adapted to the pur¬
pofe,-whild it may be ufed with the greated eale and
facility.
This indrument, which the inventor dyles apodopic,
that is, “ redorer of refpiration,” confids of a double piatfi
pair of bellows, BCLM, fig. 1. the two different parts CCXCVilft
of which have no communication with each other. In
the low’er fide BM, is an aperture A for a valve con-
drufted on the principles of thofe of Mr Nairne’s air-
pump. It condds of a rim of copper, clofed at one
end by a plate of the fame metal, in which plate are fe-
ven fmall holes placed at equal didances. This plate is
covered with pieces of dlk coated with eladic gum, in
which are fix tranfverfe incifions of two or three lines in
length. Each incifion is fo made as to be fituated be¬
tween two of the holes, and at au equal didance from
each : flee D, fig. 2. The filk mud be made very fe-
cure, by a thread palfing feveral times round the rim.
It is obvious, that a dream of air applied to that dde of
the plate which is oppofite the filk, will pafs through
the holes, and, lifting up the filk, efcape through the
incifions. On the contrary, a dream of air applied to
the other fide will prefs the filk upon the plate, and thus
clofe the holes, fo that it will be impollible for it to
pais through them. This valve opens internally, fo as
to admit the air from without. At B is another valve, on
the fame condruflion, but opening in a contrary direc¬
tion, thus permitting the air to efcape out of the lower
part into the tube EF, but preventing its entrance. At
C is another valve, opening internally to admit the air
from the tube EF j and at D there is a fourth, opening
externally to difeharge the air from the upper part.
The flexible tube EF, ferewed on at the end CB,„
being introduced into one of the nodrils, whild the
mouth and the other nodril are clofed by an aflidant,
if we feparate the two handles LM, which were clofe
together at the introduction of the tube, it is evident,
that the air in the lungs will rufh into the upper part
through the valve C, whild the external air will fill
the lower part through the valve A : the two handles
being
L U P [ 264 ] L U S
being again brought into contaft, the atmofpheric air ing under the 3 2d order, Pabilionacece.
will be forced into the lungs through the valve B, and
at the fame time the air in the upper part will be dif-
charged at the valve D. Thus by the alternate play of
the double bellows, the lungs wTill be alternately filled
and emptied as in refpiration. In ufing the inftrument
care Ihould be taken not to be too violent j as the more
perfetlly the natural motion of refpiration is imitated,
the better.
To prevent any fubflances from without injuring the
valves AD, fig. x. the rim is made with a fcrew% B, fig. 3.
in order to receive a cap AA, fig. 3. full of fmall holes.
Ibis fcrew has alfo another ufe. If air or oxygen
gas be preferred, a bladder filled with it, fig. 4. may,
by means of the fcrew A, be faftened to the valve A,
fig. 1. ; and, to prevent wafte, as this air may ferve fe-
veral times, a flexible tube maybe fcrewed on the valve
D, fig. 1. communicating with the bladder by means of
the opening </, fig. 4.: thus it may be employed as of¬
ten as the operator thinks proper.
There is a handle K to the partition in the middle,
in order that, if it be at any time necelfary to ufe either
of the divifions alone, the other may be confined from
afling. c, b, fig. 5. reprefent the two valves to be ap¬
plied at the end of the inftrument C, B, fig. 1. ; and
fig. 6. is a fedflion of the end CB, fhowing the valves in
their proper places.
It is proper to add, that the capacity of the inftru¬
ment ftiould be proportioned to the quantity of air re¬
ceived into the lungs in infpiration, which Dr Goodwyn
has afcertained to be twelve cubical inches or fomewhat
more. Each divifion of the inftrument, therefore,
fhould be capable of containing that quantity.

LUPERCALIA, feafts inftituted in ancient Rome,
in honour of the god Pan. The wrord comes from Lu-
percal, the name of a place under the Palatine moun¬
tain, where the facrifices wTere performed.
The Lupercalia were celebrated on the T5th of the
kalends of March, that is, on the 15th of February, or,
as Ovid obferves, on the third day after the ides. They
are fuppofed to have been eftabliftied by Evander.
On the morning of this feaft, the Luperci, or priefts
of Pan, ran naked through the ftreets of Rome, ftrik-
ing the married women they met on the hands and
belly with a thon<? or ftrap of goats leather, which was
held an omen promifing them fecundity and happy de¬
liveries. See Luperci.

but afterwards reftored, and continued to the time of
•the emperor Anaftafius—Earonius fays it was aboliftted
by the pope in 496.

LUSATIA, a marquifate of Germany, in Upper
Saxony; bounded to the eaft by Silefia, to the w^elt by
Mifiiia, to the fouth by Bohemia, and to the north by
the marquifate of Brandenburgh. Till towards the
middle of the 13th century, the Upper Lufatia was
called the Mark, i. e. the marquifate or the land of Bu-
difzin and Gorlitz ; and the Lower only Lufatia, which
it is faid, in the Sclavonic, Signifies “ a woody or
marlhy country.” The air of the Upper Lufatia,
which is hilly or mountainous, is better than that of
the Lower, a great part of which is moorilh and bog¬
gy. Both abound in wood, efpecially the Lower, and
turf for fuel. The heathy and mountainous trafts are
generally barren 5 but the lower champaign and marlh
lands are tolerably fertile, producing pafture, wheat,
rye, oats, barley, buck-wheat, peafe, lentils, beans,
and millet 5 together with flax, hops, tobacco, fome
white and red wine, and what is called manna. Of
feveral of thefe articles, however, confiderable quan¬
tities are imported. In this country are found alfo
quarries of ftone, medicinal fprings, baftard diamonds,
agates, and jafpers, earths and clays for tobacco-
pipes and all forts of earthen ware, alum, good iron
ftone, vitriolic and copper water 5 nor is it deftitute
of cattle, fifti, and venifon. The rivers Spree, the
Schwarze or Black Elfter, and the Pulznitz, have

Lufatiii. their fources in the Lufatias, which are alro watered
—■"V—by the Neiffe and Queis. The ancient inhabitants of
this country were the Saxons, who were fucceeded by
the Vandals, and thefe by the Sober-Wends, a Scla-
vonian people. The prefent inhabitants, the defcen-
dants of the Wends, have an odd drefs ; and the lan¬
guage is fo inarticulate and guttural, that it hath been
(laid, it might be pronounced without lips, teeth, or
tongue ; but the towns are almoft wholly peopled by
Germans.
In the Upper Lufatia are fix towns which appear
at the land-diets, 16 fmaljer country towms, and four
market towns. In the Lower are four diet towns, 1 3
country towns, and two market ones. Both marqui-
fates were formerly fubjeft either to the kings of Bo¬
hemia, the archdukes of Auftria, or eleftors of Bran-
denburgh •, but, in 1636, both were abfolutely ceded
to the eledtor of Saxony, in lieu of the 72 tons of
gold which he expended in afiifting the emperor Fer¬
dinand II. again!! the Bohemians.
Chriftianity was firft planted in Lufatia in the fe-
venth century ; but it was feveral centuries after that
before Popery was fully eftablifired. In the nth Cen¬
tury many cloiflers were eredled in the country; but
at the Reformation fuch numbers embraced Lutheran-
ifni, that it became the predominant religion, and ftill
continues, though there are liill feveral Roman Ca¬
tholic foundations, churches, market-towns, and vil¬
lages. The enthufiaftic fed! of Hernhuters pofTefies
a great influence and efleem here. There are con-
fiderable manufadlures of woollen and linen fluffs in
the Lufatias, efpecially the Upper. At Budiifen, and
in the adjacent country, prodigious quantities of dock¬
ings, fpatterdafhes, caps, and gloves are made. The
linen manufadlures alfo flourifh here, chiefly in the Up¬
per Lufatia, where all forts of linen are made, print¬
ed, and dyed. Exclufive of thefe, there are confider-
able manufadlures of hats, leather, paper, gunpowder,
iron, glafs, bleached wax, &c. Though the demand
and exportation of thefe commodities, particularly li¬
nens and woollens, is not fo great as formerly, yet it
is ft ill confiderable, and more than overbalances their
importations in wool, yarn, filk, wines, fpices, corn,
frefh and baked fruits, garden fluff, and hops. Dif-
putes of many years Handing have fubfifled between
the country artificers and linen manufadlurers on the
one fide, and the diet towns on the other •, the latter
unjuftly feeking to exclude the former from any fhare
in the linen trade. The natives of this country are faid
to have quick natural parts, but to be fordidly penu¬
rious. We are told they obferve the Saxon laws much
better than they did the Bohemian. Learning hath
been much efteemed and encouraged in both marqui-
fates fince the Reformation. The fchools in the fix
diet towns of Upper Lufatia, particularly at Gorlitz,
Budiffen, and Zittau, greatly diflinguifh themfelves,
having handfome flipends. In Lower Lufatia alfo are
fome good fchools, with flipends for the maintenance
of Hudents. Printing is faid to be much folkwed,
and brought to great perfedlion in this country.
In Upper Lufatia, the flates confift, ifl, of thofe
called 2dly, of the prelates-, 3dly, of the
gentry and commonalty, under which are comprehend¬
ed the counts, barons, nobles, and burgeffes, poffef-
fors of fe*=s and fief-effates} and, 4thly, of the repre-

fentatives of the fix principal towns. Without the Lufatia
confent of thefe flates no taxes can be impofed, nor any ^ | (
thing of importance, that regards the public, tranf-, ""
acled. The diets are ordinary or extraordinary. The
ordinary meet once in three years, and the extraordi¬
nary when fummoned by the fovereign upon particular
emergencies. As to ecclefiaftical matters, the dean of
Budiffen and his confiflory exercife all manner of epif-
copal jurifdidlion ; and among the Proteflants, the
jurifdiblion belongs either to the fuperior, the upper-
office, or the patrons. The revenues arifing to the
fuperior or fovereign, from Upper Lufatia, confifl
partly of the fubfidies granted by the flates, among
which, at prefent, are reckoned capitation and eftate-
money ; and partly of the beer-tax, excife, tolls, &c.
—Upper Lufatia is divided into two great circles, viz.
thofe of Budiffen and Gorlitz, which are again divided
into leffer circles.
The land Hates of Lower Lufatia confift:, like thofe
of the Upper, of prelates, lords, and knights, and
the repre'entatives of the flate towns, which are Luc-
kau, Gubben-Lubben, and Kalau. Two land diets
are yearly held at Lubben, called voluntary-diets; but
wrhen the fuperior caufes the Hates to be fummoned
together at his diferetion, and propofitions to be laid
before them, by commiffaries deputed for that pur-
pofe, fuch convention is called a great land diet. The
marquifate is divided into five circles, each of which
holds a circle aflembly in its circle town. The chief
officers appointed either by the fuperior or the Hates
are, the prefident of the upper office, the land captain,
and the land judge. The principal tribunals are, the
land court, and the upper office, to which lie appeals
from the inferior judicatories. There are alfo officers
for the feveral circles. Spiritual matters belong here
to a confiflory, erefled in 1668. The ordinary taxes
are paid into the chefl of the circle j and from thence
configned to the general cheft, of which the upper
tax-receiver is fuperintendant. By him an annual ac¬
count of the receipts is made out, which is examined
and pafled by the deputies of the Hates.

Lvstral Day (Dies Lujiricus), that whereon the
luflrations were performed for a child, and its name
given; which was dually the ninth day from the birth
of a boy, and the eighth from that of girl. Though
others performed the ceremony on the lall day of that
week wherein the child was born, and others on the
fifth day from its birth.
Over this feaft-day the goddefs Nundina was fup-
pofed to prefide ; the midwives, nurfes, and domeflics
handed the child backwards and forwards, around a
fire burning on the altars of the gods, a^ter which they
fprinkled it with water ; hence this feaft had the name
LI of

of atnpJudromia. The old women mixed fall vs and dull
with the water. The whole ended with a fumptuous
entertainment. The parents received gifts from their
friends on this occaiion. If the child was a male, their
door was decked with an olive garland j if a female,
with wool, denoting the work about which women
w7ere to be employed.
LUSTRATION, in Antiquitij, facrinces or cere¬
monies by which the ancUnts purified their cities,
fields, armies, or people, defiled by any crime or im¬
purity. Some of thefe luftrations wrere public, others
private. There were three fpecies or manners of per¬
forming luftration, viz. by fire and fulphur, by water,
and by air 5 which laid was done by fanning and agi¬
tating the air round the thing to be purified. Some
of thefe luftrations were neceffary, i. e. could not be
difpenfed with ; as luftrations of houfes in time of a
plague, or upon the death of any perfon : others again
were done out of choice, and at pleafure. The public
luftrations at Rome were celebrated every fifth year j
in which they led a viflim thrice round the place to
be purified, and in the mean time burnt a great quan¬
tity of perfumes. Their country luftrations, which
they called ambarvalia, w7ere celebrated before they
began to reap their com: in thofe of the armies, which
they called armilujlria, icme chofen ioldiers, crowned
with laurel, led the victims, which were a cow, a ftieep,
and a bull, thrice round the army ranged in battle-
array in the field of Mars, to which deity the viftims
u7ere afterwards faciificed, after pouring out many
imprecations upon the enemies of the Romans. The
luftrations of their flocks were performed in this man¬
ner: the fliepheid fprinkled them with pure water,
and thrice furreunded his flieepfold with a compofition
of favin, laurel, and brimftone fet on fire ; and after-
w7ards facrificed to the goddefs Pales an offering of
milk boiled, wine, a cake, and millet. As for private
houfes, they were luftrated with water, a fumigation
of laurel, juniper, olive tree, favin, and fuch like *, and
the viclim commonly w7as a pig. Luftrations made
for particular perfons were commonly called expiations,
and the vidtims piacula. There was alfo a kind of
luftration ufed for infants, by which they were purified,
girls the third, and boys the ninth, day after their
birth 5 which ceremony was performed with pure water
and fpittle. See the article Ambarvalia.—In their
luftratory facrifices, the Athenians lacrificed two men,
one for the men of their city, and the other for the
women. Divers of thefe expiations were auftere : fome
failed ; others abftained from all fenfual pleafures;
ar.d fome, as the priefts of Cybele, caftrated them-
felves. The poftures of the penitents were different
according to the different facrifices. The priefts
changed their habits according to the ceremony to be
performed ; white, purple, and black, were the moft
ufual colours. They call into the river, or at leaft out
cf the city, the animals or other things that had ferved
for a luftration or facrifice of atonement ; and thought
themfelves threatened with fome great misfortune when
by chance they trod upon them. Part of thefe cere¬
monies wTere aboliflied by the emperor Conftantine and
his fucceffors .* the reft fubfifted till the Gothic kings

L U T l
LUTETIA PARISIORUM, in ^rtcienl Geography, a
town of the Panfix, in Gallia Celtica, fituated in an
ifiand in the Setjuana or Seine. It received its name,
as fome fuppofe, from the quantity of clay, lututn, which
is in its neighbourhood. J. Caefar fortified and embel-
lillied it. from which circumftance fome authors call it
pfulii Chit as. Julian the apoftate relided there for
lome time. It is nowf Pjris, the capital of France j
fo called from its name Paryis in the lower age.
LUTHER, Martin, the celebrated author of the
Reformation, w’as a native of Eifleben m Saxony, and
born in 1483. Though his parents were poor, he re-,
ceived a learned education ; during the progrefs oi
which, he gave many indications of uncommon vigour
and acutenefs of genius. As his mind was naturally
fufceptible of ferious impreffions, and tin&ured with
fomew’hat of that religious melancholy which delights
in the folitude and devotion of a monaftic life, he re¬
tired into a convent of Auguflinian friars j where he
acquired great reputation, not only for piety, but for
love of knowdedge and unwearied application to ftudy.
The caufe of this retirement is faid to have been, that
he wTas once ftruck by lightning, and his companion
killed by his fide by the fame flalh. Fie had been taught
the fcholaftic philofophy wdiich was in vogue in thofe
days, and made confiderable progrefs in it : but hap¬
pening to find a copy of the Bible which lay negletted
in the library of his monaftery, he applied himfelf to
the ftudy of it with fuch eagernefs and afliduity, as
quite aftoniftied the monks ; and increafed his reputa¬
tion for fanfrity fo much, that he was chofen profef-
for firft of philofophy, and afterwards of theology, at
Wittemberg on the Elbe, where Frederic eledfor of
Saxony had founded an univerfity.
While Luther continued to enjoy the higheft repu¬
tation for fandlity and learning, Tetzel, a Dominican
friar, came to Wittemberg in order to publifti indul¬
gences. Luther beheld his iuccefs wuth great con¬
cern 5 and having firft inveighed againft indulgences
from the pulpit, he afterwards publifhed 95 thefes,
containing his fentiments on that fubjedl. I hefe he
propofed, not as points fully eftablifhed, but as fub-
jecls of inquiry and difputation. He appointed a day
on which the learned were invited to impugn them ei¬
ther in perfon or by writing •, and to the whole he
fubjoined folemn proteftations of his High refpedt for
the apoftolic fee, and of his implicit fubmiflion to its
authority. No opponent appeared at the time pre¬
fixed j the thefes fpread over Germany with aftonifh-
ing rapidity, and were read with the greateft eager-
wefs.
Though Luther met with no oppofition for fome
little time after he began to publifti his new doftrines,
it was not long before many zealous champions arofe
to defend tliofe opinions with which the wealth and
power of the clergy wTere fo ftriclly connecfed. I heir
caufe, hoxvever, was by no means promoted by thefe
endeavours •, the people began to call in queftion even
the authority of the canon law and of the pope him¬
felf.—-The court of Rome at firft defpifed thefe new
doctrines and difputes ; but at laft the attention of
the pope being raifed by the great iuccefs of the re¬
former, and the complaints of his adverfaries, Luther
fummoned in the month of July 1518, to ap-
was

pear at Rome, within 60 days, before the auditor or i Fntaer.
the chamber. One of Luther’s adverfaries, named
Prierias, who had written againft; him, W’as appointed
to examine his doctrines, and to decide concerning
them. The pope wrote at the fame time to the elec¬
tor of Saxony, befeeching him not to prote£b a man
whole heretical and profane tenets wTere fo (hocking to
pious ears j and enjoined the provincial of the Au-
guftinians to check by his authority the raftinefs of an
arrogant monk, which brought difgrace upon their '
order, and gave offence and difturbance to the whole
church.
From thefe letters, and the appointment of his open
enemy Prierias to be his judge, Luther eafily faw
W'hat fentence he might expect at Rome j and there¬
fore difcovered the utmoft folicitude to have his caufe
tried in Germany, and before a lefs fuipefted tri¬
bunal. He wrote a fubmiflive letter to the pope, in
which he promifed an unreferved obedience to his will,
for as yet he entertained no doubt of the divine ori¬
ginal of the pope’s authority j and by the interceftion
of the other profeflbrs, Cajetan the pope’s legate in
Germany was appointed to hear and determine the
caufe. Luther appeared before him wuthout hefita-
tion : but Cajetan thought it below his dignity to
difpute the point with a perfon fo much his inferior
in rank ; and therefore required him by virtue of the
apoftolic powers wdth which he was clothed, to retraft
the errors which he had uttered with regard to indul¬
gences and the nature of faith, and to abftain for the
future from the publication of new and dangerous
opinions ; and at the laft forbade him to appear in his
prefence, unlefs he propofed to comply with what had
been required of him.
This haughty and violent manner of proceeding,
together with fome other circutn(lances, gave Luther’s
friends fuch ftrong reafons to fufpedl that even the
imperial fafe-condu£f would not be able to protect
him from the legate’s power and refentment, that
they prevailed on him fecretly. to withdraw from
Auglburg, where he had attended the legate, and to
return to his own country. But before his departure,
according to a form of which there had been fome
examples, he prepared a folemn appeal from the pope,
ill-informed at that time concerning his caufe., to the
pope, when he ftiould receive more full intimation
with refpefl to it.—Cajetan, enraged at Luther’s
abrupt retreat, and at the publication of his appeal,
wrote to the elector of Saxony, complaining of both ;
and requiring him, as he regarded the peace of the
church, or the authority of its head, either to fend
that feditious monk a prifoner to Rome, or to banifti
him out of his territories. Frederic had hitherto, from
political motives, protefled Luther, as thinking he
might be of ufe in checking the enormous power of
the fee of Rome j and though all Germany refounded
with his fame, the ele&or had never yet admitted
him into his prefence. But upon this demand made
by the cardinal, it became necelfary to throw off
fomewhat of 'his former referve. He had been at
great expence and beftowed much attention on found¬
ing a new univerfity, an obje£t of confiderable import¬
ance to every German prince 5 and fdrefeeing how
fatal a blow7 the removal of Luther w7ould be to its
L 1 2 reputation,
L U T f 268 ] L U T
Luther, reputation, he not only declined complying with either
of the pope’s requefts, but openly difcovered great
concern for Luther’s fafety.
The fituation of our reformer, in the mean time,
became daily more and more alarming. He knew
very well what were the motives which induced the
elector to afford him proteftion, and that he could by
no means depend on a continuance of his frier,dfliip.
If he fhould be obliged to quit Saxony, he had no
other afylum, and muff ftand expofed to whatever
punifhment the rage or bigotry of his enemies could
inflift j and fo ready were his adverfaries to condemn
him, that he had been declared a heretic at Rome
before the expiration of the 60 days allowed him in
the citation for making his appearance. Notwith-
ifanding all this, however, he difcovered no fymptoms
of timidity or remiffnefs 5 but continued to vindicate
his own condudt and opinions, and to inveigh againft
thofe of his adverfaries with more vehemence than
ever. Being convinced, therefore, that the pope w*ould
foon proceed to the molt violent meafures againft
him, he appealed to a general council, which he
affirmed to be the reprefentative of the Catholic church,
and fuperior in powder to the pope, who being a fallible
man, might err, as St Peter, the moft perfedt of his pre-
deceffors, had done.
The court of Rome were equally affiduous in the
mean time to cruffi the author of thefe new dodtrines
which gave them fo much unealinefs. A bull was
ifl'ued by the pope, of a date prior to Luther’s ap¬
peal, in which he magnified the virtues of indulgences,
and fubjedted to the heavieft ecclefiaftical cenfures all
who prefumed to teach a contrary dodtrine. Such a
clear decifion of the fovereign pontiff againft him
might have been very fatal to Luther’s caufe, had not
the death of the emperor Maximilian, which happened
on January 17. 1519, contributed to give matters a
different turn. Both the principles and intereft of
Maximilian had prompted him to fupport the authori¬
ty of the fee of Rome : but, in confequence of his
death, the vicariate of that part of Germany which is
governed by the Saxon laws devolved to the eledtor
of Sa'xony 5 and, under the ffielter of his friendly ad-
miniftration, Luther himfelf enjoyed tranquillity ; and
his opinions took fuch root in different places, that
they could never afterwards be eradicated. At the
fame time, as the eledlion of an emperor was a point
more interefting to the pope (Leo X.) than a theolo¬
gical controverfy which he did not underftand, and of
which he could not forefee the confequences, he was
fo extremely felicitous not to irritate a prince of fuch
confiderable influence in the eledtoral college as Fre¬
derick, that he difcovered a great umvillingnefs to pro¬
nounce the fentence of excommunication againft Lu¬
ther, which his adverfaries continually demanded with
the moft clamorous importunity.
From the reafon jufl now given, and Leo’s natu¬
ral averfion to fevere meafures, a fufpenfion of pro¬
ceeding againft Luther took place for 18 months,
though perpetual negociations were carried on during
this interval in order to bring the matter to an ami¬
cable iffue. The manner in which thefe were con¬
ducted having given our reformer many opportunities
of obferving the corruption of the court of Rome, its
obftinacy in adhering to eftablifhed errors, and its in¬
difference about truth, however clearly propofed or Luther.
ftrongly proved, he began, in 1520, to utter fome ' 
doubts with regard to the divine original of the papal
authority, which he publicly difputed with Eccius,
one of his moft learned and formidable antagonifts.
The difpute wTas indecifive, both parties claiming the
victory ; but it muft have been very mortifying to the
partizans of the Romith church to hear fuch an effen-
tial point of their doCtrine publicly attacked.
The papal authority being once fufpeCted, Luther
proceeded to pulh on his inquiries and attacks from
one doCtrine to another, till at laft he began to ftiake
the firmeft foundations on which the wealth and power
of the church were eftabliftied. Leo then began to
perceive that there were no hopes of reclaiming fuch
an incorrigible heretic 5 and therefore prepared to de¬
nounce the fentence of excommunication againft him.
The college of cardinals wras often affembled, in order
to prepare the fentence with due deliberation ; and the
ableft canonifts were confulted how it might be ex-
preffed with unexceptionable formality. At laft it was
iffued on the 15th of June 1520. Forty-one propoft-
tions, extracted out of Luther’s works, wrere therein
condemned as heretical, fcandalous, and offenfive to
pious ears j all perfons were forbidden to read his writ¬
ings, upon pain of excommunication : fuch as had any
of th em in their cuftody v/ere commanded to commit
them to the flames j he himfelf, if he did not, within
60 days, publicly recant his errors, and burn his books,
was pronounced an obftinate heretic, excommunicated,
and delivered to Satan for the deftruition of the fleffi:
and all lecular princes wrere required, under pain of in¬
curring the fame cenfure, to feize his perfon, that he
might be punifhed as his crimes deferved.
Luther was not in the leaft difconcerted by this fen¬
tence, which he had for fome time expeCted. He re-
newed his appeal to a general council} declared the
pope to be that antichrift, or man @f fin, vffiofe ap¬
pearance is foretold in the New Teftament; declaim¬
ed againft his tyranny with greater vehemence than
ever 5 and at laft, by wray of retaliation, having affem¬
bled all the profeffors and ffudents in the univerfity
of Wittemberg, with great pomp, and in the pre¬
fence of a vaft multitude of fpeCtators, he caft the vo¬
lumes of the canon law, together with the bull of ex-
communication, into the flames. The manner in which
this action w-as juftified gave ftill more offence than
the action itfelf. Having collefted from the canon law
fome of the moft extravagant propofitions with regard
to the plenitude and omnipotence of the pope’s power,
as w^ell as the fubordination of all fecular jurifdiction
to his authority, he publiihed thefe with a commen¬
tary, pointing out the impiety of fuch tenets, and their
evident tendency to fubvert all civil government.
On the acceffion of Charles V. to the empire, Lu¬
ther found himfelf in a very dangerous fituation.
Charles, in order to fecure the pope’s friendfhip, had
determined to treat him with great feverity. His ea-
gernefs to gain this point, rendered him not averfe to
gratify the papal legates in Germany, who infifted, that
without any delay or formal deliberation, the diet then
fitting at Worms ought to condemn a man whom the
pope had already excommunicated as an incorrigible
heretic. Such an abrupt manner of proceeding, howr-
ever; being deemed unprecedented and unjuft by the
members
L U T [ 269 ] L U T
Luther, members of the diet, they made a point of Luther’s
—v appearing in perfon, and declaring whether he adhered
or not to thofe opinions which had drawn upon him
the cenfures of the church. Not only the emperor, but
all the princes through rvhofe territories he had to
pafs, granted him a fafe-conduft ; and Charles wrote
to him at the fame time, requiring his immediate at¬
tendance on the diet, and renewing his promifes of pro-
teftion from any injury or violence. Luther did not
hefitate one moment about yielding obedience ; and
fet out for Worms, attended by the herald who had
brought the emperor’s letter and fafe-conduct. While
on his journey, many of his friends, whom the fate of
Hufs, under fimilar circumftances, and notwithitand-
ing the fame fecurity of an imperial fafe-condudl, fill¬
ed with folicitude, advifed and entreated him not to
rufli wantonly into the midft of danger. But Luther,
fuperior to fuch terrors, filenced them with this reply,
“ I am lawfully called (faid he) to appear in that
city ; and thither will I go in the name of the Lord,
though as many devils as there are tiles on the houfes
were there combined againft me.”
The reception which he met with at Worms, was
fuch as might have been reckoned a full reward of all
his labours, if vanity and the love of applaufe had been
the principles by which he was influenced. Greater
crowds affembled to behold him than had appeared
at the emperor’s public entry ; his apartments were
daily filled with princes and perfonages of the higheft
rank ; and he was treated with an homage more fin-
cere, as well as more flattering, than any which pre¬
eminence in birth or condition can command. At his
appearance before the diet, he behaved with great de¬
cency, and with equal firmnefs. He readily acknow¬
ledged an excefs of acrimony and vehemence in his
controverfial writings ^ but refufed to retraft his opi¬
nions unlefs he were convinced of their falfehood, or
to confent to their being tried by any other rule than
the word of God. When neither threats nor intreaties
could prevail on him to depart from this refolution,
fome of the ecclefiaftics propofed to imitate the ex¬
ample of the council of Conftance, and, by punithing
the author of this peftilent herefy, who was now in
their power, to deliver the church at once from fuch
an evil. But the members of the diet refufing to ex-
pofe the German integrity to freflr reproach by a fe-
cond violation of public faith, and Charles being no
lefs unwilling to bring a ftain upon the beginning of
his adminiftration by fuch an ignominious a£Hon, Lu¬
ther was permitted to depart in fafety. A few days
after he left the city, a fevere edift was publifhed in
the emperor’s name, and by authority of the diet, de¬
priving him, as an obftinate and excommunicated cri¬
minal, of all the privileges which he enjoyed as a fub-
je<5i of the empire, forbidding any prince to harbour
or protect him, and requiring all to feize his perfon as
foon as the term fpecified in his protection fhould be
expired.
But this rigorous decree had no confiderable eflfeCt j
the execution of it being1 prevented partly by the mul¬
tiplicity of occupations which the commotions in Spain,
together with the wars in Italy and the Low Coun¬
tries, created to the emperor j and partly by a pru¬
dent precaution employed by the eleCtor of Saxony,
Luther’s faithful patron. As Luther, on his return
from Worms, was pafling near Altenftrain in Thurin- Lather.
gia, a number of horlemen in malks ruthed fuddenly
out of a wood, where the eleClor had appointed them
to lie in w7ait fpr him, and furrounding his company,
carried him, after difmiiTing all his attendants, to
Wortburg, a flrong caftle not far ddlant. There the
ele&or ordered him to be fupplied with every thing
neceflary or agreeable 5 but the place of his retreat was
carefully concealed, until the fury of the prefent {form
againft him began to abate, upon a change in the po¬
litical fyftem of Europe. In this folitude, where he
remained nine months, and which he frequently called
his PatJ?ios, after the name of that iiland to which the
apoftle John was banilhed, he exerted his tiiual vigour
and induftry in defence of his dodrines, or in confu¬
tation of his adverfaries, publiftting feveral treatifes,
which revived the fpirit of his followers, aftonithed to
a great degree and diiheartened at the fudden difap-
pearance of their leader.
Luther, weary at length of his retirement, appeared
publicly again at Wittemberg, upon the 6th of March
r522. He appeared indeed without the eledlor’s leave;
but immediately wTrote him a letter to prevent his tak¬
ing it ill. The edicl of Charles V. as fevere as it was,
had given little or no check to Luther’s dodlnne ; for
the emperor was no fooner gone to Flanders, than
his edift was neglefted and defpifed, and the dosftrine
feemed to fpread even failer than before. Carolofta-
dius, in Luther’s abience, had pulhed things on fafter
than his leader ; and had attempted to abolifti the ufe
of mafs, to remove images out of the churches, to fet
afide auricular confefiion, invocation of faints, the ab-
ftaining from meats; had allowed the monks to leave
their monafteries, to negleift their vows, and to marry;
in ftiort, had quite changed the dodlrine and difcipline
of the church at Wittemberg : all which, though not
againft Luther’s fentiments, was yet blamed by him,
as being raflily and unfeafonably done. Lutheranifm
was ftill confined to Get many : it w7as not got to
France ; and Henry VIII. of England made the moft
rigorous a£ts to hinder it from invading his realm.
Nay, he did fomething more : to ftiow his zeal for reli¬
gion and the holy fee, and perhaps his {kill in theo¬
logical learning, he wrote a treatife Of the /even fcicra-
merits, againft Luther’s book Of the captivuij of Babylon ;
which he prefented to Leo X. in October 1521. Tjie
pope received it very favourably ; and was fo well
pleafed with the king of England, that he compliment¬
ed him with the title of Defender of the Faith. Luther,
however, paid no regard to his kingfliip : but anfwer-
ed him with great iharpnefs, treating both his perfon
and performance in the moft contemptuous manner.
Henry complained of Luther’s rude ulage of him to
the princes of Saxony ; and Fiftier, biftiop of Rochef-
ter, replied to his anfwer, in behalf of Henry’s treatife ;
but neither the king’s complaint, nor the biftiop’s re¬
ply, was attended w'ith any vifible eftedfts.
Luther, though he had put a flop to the violent
proceedings of Caroloftadius, now made open war with
the pope and biftiops ; and, that he might make the
people defpife their authority as much as poftible,
he w7rote one book againft the pope’s bull, and
another againft the order falfely called the order of bi-
fbops. The fame year, 1522, he wrote a letter, dated
July the 29th to the affembly of the ftates of Bohemia ;
inn
Luther.
L U T [ 270 ] L U T
m which he affured them that he was labouring to
ehabliih their doctrine in Germany, and exhorted them
not to return to the communion of the church of Rome
and he publifhed alfo this year, a tranflation of the
New Teftament in the German tongue, which was af¬
terwards corredhed by himfelf and Melandlhon. This
tranflation having been printed feveral times, and be¬
ing in every body’s hands, Ferdinand archduke of Au-
ftria, the emperor’s brother, made a very fevere edidf,
to hinder the farther publication of it 5 and forbade all
the fubjefts of his imperial majefty to have any copies
of it, or of Luther’s other books. Some other princes
followed his example j and Luther was fo angry at it,
that he wrote a treatife, Of the fecular power, in which
he accuses them of tyranny and impiety. The diet of
the empire was held at Nuremberg, at the end of the
year; to which Hadrian VI. fent his brief, dated No¬
vember the 25th : for Leo X. died upon the 2d of De¬
cember 1521, and Hadrian had been elecled pope up¬
on the 9th of January following. In this brief, among
other things, he obferves to the diet, how he had heard
with grief, that Martin Luther, after the fentence of
Leo X. which was ordered to be executed by the edidt
of Worms, continued to teach the fame errors, and
daily to publifh books full of herefies : that it appear¬
ed ftrange to him, that fo large and fo religious a na¬
tion could be feduced by a wretched apoftate friar :
that nothing, however, could be more pernicious to
Chriltendom ; and that therefore he exhorts them to
ufe their utmoft endeavours to make Luther, and the
authors of thefe tumults, return to their duty : or, if
they refufe and continue obftinate, to proceed againft
them according to the laws of the empire, and the fe-
verity of the laft edidt.
T he refolution of this diet was publilhed in the form
of an edidf, upon the 6th of March 1523 : but it had
no effedi in checking the Lutherans, who Hill went on
in the fame triumphant manner. This year Luther
wrote a great many pieces : among the reft, one upon
the dignity and office of the fupreme magiftrate;
•which Frederic eledlor of Saxony is faid to have been
highly pleafed with. He fent, about the fame time
a writing in the German language to the Waldenfes,
or Pickards, in Bohemia and Moravia, who had ap¬
plied to him “ about worfhipping the body of Chrift
in the eucharift.” He wrote alfo another book, which
he dedicated to the fenate and people of Prague,
“ about the inftitution of miniiters of the church.”
He drew up a form of faying mafs. He wrote a piece,
entitled, Jin example of popijh doclmne and divinity ;
which Dupin calls a fatire agaivji nuns and thofe who
profcfs a monajlic life. He wrote alfo againft the vows
of virginity, in his preface to his commentary on
i Cor. viii. And his exhortations here were, it feems,
followed with effedls ; for foon after, nine nuns, among
whom was Catharine de Bore, eloped from the nun¬
nery at Nimptfchen, and were brought, bv the affift-
ance of Leonard Coppen, a burgefs of Torgau, to Wit-
temberg. Whatever offence this proceeding might give
to the Papifts, it was highly extolled by Luther; who,
in a book written in the German language, compares
the deliverance of thefe nuns from the flavery of a mo-
naftic life to that of the fouls which Jefus Chrift has
delivered by his death. This year Luther had occa-
fton to canonize two o( his followers, who, as Melchior
3
Adam relates, were burnt at Bruffels in the beginning
of July, and were the firft who fuffered martyrdom for
his doiftrine. He rvrote alfo a confolatory epiftle to
three noble ladies at Mifnia, who were banifhed from
the duke of Saxony’s court at Friburg, for reading his
books.
In the beginning of the year 1524, Clement VIL
fent a legate into Germany to the diet, which was to
be held at Nuremburg. Hadrian VI. died in Oblober
1523, and was fucceeded by Clement upon the 19th of
November. A little before hi^ death he canonized
Benno, who was biffiop of Mdffen in the time of Gre¬
gory VII. and one ef the moft zealous defenders of
the holy fee. Luther, imagining that this was done
diredfly to oppofe him, drew up a piece with this title,
Jlgainjl the New Idol and Old Devilfet up at Meiflen ;
in which be treats the memory of Gregory with great
freedom, and does not fpare even Hadrian. Cle¬
ment VII.’s legate reprefented to the diet of Nurem¬
burg the neceffity of enforcing the execution of the
edidt of Worms, which had been ftrangrly negledled
by the princes of the empire ; but, notwithftanding
the legate’s folicitations, which were very preffing, the
decrees ©f that diet were thought fo ineffectual, that
they were condemned at Rome, and rejedted by the
emperor. It was in this year that the difpute between
Luther and Erafmus, about free-will, began. Erafmus
had been much courted by the Papifts to w’rite againft
Luther ; but he wras all along of opinion, that writing
would not be found an effectual way to end the differ¬
ences and eftabliih the peace of the church. Howt-
ever, tired out at length with the importunities of the
pope and the catholic princes, and denrous at the fame
time to clear himfelf from the fufpicion of favouring
a caufe which he would not feem to favour, he re-
folved to w'rite againft Luther, though, as he tells Me-
landthon, it was wdth fome reluctance, and chofe free¬
will for the fubjedt. His book was intitled, Jl Dial ri¬
ba, or Conference about Free-will; and was written with
much moderation, and without perfonal reftedtions.
He tells Luther in the preface, “ That he ought not
to take his diffenting from him in opinion ill, becaufe
he had allowed himfelf the liberty of differing from the
judgement of popes, councils, univerfities, and dodtors
of the church.” Luther wras fome time before he an-
fwered Erafmus’s book ; but at laft publiffied a treatife
De Servo Arbitrio, or Of the Servitude of Man's Will;
and though Melandthon had promifed Erafmus, that
Imther fhould anfwer him with civility and modera¬
tion, yet Luther had fo little regard to Melandthon’s
promife, that he never wTrote any thing (harper. He
accufed Erafmus of being carelefs about religion, and
little felicitous what became of it, provided the world
continued in peace ; and that his notions were rather
philofophical than Chriftian. Erafmus immediately re¬
plied to Luther, in a piece called Hyperafpiftes ; in the
firft part of which he anfwers his arguments, and in
the fecond his perfonal reflections.
In October 1524, Luther threw off the monaftic ha¬
bit ; which, though not premeditated and defigned,
was yet a very proper preparative to a ftep he took
the year after; we mean, his marriage with Catharine
de Bore. Catharine de Bore was a gentleman’s daugh¬
ter, who had been a nun, and was taken, as we have
obferved, out of the nunnery of Nimptfchen, in the
year
Luther;
L U T . C 27
year 1523. Luther had a defign, as Melchior Adam
related, to marry her to Glacius, a minifler of Orta-
munden ; but Are did not like Glacius ; and fo Luther
married her himfelf upon the 13th of June 1525.
This conduft of his vras blamed not only by the Ca¬
tholics, but, as Melanfthon lays, by thofe of his own
party. He was even for fome time alhamed of it him¬
felf j and owns, that his marriage had made him fo
defpicable, that he hoped his humiliation would rejoice
the angels, and vex the devils. Melan£!hon found him
fo affii&ed with what he had done, that he wrote fome
letters of confolation to him. It was not fo much the
marriage, as the circumflances of the time, and the pre¬
cipitation with which it was done, that occafioned the
cenfures paffed upon Luther. He married all of a hid¬
den, and at a time when Germany tvas groaning under
the miferies of a war which was faid at lead to be
owing to Lutheranifm. Then, again, it was thought
an indecent thing in a man of 42 years of age, who
was then, as he pretended, reftoring the Gofpel, and
reforming mankind, to involve himfelf in marriage with
a woman of 26, either through incontinence, or any
account whatever. But Luther, as foon as he had re¬
covered himfelf a little from this abalhment, affumed
his former air of intrepidity, and boldly fupported what
lie had done with reafons. “ I took a wife (fays he),
in obedience to my father’s commands ; and haftened
the confummation, in order to prevent Impediments,
and flop the tongues of llanderers.” It appears from
his own confeflion, that this reformer was very fond
of Mrs de Bore, and ufed to call her his Catharitie,
which made profane people think and fay wicked
things of him : “ And therefore (fays he) I mar¬
ried of a fudden, not only that I might not be obliged
to hear the clamours which I knew wmuld be railed
againft me, but to flop the mouths of thofe w7ho re¬
proached me with Catharine de Bore.” Luther alfo
gives us to underhand, that he did it partly as con¬
curring with his grand fcheme of oppoling the Catho¬
lics.
Luther, notwithftanding, wTas not himfelf altogether
fatisfied with thefe reafons. He did not think the hep
he had taken could be fufhciently juftified upon the
principles of human prudence •, and therefore wre find
him, in other places, endeavouring to account for it
from a fupernatural impulfe. But w'hether there was
any thing divine in it or not, Luther found himfelf
extremely happy in his new ftate, and efpecially after
his wife had brought him a fon. “ My rib Kate (fays
he in the joy of his heart) defires her compliments to
you, and thanks you for the favour of your kind let¬
ter. She is very well, through God’s mercy. She is
obedient and complying with me in ad things •, and
more agreeable, I thank God, than I could have ex¬
pelled j fo that I wmuld not change my poverty for
the wealth of Croefus.” He rvas heard to fay (Seck-
endorf tells us,) that he would not exchange his wife
for the kingdom of France, nor for the riches of the:
Venetians j and that for three reafons: Becaufe fine had
been given h m by God, at the time when he implored
the affiAance of the Holy Ghofl in finding a good
■wife ; fecondly, Becaufe, though (he was not without
faults, yet (he had fewer than other women ; and,
thirdly, Becaufe (lie religiouOy obferved the conjugal
fidelity fhe owed him. There went at firft a report,
i ) L U T
that Catharine de Bore was brought to bed foon alter L
her marriage with Luther j but Erafmus, who had
wrote that news to his friends, acknowledged the
falfity of it a little after.
His marriage, however, did not retard his aflivity
and diligence in the work of reformation. He revifed
the Augfburg confeffion of faith, and apology for the
Protellants, when the Proteilant religion was firft efta-
blilhed on a firm balls. See Protestants and Re¬
formation.
After this, Luther had little elfe to do than to fit
down and contemplate the mighty work he had finifh-
ed : for that a fingle monk (hould be able to give the
church fo rude a lltock, that there needed but fuch a-
nother entirely to overthrow it, may very well feem a
mighty work. He did indeed little elfe : for the re¬
mainder of his life was fpent in exhorting princes,
ftates, and univerfities, to confirm the reformation
which had been brought about through him ) and pub-
lilhing from time to time fuch writings as might en¬
courage, direct, and aid, them in doing it. The em¬
peror threatened temporal punidiment with armies, and -
the pope eternal with bulls and anathemas ; but Luther
cared for none -of their threats. His friend and co¬
adjutor Melanflhon was not fo indifferent ; for Me-
lanflhon had a great deal of foftnefs, moderation, and
diffidence in his make, which made him very uneafy,
and even forrowful, in the prefent diforders. Hence
wre find many of Luther’s letters written on purpofe to
fupport and comfort him under thefe feveral diftreffes
and anxieties.
In the year 1533, Luther wrote a confolatory
epxftle to the citizens of Ofchatz, who had fuffered
fome hardfhips for adhering to the Augfburg confef¬
fion of faith ; in which, among other things, he fays j
“ The devil is the hoft, and the world is his inn j fo
that wherever you come, you {hall be lure to find this
ugly hoft.” He had alfo about this time a terrible
controverfy with George duke of Saxony, who had
fuch an averlion to Luther’s dotlrine, that he obliged
his fubje£ls to take an oath that they would never em¬
brace it. However, 60 or 70 citizens of Leipfic were
found to have deviated a little from the Catholic way
in fome point or other, and they were known previ-
oufiy to have confulted Luther about it j upon which
George complained to the ele£lor John, that Luther
had not only abuled his perfon, but alfo preached up
rebellion among his lubjedls. The elefilor ordered Lu¬
ther to be acquainted with this ; and to be told at the
fame time, that if he did not clear himfelf of the
charge, he could not poflibly efcape punilhment. But
Luther eafily refuted the accufation, by proving, that
he had been fo far from ftirring up his fubje£ls againft,
him, on the fcore of religion, that on the contrary, he
had exhorted them rather to undergo the greateft hard-
llfips, and even fuffer themfelves to be banilhed.
In the year 1534, the Bible tranllated by him into
German was firft printed, as the old privilege, dated
at Bibliopolis, under the eledlor’s hand, Ihows : and
it was publilhed the year after. He alfo publifhed
this year a book againft maffes and the confecration of
priefts, in which he relates a conference he had with
the devil upon thofe points ■, for it is remarkable in
Luther’s whole hiftory, that he never had any conflicts
oi any kind within, but the devil was always his anta-
L U T [ 272 ] L U T
.Xuther. gonift. In February 1537, an affembly was held at
Smalkald about matters of religion, to which Luther
and Melandlhon were called. At this meeting Lu¬
ther was feized with fo grievous an iilnefs, that there
were no hopes of his recovery. He was afflicted with
the done, and had a ftoppage of urine for 11 days. In
this terrible condition he would needs undertake to tra¬
vel, notwithftanding all that his friends could fay or do
to prevent him : his refolution, however, was attend¬
ed with a good effect; for the night after his departure
he began to be better. As he teas carried along, he
made his will, in which he bequeathed his deteilation
of Popery to his friends and brethren; agreeably to
what he often ufed to fay : Pefiis cram vivus, martens
ero mors tua, papa; that is, “ I was the plague of
Popery in my life, and lhall continue to be fo in my
death.”
This year the pope and the court of Rome, finding
it impoffible to deal with the Proteftants by force, be¬
gan to have recourfe to ftratagem. They affe&ed
therefore to think, that though Luther had indead car¬
ried things on with a high hand and to a violent ex¬
treme, yet what he had pleaded in defence of thefe
meafures was not entirely without foundation. They
talked wdth a feeming fliow of moderation : and Pius
III. who fucceeded Clement VII. propofed a reforma¬
tion firft among themfelves, and even went fo far as to
fix a place for a council to meet at for that purpofe.
But Luther treated this farce as it deferved to be treat¬
ed ; unmafked and detected it immediately \ and, to
ridicule it the more ffrongly, caufed a pifture to be
drawn, in which was reprefented the pope feated on
high upon a throne, fome cardinals about him with
foxes tails on, and feeming to evacuate upwards and
downwards Qfurfum deorjum rcpurgare, as Melchior
Adam expreifes it). This was fixed over againft the
title-page, to let the readers fee at once the fcope and
defign of the book 5 which w'as, to expofe that cunning
and artifice with which thofe fubtle politicians affeft-
ed to cleanfe and purify themfelves from their errors
and fuperftitions. Luther publifhed about the fame
time A Confutation of the pretended Grant of Con-
ftantine to Sylvefter Bifhop of Rome $ and alfo fome
letters of John Hufs, written from his prifon at Con-
fiance to the Bohemians.
In this manner was Luther employed till his death,
which happened in the year 1546. That year, accom¬
panied by Melandthon, he paid a vifit to his own coun¬
try, which he had not feen for many years, and re¬
turned again in fafety. But foon after he was called
thither again by the earls of Mansfeldt, to compofe
lome differences which had arifen about their bounda¬
ries. Luther had not been ufed to fuch matters \ but
becaufe he was born at Eifleben, a town in the territory
of Mansfeldt, he was willing to do his country what
fervice he could, even in this way. Preaching his laft
fermon therefore at Wittemberir, upon the 17th of
January, he fet off on the 23d ; and at Hall in Saxony
lodged with Juftus Jonas, with whom he ftaid three
days, becaufe the waters were out. Upon the 28th,
he paffed over the river with his three fens and
Dr Jonas ; and being in fome danger, he faid to the
Do£tor, “ Do not you think it would rejoice the
devil exceedingly, if I and you, and my three fons,
fhould be drowned ?” When he entered the territories
2
of the earls of Mansfeldt, he was received by 100 Luther,
horfemen or more, and conducled in a very honour-
able manner •, but wras at the lame time fo very ill,
that it was feared he would die. He faid, that thefe
fits of ficknefs often came upon him when he had any
great bufinefs to undertake : of this, however, he did
not recover j but died upon the 18th of February, in
the 63d year of his age. A little berore he expired,
he admonifhed thofe that w’ere about him to pray to
God for the propagation of the Golpel : “ becaufe
((aid he) the council of Trent, which had fat once or
twice, and the pope, would devife ftrange things again ft
it.” Soon after, his body was put into a leaden cof¬
fin, and carried with funereal pomp to the church at
Eifleben, when Dr Jonas preached a fermon upon the
occallon. The earls of Mansfeldt defired that his
body fhould be interred in their territories but the
eledtor of Saxony infilled upon his being brought back
to Wittemberg which was accordingly done : and
there he wras buried with the greateft pomp that
perhaps ever happened to any private man. Princes,
earls, nobles, and Undents without number, attended
the proceffion j and Melanclhon made his funeral ora¬
tion.
A thoufand lies were invented by the PapiUs about
Luther’s death. Some faid that he died fuddenly j
others, that he killed himfelf •, others, that the devil
Urangled him •, others, that his corpfe Uunk fo abomi¬
nably, that they were forced to leave it in the way, as
it was carried to be interred. Nay, lies were invented
about his death, even while he was yet alive. Luther,
however, to give the moU effectual refutation of this
account of his death, put forth an advertifement of his
being alive; and, to be even with the PapiUs for the
malice they had Ihown in this lie, wrote a book at the
fame time to prove, that “ the papacy w’as founded by
the devil.”
Luther’s works were collefled after his death, and
printed at Wittemberg in 7 vols folio. Catharine de
Bore furvived her hufband a few years ; and continued
the firU year of her widowhood at Wittemberg, though
Luther had advifed her to feek another place of reli-
dence. She went from thence in the year 1547, when
the town was furrendered to the emperor Charles V.
Before her departure, Uie had received a prefent of 50
crowns from Chrillian III. king o( Denmark ; and
the eleefor of Saxony, and the counts of Mansfeldt,
gave her good tokens of their liberality. With thele
additions to what Luther had left her, ihe had where¬
withal to maintain herfelf and her family handfomely.
She returned to Wittemberg, when the town was re-
Uored to the elettor ; where fhe lived in a very devout
and pious manner, till the plague obliged her to leave
it again in the year 1552. She fold what Uie had at
Wittemberg : and retired to Torgau, with a refolu¬
tion to end her life there. An unfortunate mifchance
befel her in her journey thither, which proved fatal to
her. The horfes growing unruly, and attempting to
run away, Uie leaped out of the vehicle the was convey¬
ed in ; and, by leaping, got a fall, of which Uie died
about a quarter of a year after, at Torgau, upon the
20th of December 1552. She was buried there in the
great church, where her tomb and epitaph are Uill to
be feen 5 and the univerfity of Wittemberg, which was

Lutheran!fm has undergone fome alterations fince
the time of its founder.—-Luther rejeSed the epiftle of
St James as inconfiftent with the doftrine of St Paul,
in relation to jutlification ; he alfo fet afide the Apoca-
lypfe : both which are now received as canonical in the
Lutheran church.
Luther reduced the number of facraments to two,
viz. baptifm, and the eucharift : but he believed the
impanation, or confubftantiation, that is, that the
matter of the bread and wine remain with the body
and blood of Chrift j and it is in this article that the
main difference between the Lutherans and Englith
churches confifts.
Luther maintained the mafs to be no facrifice 5 ex¬
ploded the adoration of the holt, auricular confeffion,
meritorious works, indulgences, purgatory, the worlhip
of images, &.c. which had been introduced in the cor¬
rupt times of the Rcmifh church. He alfo oppofed tne
dodtrine of free will, maintained predeilination, and af¬
fected our juftification to be folely by the imputation
of the merits and fatisfadtion of Chrift. He alfo op¬
pofed the fallings in the Roman church, monaftical
vows, the celibate of the clergy, &c.
LUTHERANS, the Chriftians who follow the opi¬
nions of Martin Luther, one of the principal reformers
of the church in the 16th century. See Luther.
The Lutherans, of all Proteftants, are thofe who
differ lead from the Romilh church ; as they affirm,
that the body and blood of Chrift are materially pre-
fent in the iacrament of the Lord’s fupper, though in
an inconiprehenlible manner *, and likewile reprefeut
fome religious rites and inftitutions, as the ufe of
images in churches, the diflinguilbing veftments of the
clergy, the private confeftion of fins, the ufe of wTafers
in the adminiftration of the Lord’s fupper, the form of
exorcifrn in the celebration of baptilm, and other ce¬
remonies of the like nature, as tolerable, and fome of
them as ufeful. The Lutherans maintain, with regard
to the divine decrees, that they refpedl the falvation
or mifery of men, in confequence of a previous know¬
ledge of their fentiments and charadlers, and not as
free and unconditional, and as founded on the mere
will of God. Towards the clofe of the laft century,
the Lutherans began to entertain a greater liberality
of fentiment than they had before adopted ; though
in many places they perfevered longer in fevere and
defpotic principles than other Proteftant churches.
Their public teachers now enjoy an unbounded liberty
of diffenting from the decifions of thofe fymbols or
creeds which were once deemed almoft infallible rules
of faith and pra^Hce, and of declaring their diffent in
the manner they judge the moft expedient. Mofheim
attributes this change in their fentiments to the maxim
which they generally adopted, that Chriftians were ac¬
countable to God alone for their religious opinions }
and that no individual could be juftly punfthed by the
magiftrate for bis erroneous opinions, while he con-
ducled bimfelf like a virtuous and obedient fubjedf,
and made no attempts to difturb the peace and order
of civil fociety.

LUXURIANS Flos, H a luxuriant or double
flo’.ver a flower, fome of wliofe parts are increafed
in number, to the diminution or entire exclufion of
others.
The parts that are augmented or multiplied in luxu¬
riant flowers, are the flower-cup and petals, which
Linnaeus conflders as the teguments or covers of the
flower ; the parts that are diminifhed, or entirely ex¬
cluded, are the ftamina or chives, which the fame au¬
thor denominates the male organs of generation.
Luxuriance in flowers is capable of the three follow¬
ing varieties,
1. A flower is faid to be multiplied (yZo.f multipli-
c/7/wj'), when the increafe of the petals is not fuch as to
exclude all the ftamina: in this ienfe, flowers are pro¬
perly faid to be double, triple, or quadruple, according
to the number of multiplications of the petals.
2. A flower is faid to be full (JIqs plertus), when,
by the multiplication of the petals, all the ftamina are
excluded. Such are moft of the double flowers that
engage the attention of florifts.
3. A flower is faid to be PROLIFIC (Jlosprolifer'),
which produces flowers, and fometimes leaves, from its
centre.
For a particular defeription of each of thefe kinds
of luxuriance in flowers, fee the articles Multiplica-
tvs Flos, Plenus Flos, and Prolifer Flos.
Many natural orders of plants do not in any circum-
ftances produce luxuriant flowers. Of this kind are
the mafqued flowers of Tournefort, excepting calve’s-
fnout *, the rough-leaved, umbelliferous, ftarry plants,
and fuch as flower at the joints, of Ray : fome umbel¬
liferous flowers, however, are prolific.
I he pea-bloom, or butterfly-fliaped flowers, are rare¬
ly rendered double ; fome inflances, however, of luxu¬
riance, are obferved in a fpecies of lady’s Anger, coro-
nilla, and broom.
All luxuriant flowers are vegetable monfters. Such
as are pcrfeflly full, by which we mean the greateft
degree of luxuriance, cannot be propagated by feeds j
becaufe thefe, for want of impregnation, can never ri¬
pen. Full flowers therefore are very properly deno¬
minated by Linnaeus eunuchs. This higheft degree of
luxuriance is very common in carnation, lychnis, ane¬
mone, ftock, Indian crefs, rofe, marflr marigold, ra¬
nunculus, violet, peony, and narciffus.
Flowers which do not exclude all the ftamina, per¬
fect their feeds. Of this kind are poppy, fennel flower,
campanula, and fome others.
Some flowers, as thofe of the water-lily, fig-mari¬
gold, and cafhrs, have many rows or feries of petals,
without the number of ftarnina being in the leaft dimi-
nithed. Such flowers are by no means to be reckoned
luxuriant, in the flighteft degree.
Luxuriance in flowers is generally owing to excefs of
ncurifhment.
LUXURY ; voluptuoufnefs, or an extravagant in¬
dulgence in diet, drefs, and equipage.
Luxury, among the Romans, prevailed to fuch a
degree, that feveral laws were made to fupprefs, or
at leaft limit it. The extravagance of the table be¬
gan about the time of the battle of A<ftium, and con¬
tinued in great excefs till the reign of Galba. Pea¬
cocks, cranes of Malta, nightingales, venifon, wild Luxury.
and tame fowl, were confidered as delicacies. A pro- ' y——
fufion of provifions wras the reigning tafte. Whole
wild boars were often ferved up, and fometimes they
were filled with various fmall animals, and birds of
different kinds: this difli they called the Trojan horfe,
in allufion to the wooden horfe filled with foldiers.
Fowls and game of all forts were ferved up in whole
pyramids, piled up in diflies as broad as moderate
tables. Lucullus had a particular name for each
apartment ; and in whatever room he ordered his fer^
vants to prepare the entertainment, they knew by the
direction the expence to which they were to go.
When he flipped in the Apollo, the expence w?as fix¬
ed at 50,000 drachms:, that is 1250I. M. Antony
provided eight boars for 12 guefts. Vitellius had a
large filver platter, faid to have coft a million of fe-
Jlerces, called Minerva's buckler. In this he blended
together the livers of gilt-heads, the brains of phea-
fants and peacocks, the tongues of phenicopters, and
the milts of lampreys. Caligula ferved up to his guefls
pearls of great value diffolved in vinegar ; the fame
was done alfo by Clodius the fon of yEfop the trage¬
dian. Apicius laid afide 90,000,000 of fejlerces, be-
fides a mighty revenue, for no other purpofe but to be
facrificed to luxury 5 finding himfelf involved in debt,
he looked -'over his accounts, and though he had the
Aim of 10,000,000 of fejlcrces ftill left, he poifoned
himfelf for fear of being ftarved to death.
The Roman laws to reftrain luxury were Lex Or chi a,
Fannia, Didia, Licinia, Cornelia, and many others :
But all thefe were too little ; for as riches increafed
amongft them, fo did fenfuality.
What were the ideas of luxury entertained in Eng¬
land about two centuries ago, may be gathered from
the following paffage of Holinlhed j who, in a difeourfe
prefixed to his Hiftory, fpeaking of the increafe of
luxury, fays, “ Neither do I fpeak this in reproach
of any man, God is my judge 5 but to (how, that
I do rejoice rather to fee how God has bleffed us with
his good gifts, and to behold how that in a time
wherein all things are grown to the moft exceflive
prices, wTe yet do find means to obtain and atchieve
fuch furniture as heretofore was impofiible. There
are old men yet dwelling in the village where I remain,
which have noted three things to be marveloufly al¬
tered in England within their found remembrance. One
is the multitude of chimneys lately eredled ; whereas
in their young days there were not above two or three,
if fo many, in moft uplandifh towns of the realm (the
religious houfes, and manor places of their lords, al¬
ways excepted, and peradventure fome great perfon-
ages), but each made his fire againit a reredofs
[ikreen] in the hall where he dreifed his meat and
dined.—The fecond is the great amendment of lodg¬
ing $ for, faid they, our fathers and we ourfelves have
lain full oft upon ftraw pallets covered only with a
ftieet, under coverlits made of a dogfwaine or horhar-
riots (to ufe their own terms), and a good log under
their head inftead of a bolfter.—If it were fo that
the father or goodman of the houfe had a mattrafs,
or flock bed and ftieets, a fack of chaff to reft his
head upon, he thought himfelf to be as well lodged
as the lord of the town. So well were they con¬
tented, that pillows (faid they) were thought meet
qnly
LUX [ 275 ] LUX
Luxury-, only for women in childbed; as for fervants, if they
—"v—had any ftieet above them, it was well; for feldom had
they any under their bodies to keep them from prick¬
ing flraws, that ran oft through the canvas and their
hardened hides.—The third thing they tell of, is the
exchange of treene [wooden] platters into pewter, and
wooden fpoons into lilver or tin j for fo common were
all forts of treene veffels in old times, that a man (hould
hardly find four pieces pewter (of which one was per-
adventure a fait) in a good farmer’s houfe. Again, In
times paft, men were contented to dwell in houfes
builded of fallow, willow, &c. fo that the ufe of oak
was in a manner dedicated wholly unto churches, reli¬
gious houfes, princes palaces, navigation, &c. But
now willow, &c. are rejected, and nothing but oak
anywhere regarded ; and yet fee the change, for when
our houfes were builded of willow, then had we oaken
men 5 but now that our houfes are come to be made of
oak, our men are not only become willow, but a great
many altogether of draw', which is a fore alteration.
In thefe the courage of the owner was a fufficient de¬
fence to keep the houfe in fafety ; but now the aflurance
of the timber muft defend the men from robbing. Now
have we many chimneys, and yet our tenderlins com¬
plain of rheums, catarrhs, and pofes; then had wre
none but reredofes, and our heads did never ach. For
as the fmoke in thofe days w^ere fuppofed to be a fuffi¬
cient hardening for the timber of the houfe 5 fo it was
reputed a far better medicine to keep the goodman and
his family from the quacks or pofe ; wherewith, as then,
very few were acquainted. Again, Our pewterers in
time pall employed the ufe of pewter only upon diffies
and pots, and a few other trifles for fervice 5 w-hereas
now they are grown into fuch exquifite cunning, that
they can in a manner imitate by infufion any form or
falhion, of cup, diffi, fait, bowl, or goblet, which is
made by the goldfmith’s craft, though they be ever fo
curious and very artificially forged. In fome places
beyond the fea, a garniffi of good flat Engliffi pewter
(I fay flat, becaufe diffies and platters in my time be¬
gan to be made deep, and like bafons, and are indeed
more convenient both for fauce and keeping the meat
warm) is efteemed fo precious as the like number of
veflels that are made of fine filver.”
Particular inftances of luxury, in eating, howrever,
might be adduced from an earlier period, furpaffing
even the extravagance of the Romans. Thus, in the
10th year of the reign of Edward IV. (1470), George
Nevill, brother to the earl of Warwick, at his inftal-
ment into the archiepifcopal fee of York, entertained
moft of the nobility and principal clergy, when his
bill of fare was 300 quarters of wheat, 350 tuns of
ale, 104 tuns of wine, a pipe of fpiced wine, 80 fat
oxen, fix wild bulls, 1004 weathers, 300 hogs, 300
calves, 3000 geefe, 3000 capons, 300 pigs, 100 pea¬
cocks, 200 cranes, 200 kids, 2GOQ chickens, 4000
pigeons, 4000 rabbits, 204 bitterns, 4000 ducks, 200
pheafants, 500 partridges, 200 woodcocks, 400 plo¬
vers, 100 curlews, 100 quails, 1000 egrets, 200 rees,
400 bucks, does,, and roebucks, 1506 hot venifon paf-
ties, 4000 cold ditto, 1000 difties of ielly parted, 4000
diffies of jelly plain, 4000 cold cuflards, 2000 hot cuf-
tards, 3co pikes, 3®® breams, eight feals, four porpuf-
fes, 400 tarts. At this feaft the earl of AVarwick wras
fteward, the earl of Bedford treafurer, and Lord Haf-
tings comptroller, with many more noble officers 5 Luxury.
1000 fervitors, 62 cooks, 515 menial apparitors in the
kitchen.—But fuch was the fortune of the man, that
after his extreme prodigality he died in the moft abjedt
but unpitied poverty, vin&us jacuit in fumtna inopia.
And as to drefs, luxury in that article feems to have
attained a great height long before Holinfhed’s time :
For in the reign of Edward III. we find no fewer than
feven fumptuary laws paffed in one feffion of parliament
to reftrain it. It was enabled, that men fervants of
lords, as alfo of tradefmen and artifans, ffiall be content
with one meal of fiffi or fleffi every day ; and the other
meals, daily, ffiall be of milk, cheefe, butter and the
like. Neither ffiall they ufe any ornaments of gold,
filk, or embroidery; nor their wives and daughters any
veils above the price of twelvepence. Artifans and
yeomen fliall not wear cloth above 40s. the whole piece
(the fineft then being about 61. per piece), nor the or¬
naments before named. Nor the women any veils of
filk, but only tljofe of thread made in England. Gen¬
tlemen under the degree of knights, not having icol.
yearly in land, fhall not wear any cloth above 44-
marks the whole piece. Neither ffiall they or their fe¬
males ufe cloth of gbld, filver, or embroidery, &c.
But efquires having 200I. per annum or upwards of
rent, may wear cloths of five marks the whole piece of
cloth ; and they and their females may alfo wear fluff
of filk, filver, ribbons, girdles, or furs. Merchants,
citizens, burghers, and artificers or tradefmen, as well
of London as elfewhere, who have goods and chattels
of the clear value of 500I. and their females, may wear
as is allowed to gentlemen and efquires of look per an¬
num. And merchants, citizens, and burgefles, worth
above 1000I. in goods and chattels, may (and their fe¬
males) wear the lame as gentlemen of 200I. per annum.
Knights of 200 marks yearly may wear cloth of fix
marks the cloth, but no higher j but no cloth of gold,
nor furred with ermine : but all knights and ladies ha¬
ving above 400 marks yearly, up to 1000I. per annum,
may wear as they pleafe, ermine excepted 5 and they
may wear ornaments of pearl and precious ftoncs for
their heads only. Clerks having degrees in cathedrals,
colleges, &c. may wear as knights and efquires of the
fame income. Plowmen, carters, (hepherds, and fuch
like, not having 40s. value in goods or chattels, ffiall
wear no fort of cloth but blanket and rutTet lawn of 1 2d.
and ffiall wear girdles and belts ; and they ffiall only
eat and drink fuitable to their ftations. And whofo-
ever ufes other apparel than is prefcribed by the above
laws ffiall forfeit the lame.
Concerning the general utility of luxury to a Hate,
there is much controverfy among the political writers.
Baron Montefquieu lays it down, that luxury is necef-
fary in monarchies, as in France ; but ruinous to de¬
mocracies, as in Holland. With regard therefore to
Britain, whofe government is compounded of both fpe-
cies, it is held to be a dubious queftion, how far private
luxury is a public evil 5 and, as fuch, cognizable by
public laws. And indeed our legiflators have feveral
times changed their fentiments as to this point ; for for¬
merly there were a number of penal laws exifting to re¬
ftrain excefs in apparel, chiefly made in the reigns of
Edward III. IV. and Henry VIII. a fpeciroen of which
we have inferted above. But all of them it appeared
expedient to repeal at an after period. In fad, although

Luxury luxury will of neceflity increafe according to the influx
II of wealth, it may not be for the general benefit of com-
>7ca°n. merce to ;mp0fe> as jn tlie above cited laws, an abfo-
lute prohibition of every degree of it: yet, for the good
of the public, it may be neceffary that, fuch as go be¬
yond proper bounds in eating, drinking, and wearing,
wdiat by no means is fuitable to their Hation, fhould be
taxed accordingly, could it be done without including
thofe who have a better title to fuch indulgence. This
is certainly, however, a point which ftiould be maturely
weighed before executed j and, in mercantile countries
at leaft, fuch reftraints may be found prejudicial, moft
likely impradlicable, efpecially where true liberty is
cftablilhed. Sir \Villiam Temple obferves, fpeaking
of the trade and riches, and at the fame time of the
frugality of the Hollanders, “ That fome of our max¬
ims are not fo certain as current in politics : as that en¬
couragement of excefs and luxury if employed in the
confumption of native commodities, is of advantage to
trade. It may be fo to that which impoveriilies, but
not to that which enriches a country. It is indeed lefs
prejudicial, if it lies in native than in foreign w-ares :
but the humour of luxury and expence cannot flop at
certain bounds 5 what begins in native will proceed to
foreign commodities *, and though the example arife
among idle perfons, yet the imitation will run into all
degrees, even of thofe men by whofe indufiry the na¬
tion fubfifts. And befides, the more of our own we
fpend, the lefs (hall we have to fend abroad ; and fo it
will come to pafs, that while we drive a vaft trade,
yet, by buying much more than wTe fell, we (hall come
to be poor at daft.”
LYBIA, or Libya, a name anciently given to all
that part of Africa lying between the border of E-
gypt and the river Triton *, and comprehending Cyre-
rtaica, Marmarica, and the Regio Syrtica. See thefe

LYCiEUM, AvTiuov, in antiquity, the name of a
celebrated fchool or academy at Athens, where Ari-
ftotle explained his philofophy. The place was com-
pofed of porticoes and trees planted in the quincunx
form, where the philofophers difputed walking. Hence
philofophy of the Lyeceum is ufed to fignify the philofo¬
phy of Ariftotle, or the Peripatetic philofophy. . Suidas
obferves, that the Lycaeum took its name from its hav¬
ing been originally a temple of Apollo Lycaeus $ or
rather a portico or gallery built by Lycaeus fon of
Apollo } but others mention it to have been built by
Pififtratus or Pericles.
LYCiEUS, in Ancient Geography, a mountain of
Arcadia, facred to Jupiter ; whence Jupiter Lycwus
(Pliny). Sacred alfo to Pan (Virgil) ; and hence Ly-
ccea, the rites performed to Pan on this mountain $
which Evander carrying wdth him to Latium, were
called Lupercalia (Virgil).
LYCAON, in fabulous hiftory, the firft king of
Arcadia, fon of Pelafgus and Meliboea. He built a
town called Lycofura, on the top of Mount Lycaeus,
In honour of Jupiter. He had many wives, by wdiom
he had a daughter called Callifto, and 50 fons. He
was fucceeded on the throne by Nydtimus, the eldeft of
his fons. He lived about 1820 years before the Chrif-
tian era.—Another king of Arcadia, celebrated for his
cruelties. He was changed into a wolf by Jupiter, be-
caufe he offered human vi&ims on the altar of the god
Pan. Some attribute this metamorphofis to another Lycaonia
caufe. The fins of mankind, as they relate, were be- II
come fo enormous, that Jupiter vifited the earth to pu-.
nifh wdckednefs and impiety. He came to Arcadia,
where he was announced as a god, and the people be¬
gan to pay proper adoration to his divinity. Lycaon,
however, who ufed to facrifice all ftrangers to his ivan-
ton cruelty, laughed at the pious prayers of his fubjedlsj
and to try the divinity of the god, he ferved up human
fleflr on his table. This impiety fo irritated Jupiter,
that he immediately deftroyed the houfe of Lycaon,
and changed him into a w'olf.
LYCAONIA, in Ancient Geography, a fmall coun¬
try of the Hither Afia, contained between Pamphylia
to the fouth, Cappadocia to the north, Pilidia and Pnry-
gia to the w'eft, and Armenia Minor to the eaft. Ly-
caones, the people. This country, though fituated
very near Mount Taurus, and part of it on it, yet the
Rpmans reckoned it in Afia intra Taurum. Arca¬
dia, anciently called Lycaonia (Stephanus.)—Alfo an
iftand in the Tiber, joined to Rome by a bridge, and
to the land by another, namely, the Ceilius and Fabric

tany Index.
LYCIA, a country of Afia Minor, bounded by the
Mediterranean on the fouth, Caria on the wreft, Pam¬
phylia on the eaft, and Phrygia on the north. It was
anciently called Milyas and Tremile, from the Milyae,
or Solymi, a people of Crete, who came to fettle there.
The country received the name of Lycia from Lycus
the fon of Pandion, wdio eftabliftied himfelf there.
The inhabitants have been greatly commended by all
the ancients for their fobriety and juftice. They were
conquered by Croefus king of Lydia, and afterwards
by Cyrus. Though they were fubjeft to the power of
Perfia, yet they were governed by their own kings,
and only paid a yearly tribute to the Perfian monarch.
They became part of the Macedonian empire when A-
lexander came into the eaft, and afterwards were ceded
to the houfe of the Seleucidae. The country was
reduced into a Roman province by the emperor Clau¬
dius.

of different ftiapes ; but the moft: common kind rife into
a femiorbicular form, and are hollow' withint fomewhat
refembling an acorn-cup \ this hollow is found fome-
times empty, and fometimes filled with the ftratum in
which it is immerfed. Many of them have an outer
circle, of a different colour from the reft.
LYCOMEDES, in fabulous hiftory, a king of Scy-
ros, an ifland in the iEgean fea. He w as fon of Apollo

care of young Achilles, wdiom his mother Thetis had
difguifed in woman’s clothes, to remove him from the
Trojan war, where {he knew he muft unavoidably pe-

the emiflaries of Mneftheus, led Thefeus to an elevated
place, on pretence to (how him the extent of his domi¬

304 B. C. and, according to Ovid, was killed by an
arrow. He wrote 20 tragedies; but all his works are
loft, except a poem entitled Cajfandra, w’hich contains
a long train of predictions, w’hich he fuppofes to
have been made by Caffandra, Priam’s daughter.
This poem is extremely obfcure. The belt edition of
it is that of Dr Potter, printed at Oxford in 1697,

near the Mediterranean ; the other in the Thebais, or
Higher Egypt, in the northern part, to the weft of the

LYCURGIA, a feftival obferved by the Spartans,
in memory of their lawgiver Lycurgus, whom they ho¬
noured with a temple and anniverfary facrifice.
LYCURGUS, the celebrated legiflator of the Spar¬
tans, was the fon of Eunomes king of Sparta. He
travelled to Greece, to the ifte of Crete, to Egypt, and
even to the Indies, to converfe with the fages and learn¬
ed men of thofe countries, and to learn their manners,
their cuftoms, and their laws. After the death of his
brother PolydeCtes, who w7as king of Sparta, his wi¬
dow7 offered the crown to Lycurgus, promiftng that fhe
wrould make herfelf mifcarry of the child of which fhe
was pregnant, provided he would marry her j but Ly¬
curgus nobly refufed thefe advantageous offers, and af¬
terwards contented himfelf with being tutor to his ne¬
phew Charillus, and reftored to him the government
when he came of age ; but notwuthftanding this regular
and generous conduCI, he wras accufed of a defign to
ufurp the crown. This calumny obliged him to retire
to the ifland of Crete, wdiere he applied himfelf to the
ftudy of the laws and cuftoms of nations. At his return
to Lacedemon, he reformed the government: and, to
prevent the diforders occafioned by luxury and the love
of riches, he prohibited the ufe of gold and filver j pla¬
ced all the -citizens in a ftate of equality 5 and intro¬
duced the ftridfteft temperance, the moft exadt dif-
cipline, and thofe admirable laws wftiich (a few except¬
ed) have been celebrated by all hiftorians. It is faidj
that, to engage the Lacedemonians to obferve them Lydd
inviolably, he made them promife with an oath not to Jl
change any part of them till his return ; and that he ‘ A
afterwards went to the ifland of Crete, where he killed
himfelf, after having ordered that his afhes fhould be
thrown into the fea, fcV fear leaf! if his body fhould be
carried to Sparta the Lacedemonians would think them-
felves abfolved from their oath. He flourished about
870 B. C.
LYDD, a town of England, in Kent, twro miles
and a half fouth-weft of Romney, of which town and
port it is a member, and 7 1 miles from London. It is
a populous towrn, and is incorporated by the name o-’ a
bailiff, jurats, and commonalty. In the beach near
Stone-end, is a heap of ftones, fancied to be the tomb
of Crifpin and Crifpianus ; and near the fea is a piace
called Holmjlone, confifting of beach and pebble-ftones,
which abounds w7ith holm trees.
LYDGATE, John, called the Monk of Bury ; not,
as Cibber conjectures, becaufe he was a native of that
place, for he w7as born about the year 1380, in the vil¬
lage of Lydgate : but becaufe he was a monk of the
BenediCtine convent at St Edmund’s-Bury. After ftu-
dying fome time in our Englifh univerfities, he travel¬
led to France and Italy : and, having acquired a com¬
petent knowledge of the languages of thofe countries,
he returned to London, where he opened a fchool, in
wftiich he inftruCted the fons of the nobility in polite li¬
terature. At what time he retired to the convent of
St Edmund’s-Bury, does not appear •, but he w7as cer¬
tainly there in 1415. He was living in 1446, aged
about 66 ; but in wftiat year he died is not known.
Lydgate, according to Pits, was an elegant poet, a
perfuafive rhetorician, an expert mathematician, an
acute philofopher, and a tolerable divine. He w7as a
voluminous writer; and, confidering the age in which
he lived, an excellent poet. His language is lefs obfo-
lete, and his verfification much more harmonious, than
the language and verfification of Chaucer, who w7rote
about half a century before him. He wnote, 1. Pliftory
of the Theban war, printed at the end of Chaucer’s

LYDIA, in Ancient Geography, a celebrated king¬
dom of Afia Minor.—All the ancient writers tell us,
that Lydia was firft called Meeonia or Meonia, from
Meon king of Phrygia and Lydia ; and that it was
known under no other denomination till the reign of
Atys, when it began to be called Lydia from his fon
J--ydus. Bochart finding in his learned colle&ion of
Phoenician w7ords the verb lu%, fignifying “ to wind,”
and obferving that the country we are fpeaking of is
wratered by the Maeander fo famous for its windings,
concludes that it w7as thence named Lydia, or Ludia.
As.
L Y D [ 278 ]
As to the ancient nanie of Mceonia, he takes it to be a phale a queen of
L Y D
Greek tranfiation of the Phcenician word lud; wherein
he agrees in fome meafure with Stephanus, who derives
the name of Maeonia from Mteon the ancient name
of the Mseander. Some take the word meeonia to be
a t ran flat ion of a Hebrew word flgnifying “ metal,”
becaufe that country, fay they, was in former times
enriched above any other with mines. Though Lydia
and Majonia are by moft authors indifferently ufed for
one and the fame country, yet they are fometimes
diftinguiflied ; that part where Mount Tmolus flood,
watered by the Pa&ohis, being properly called M<ro-
ma; and the other, lying on the coaft, Lydia. This
diftinftion is ufed by Homer, Callimachus, Dionyfius,
and other ancient writers. In after ages, when the
lonians, who had planted a colony on the coaft of the
Egean fea, began to make fome figure, that part was
called Ionia, and the name of Lydia given to the an¬
cient Maeonia.—Lydia, according to Pliny, Ptolemy,
and other ancient geographers, was bounded by My-
lia Major on the north, by Caria on the fouth, by
Phrygia Major on the eaft, and Ionia on the weft, ly¬
ing betwreen the 37th and 39th degrees of north lati¬
tude. What the ancients ftyle the kingdom of Lydia
was not confined within thefe narrow boundarie-s, but
extended from Halys to the Egean fea. Pliny’s de-
fcription includes iEolia, lying between the Hermus
and the Caicus.
As to the origin of the Lydians, Jofephus, and
after him all the ecclefiaftical writers, derive them
from Lud, Shem’s fourth fon •, but this opinion has
no other foundation than the fimilitude of names.
Some of the ancients will have the Lydians to be a
mixed colony of Phrygians, Myfians, and Carians.
Others finding fome conformity in religion and reli¬
gious ceremonies between the Egyptians and Tufcans
who were a Lydian colony, conclude them, without
any farther evidence, to be originally Egyptians. All
we know" for certain is, that the Lydians w'ere a very
ancient nation, as is manifeft from their very fables;
for Atys, Tantalus, Pelops, Niobe, and Arachne, are
all faid to have been the children of Lydus. And Zan-
thus in his I.ydiaca, quoted by Stephanus, informs us,
that the ancient city of Afcalon, one of the five fa-
trapies of the Pbiliftines, mentioned in the books of
Jolhua and the Judges, wjas built by one Afcalus a Ly¬
dian, whom Achiamus king of Lydia had appointed to
command a body of troops which he fent, we know’
not on what occafion, into Syria. The Heraclidm,
or kings of Lydia defcended from Hercules, began to
reign before the Trojan w’ar 5 and had been preceded
by a long feries of fovereigns fprung from Atys, and
hence fly led Atyadce; a flrong proof of the antiquity of
that kingdom.
The Lydians began very early to be ruled by kings,
whofe government fi ems to have been truly defpotic,
and the crown hereditary. We read of three diftindl
races of kings reigning over Lydia, viz. the Atyadse,
the Heraclidae, and the Mermnada?.
1 he Atyada: were fo called from Atys the fon of Co-
tys, and grandfon of Manes the firft Lydian king. But
the hiftory of this family is obfcure and fabulous.
1 he Atyadae were fucceeded by the Heraclidce, or
the defendants of Hercules. For Hercules being,
by the direftion of the oracle, fold as a flave to Om-
3
Lydia, to expiate the murder of
Iphitus, had, during his captivity, by one of her'-
flaves, a fon named C/eo/aus, whofe grandfon Argon
was the firft of the Heraclidae that afcended the throne
of Lydia. This race is faid to have reigned 505
years, the fon fucceeding the father for 22 genera¬
tions. They began to reign about the time of the
Trojan war. The laft of the family was the unhappy
Candaules, who loft both his life and kingdom by' his
imprudence : An event of wfliich we have the following
account by Herodotus. Candaules had a wife whom
he paffionately loved, and believed the moft beautiful
of her fex. He extolled her charms to Gyges his fa¬
vourite, w'hom he ufed to intruft with his moft import¬
ant aftairs ; and the more to convince him of her beau¬
ty, refolved to (how her to him quite naked : he accord-
ingly placed him in the porch of her chamber where
the queen ufed to undrefs when (he w-ent to bed, or¬
dering him to retire after he Ihould have feen her,
and take all poflible care not to be obferved. But
notwfitbftanding all the caution he could ufe, (he plain¬
ly difcovered him going out; and though ftie did not
doubt but it was her hufband’s contrivance, yet Ihe
paffed that night in a feeming tranquillity, fuppref-
ftng her refentment till next morning, when ftie fent
for Gyges, and refolutely told him that he mult either
by his death atone for the criminal a6tion he had been
guilty of, or put to death Candaules the contriver of
it, and receive both her and the kingdom of Lydia
for his reward. Gyges at firft earneftly begged of
her that ftie would not drive him to the neceflity of
fueh a choice. But finding that he could not prevail
with her, and that he muft either kill his mafter or
die himfelf, he chofe the former part of the alterna¬
tive. Being led by the queen to the fame place where
her hufband had polled him the night before, he flab-
bed the king while he was afleep, married the queen,
and took polfeflion of the kingdom, in which he was
confirmed by the anfwer of the Delphic oracle. The
Lydians having taken up arms to revenge the death
of their prince, an agreement v/as made between
them and the followers of Gyges, that if the oracle
ftiould declare him to be lawful king of Lydia, he fhould
be permitted to reign-, if not, he fhould refign the
crown to the Heraclidae. The anfwer of the oracle pro¬
ving favourable to Gyges, he was univerfally acknow¬
ledged for lawful king of Lydia. Candaules is faid to
have purchafed a pielure painted by Bularchas, re-
prefenting a battle of the Magnetes, for its weight in
gold 5 a circumftance which fliows how early the art
of painting began to be in requeft, for Candaules was
cotetnporary with Romulus.
Gyges having thus poffeffed himfelf of the kingdom
of Lydia, fent many rich and valuable prefents to
the oracle of Delphos, among others, fix cups of
gold weighing 30 talents, and greatly efteemed for
the workmanflflp. He made war on Miletus and
Smyrna, took the city of Colophon, and fubdued the
whole country of Troas. In his reign, and by his
permiflion, the city of Abydus was built by the Mi-
lefians. Plutarch and other writers relate his accef-
fion to the crown of Lydia in a quite different man¬
ner, and tells us, without making any mention of the
queen, that Gyges rebelled againft Candaules and flew
him in an engagement. In Gyges began the third
Lydia
L Y D [ 279 ] L Y D
race called MermnacLe ; who were alio, properly fpeak-
lug, Heraclidee, being defcended from a ion of Her¬
cules by Omphale. Gyges reigned 38 years, and was
fucceeded by his fon Ardyes.
This prince carried on the war againfl: the Mile-
iians which his father had begun, and poffeiTed him-
felf of Priene, in thofe days a ilrong city. In his
reign the Cimmerians invaded and overran all Aiia Mi¬
nor 5 but what battles were fought between the Ly¬
dians and thefe invaders, and with what fuccefs, we
find no where mentioned. Herodotus only informs us,
that in the time of Ardyes they poffefled themfelves
of Sardis, the metropolis of Lydia, but could never
.reduce the caftle. Ardyes reigned 49 years, and was
fucceeded by his fon Sadyattes, who reigned 12 years,
and warred moft part of his reign with the Milefians.
After him came his fon Alyattes, who for the fpace
of five years continued the rvar which his father had
begun againlt the Milefians, ravaging their country,
and about harveit time carrying away all their corn
yearly^, in order to oblige them, for want of provi-
fions, to furrender their city, w'hich he knew he could
not reduce any other way, the Milefians being at that
time mailers of the fea. In the 1 2th year of this war
the Lydians having fet fire to the corn in the fields,
the flames wrere carried by a violent wind, which hap¬
pened to blow at that time, to the temple of Minerva
at Affefus, and burnt it down to the ground. Not
long after, Alyattes falling fick, fent to confult the
oracle at Delphos ; which refufed to return any an-
fwer till fuch time as the king Ihould rebuild the temple
of Minerva at Affefus. Alyattes, thus warned, de-
fpatched ambaffadors to Miletus, enjoining them to
conclude a truce with the Milefians till the temple
ihould be rebuilt. On the arrival of the ambaffadors,
Thrafybulus, then king of Miletus, commanded all
the com that w7as at that time in the city to be brought
into the market-place, ordering the citizens to ban¬
quet in public, and revel as if the city were plentiful¬
ly ftored with all manner of provifions. This ftratagem
Thrafybulus praftifed, to the end that the ambaffadors
feeing fuch quantities of corn, and the people every¬
where diverting themfelves, might acquaint their mailer
with their affluence, and divert him from purfuing the
war. As Thrafybulus had defigned, fo it happened *,
for Alyattes, who believed the Milefians gieatly diflreff-
ed for provifions, receiving a different account from his
ambaffadors, changed the truce into a laliing peace, and
ever afterwards lived in amity and friendthip with Thra¬
fybulus and the Milefians. He wTas fucceeded, after a
reign of 57 years, by his fon Crcefus, whofe uninterrupt¬
ed profperity, in the firli years of his reign, far eclipfed
the glory of all his predeceffors. He was the firll that
made war on the Ephefians, whofe city he befieged and
took notwithftanding their confecrating it to Diana, and
fafiening the ivalls by a rope to her temple, which wras
feven lladia diflant from the city. After the redudlion
of Ephelus he attacked, under various pretences, the
lonians and /Eolians, obliging them, and all the other
Greek Hates of Alia, to pay him a yearly tribute.
Elaving met with fuch extraordinary fuccefs by land,
the Lydian prince determined to render his povver e-
qually confpicuous by fea. Tor this purpofe he thought
ferioufly of equipping a fleet •, with which he purpofed
to invade and conquer the Grecian iflands direftly front¬
ing his dominions. But this defign, which, confidering
the flow' progreis in maritime power among the nations
moft diligent to attain it, w’ould probably have failed
of fuccefs, was prevented by the advice of a philofoplu-
cal traveller conveyed in fuch a lively turn of wit, as
eaiily changed the refolution of the king. Bias of
Priene in Ionia, fume fay Pittacus of Mitylene in the
ille of Lelbos, while he travelled after the Grecian cuf-
tom, from curiofity and a love of know ledge, was pre-
fented to Croefus at the Lydian court ; and being afked
by that prince what news from Greece j he aniwered
wdth a republican freedom, that the iflanders had col-
ledted powerful fquadrons of cavalry with an intention
of invading Lydia. “ May the gods grant (find Croe-
fus), that the Greeks, who are unacquainted with horfe-
manlhip, fliould attack the difciplined valour of the Ly¬
dian cavalry j there w7ould foon be an end to the con-
tert.” “ In the lame manner (replied Bias), as if the
Lydians, wrho are totally unexperienced in naval affairs,
Ihould invade the Grecians by fea.” Struck by the
aeutenefs of this unexpected oblervation, Crcefus de-
filted from his intended expedition again!! the iflands,
and inftead of employing new means for extending
his conquefts, determined peaceably to enjoy the lau¬
rels which he had won, and to difplay the grandeur
which he had attained. But his happinefs was foon
after allayed by the death of his favourite fon Atys,
who was unfortunately killed at the chafe of a wild
boar. For this lofs he continued difconfalate for two
years and in a ftate of inadtion, till the conquefts of
Cyrus, and growing power of the Perfians, roufed up
his martial fpirit, and diverted his mind to other
thoughts. He apprehended that the fuccefs which
attended Cyrus in all his undertakings, might at lalt
prove dangerous to himfelf, and therefore refolved to
put a Hop, if poflible, to his progrefs. In taking this
refolution, which might probably be attended wdth
the molt important confequences, he was defirous to
learn the will of heaven concerning the iffue of the w7ar.
The principal oracles w7hich he confnlted were thofe
oi Branchis in Ionia, of Hammon in Libya, and of
Delphi in Greece. Among thefe refpedted Ihr-ines,
the oracle of Delphi maintained its afcendant, as
the molt faithful interpreter of fate. Crcefus wras
fully perfuaded of its veracity ; and defirous generoully
to compenfate for the trouble which he had already
given, and Hill meant to give, the priefts of Apollo,
he facriflced 3000 oxen to the god, and adorned his
Ihrine wdth dedications equally valuable for the work-
manfhip and for the materials j precious veffels of
fiiver, ew'ers of iron beautifully inlaid and enamelled ;
various ornaments of pure gold, particularly a golden
lion weighing ten talents, and a female figure three
cubits or near five feet high. In return for thefe mag¬
nificent prefents, the oracle, in ambiguous language,
flattered Crcefus with obtaining an eafy victory over
his enemies, and wdth enjoying a long life and a pro-
fperous reign. The god at the fame time enjoined
him to contract an alliance wdth the molt powerful of
the Grecian Hates.
Elevated with thefe favourable predictions of Apollo,
Croefus prepared to yield a ready obedience to the on¬
ly condition required on his part for the accomplilh-
ment oi his alpiring purpofe. Not deeming him-
fell fufficiently acquainted with the affairs of Greece,
to
L Y D [
Lydia, to know what particular republic was meant by the
^ oracle, he made particular inquiry of thofe beft in¬
formed concerning the Hate of Europe ; and difcovered,
that among all the members of the Grecian confede¬
racy, the Athenians and Lacedemonians were juftly
•entitled to the pre-eminence. In order to learn which
of thcl'e communities deferved the epithet of mojl power¬
ful, it was neceffary to fend ambaffadors into Greece.
The Lydians defpatched with this important commif-
fion, foon difcovered that the Athenians after having
been long harafled by internal diflenfions, were a&unlly
governed by the tyrant Pilillratus. The Spartans, on
the other hand, though anciently the worll regulated
of all the Grecian communities, had enjoyed domeftic
peace and foreign profperity ever fince they had a-
dopted the wife inftitutions of Lycurgus. After that
memorable period, they had repeatedly conquered the
warlike Argives, triumphed over the hardy Arcadians j
and notwithllanding the heroic exploits of Ariftomenes,
fubdued and endaved their unfortunate rivals of Mef-
fene. To the Lydian ambaifadors therefore, the Spar¬
tan republic appeared to be pointed out by the oracle
as the community whofe alliance they were enjoined
to folicit. Having repaired accordingly to Sparta,
they were introduced not only to the kings and fe¬
rrate, but, as the importance of the negociation re¬
quired, to the general aflembly of the Lacedemonians,
to whom they, in few words, declared the objeft of
their commiffion ; “ We are lent, O Lacedemonians !
by Croefus, king of the Lydians and of many other na¬
tions, who being commanded by the oracle of Apollo
to feek the friendlhip of the moft powerful people of
Greece, now fummons you, who juftly merit that epi¬
thet, to become his faithful allies, in obedience to the
will of the god whofe authority you acknowledge.”
The Lacedemonians, pleafed with the alliance of a
warlike king, and ftill more with the fame of their va¬
lour, readily accepted the propofal. To the ftridt con¬
nexion of an offenfrve and defenfrve league, they joined
the more refpefted ties of facred hofpitality. A few
years before this tranfaftion, they had fent to purchafe
gold at Sardis for making a ftatise of Apollo. Croefus
had on that occafion gratuitoufly fupplied their want.
Remembering this generofity, they gave the Lydian
ambaffadors at their departure, as a prefent for their
mafter, a veffel of brafs containing 300 amphoras
(above 12 hogfheads), and beautifully carved on the
outfide with various forms of animals.
Croefus, having thus happily accompliflred the de-
fign recommended by the oracle, was eager to fet out
upon his intended expedition. He had formerly en¬
tered into alliance with Amafis king of Egypt, and
Labynetus king of Babylon. He had now obtained
the friendfhip of the moft warlike nation of Europe.
The newly railed powder of Cyrus and the Perfians
feemed incapable of refilling fuch a formidable confe¬
deracy.
Elevated with thefe flattering ideas of his own in¬
vincible greatnefs, Croefus waited not to attack the
Perfian dominions until he had collected the ftrength
of his allies. The fanguine impetuolity of his temper,
unexperienced in adverfity, unfortunately precipitated
him into meafures no lefs ruinous than daring. At¬
tended only by the arms of Lydia, and a numerous
band of mercenaries, whom his immenfe wealth enabled
2
280 ] L Y D
him at any time to call into his fervice, he marched
towards the river Halys •, and having croffed with
much difficulty that deep and broad ftream, entered
the province of Cappadocia, which formed the weftern
frontier of the Median dominions. That unfortunate
country foon experienced all the calamities of invafion.
The Pterian plain, the moft beautiful and the moft
fertile diftridl of Cappadocia, was laid wafte ; the
ports of the Euxine, as wTell as feveral inland cities,
w7ere plundered •, and the inoffenlive inhabitants were
either put to the fword or dragged into captivity.
Encouraged by the unrefifting foftnefs of the natives
of thofe parts, Crcefus was eager to pufh forwards ;
and if Cyrus did not previoufly meet him in the field,
he had determined to proceed in triumph to the moun¬
tains of Perfia. Againft this dangerous refolution
he wras in vain exhorted by a Lydian named Sandanis 5
who, wben alked his opinion of the war, declared it
with that freedom which the princes of the eaft have
in every age permitted, amidft all the pride and ca¬
prices of defpotic power, to men diftinguilhed by the
gifts of nature or education. “ You are preparing,
O king, to march againft a people who lead a labo¬
rious and a miferable life ; whofe daily fubfiftence is
often denied them, and is always-fcanty and precarious;
who drink only water, and who are clothed with the
fkins of wild beafts. What can the Lydians gain by
the ccnqueft of Perfia ; they who enjoy all the ad¬
vantages of which the Perfians are deftitute ? For my
part, I deem it a bleffing of the gods, that they have
not excited the warlike poverty of thefe miferable bar¬
barians to invade and plunder the luxurious wealth of
Lydia.” The moderation of this advice w^as rejected
by the fatal prefumption of Crcefus; who confounding
the didates of experienced wifdom with the mean fug-
geftions of pufillanimity, difmiffed the counfellor with
contempt.
Meanwhile, the approach of Cyrus, who was not of
a temper to permit his dominions to be ravaged wdth
impunity, afforded the Lydian king an opportunity of
bringing the war to a more fpeedy iffue than by his in¬
tended expedition into Perfia. The army of Cyrus
gradually augmented on his march : the tributary
princes cheerfully contributing with their united
ftrength towards the affiftance of a mafter whofe va¬
lour and generofity they admired, and who now took
arms to proted the fafety of his fubjeds, as well as to
fupport the grandeur of his throne. Such was the ra¬
pidity of his movement, efpecially after being inform¬
ed of the deftrudive ravages of the enemy in Cappa¬
docia, that he arrived from the fliores of the Cafpian
to thofe of the Euxine fea before the army of Crcefus
had provided the neceffaries for their journey. That
prince, wherr apprifed of the neighbourhood of the
Perfians, encamped on the Pterian plain ; Cyrus like-
wife encamped at no great diftance ; frequent Ikirmilhes
happened between the light troops ; and at length a
general engagement was fought with equal fury and
perfeverance, and only terminated by the darknefs of
night. The lofs on both fides hindered a renewal of
the battle. The numbers, as well as the courage of
the Perfians, much exceeded the expedation of Croe¬
fus. As they difcovered not any intention to harafs
his retreat, he determined to move back towards Sar¬
dis, to fpend the winter in the amufements of his pa¬
lace ;
Lydia.
L Y D [ 281 ] L Y D
Lydia, lace •, and after fummoning his numerous allies to his
tlandard, to take the field early in the fpring with fuch
increafe of force as feemed fufhcient to overpower the
Perfians.
But this defign was defeated by the careful vigilance
of Cyrus. That experienced leader allowed the ene¬
my to retire without moleftation j carefully informing
himfelf of every ftep which they took, and of every
meafure which they feerned determined to purfue.
Patiently watching the opportunity of a juft revenge,
he waited until Croefus had re-entered his capital, and
had dilbanded the foreign mercenaries, who compofed
the moft numerous divifion of his army. It then feem¬
ed the proper time for Cyrus to put his Perfians in
motion 5 and fuch w’as his celerity, that he brought
the firft news of his own arrival in the plain of Sardis.
Croefus, whofe firmnefs might well have been lhaken
by the imminence of this unforefeen danger, was not
wanting on the prefent occafion to the duties which he
owed to his fame and the luftre of the Lydian throne.
Though his mercenaries were dilbanded, his own fub-
jedls, who ferved him hom attachment, who had been
long accuftomed to vidlory, and who were animated
with a high fenfe of national honour, burned with a
defire of enjoying an opportunity to check the daring
infolence of the invaders. Croefus indulged and en¬
couraged this generous ardour. The Lydians in that
age fought on horfeback, armed with long fpears -y the
ftrength of the Perfians confifted in infantry. They
were fo little accuftomed to the ufe of horfes, that ca¬
mels were almoft the only animals which they employ¬
ed as beafts of burden. This circumftance fuggefted
to a Mede, by name Harpagus, a ftratagem, which
being communicated to Cyrus, was immediately adopt¬
ed with approbation by that prince. Harpagus, hav¬
ing obferved that horfes had a ftrong averfion to the
ftiape and fmell of camels, advifed the Perfian army to
be drawn up in the following order: All the camels
which had been employed to carry baggage and pro-
vifions were collefled into one body, arranged in a long
line fronting the Lydian cavalry. The foot foldiers of
the Perfians were ported immediately behind the line,
and placed at a due diftance. The Median horfe (for
a few fquadrons of thefe followed the ftandard of Cy¬
rus) formed the rear of the army. As the troops on
both fides approached to join battle, the Lydian caval¬
ry, terrified at the unufual appearance of the camels,
mounted with men in arms, wrere thrown into difor-
der, and turning their heads, endeavoured to efcape
from the field. Crcelus, who perceived the confufion,
was ready to defpair of his fortune ; but the Lydians,
abandoning their horfes, prepared with uncommon
bravery to attack the enemy on foot. Their courage
deferyed a better fate j but unaccuftomed as they were
to this mode of fighting, they were received and repel¬
led by the experienced valour of the Perfian infantry,
and obliged to take refuge within the fortified ftrength
of Sardis, where they imagined themfelves fecure. The
walls of that city bid defiance to the rude art of at¬
tack, as. then praaifed by the moft warlike nations.
If the Perfian army ftrould invert it, the Lydians were
provided with provilions for feveral years; and there
was reafon to expetfl, that in a few months, and even
weeks, they would receive fuch afliftance from Egypt,
Babylonia, and Greece (to which countries they "had
Vol. XII. Part L
already fent ambafladors), as tvould oblige the Per¬
fians to raife the fiege.
The Lydian minifters defpatched into Greece met
with great fympathy from the Spartans. That people
were particularly obfervant of the faith of treaties j
and while they punilhed their enemies with unexamp¬
led feverity, they behaved with generous compaftion
towards thole whom they had once accepted for allies.
1 hey immediately refolved therefore to fend him a
fpeedy and effeftual relief j and for this purpofe af-
fembled their troops, made ready their veffels, and
prepared every thing neceffary for the expedition.
The valour of the Spartans might perhaps have
upheld the finking empire of Lydia; but before their
armament could fet fail, Croefus wras no longer a fove-
reign. Notwithftanding the ftrength of Sardis, that
city had been taken by ftorm on the 20th day of the
fiege ; the walls having been fcaled in a quarter, which,
appealing altogether inacceflible, was too carelefsly
guarded. This was effedled by the enterprife of Hy-
reades a Mede, who accidentally obferved a centinel
defcend part of the rock in order to recover his hel¬
met. Hyreades was a native of the mountainous pro¬
vince of Mardia, and being accuftomed to clamber
over the dangerous precipices of his native country,
refolved to try his activity in pafling the rock upon
which he had difcovered the Lydian. The defign was
more eafily accompli (lied than he had reafon to ex ¬
pert : emulation and fuccefs encouraged the braveft of
the Perfians to follow his example j thefe were fup-
ported by greater numbers of their countrymen ; the
garrifon of Sardis was furprifed ; the citadel ftormed ;
the rich capital of Lower Afia fubjected to the venge¬
ful rapacity of an indignant vidtor. Thus ended the
ancient kingdom of Lydia, which continued fubjeft to
the Perfians till they alfo were conquered by the Mace¬
donians. For the fate of the Lydian monarch, fee the

town, near the fea, are however often overflowed by
the fpring tides 10 or 12 feet. There are guns planted
for defence both of the Cobb and the town, the ffiore
here being very proper for batteries. The cuftomhoule
ftands on pillars, with the corn market under it. There
is an alms-houfe in Church ftreet, alfo Prelhyterian and
Anabaptift meeting-houfes. The town hall is near
Broad-ftreet. The church ftands at the eaft end of
the town on a riling ground. The market here is
Friday, and there are two fairs in the year. -We read,
that in 774, the Saxon king Kinwulf gave land here¬
abouts to the church of Sherborn, for the boiling of fait
there to fupply its neceffities. At this place the duke
of Monmouth landed in 1685. A few years ago above
2000I. worth of gold and filver coin of Char. I. and II.
were dilcovered by fome labourers.
LYMINGTON, a borough town of Hamplhire in
England, 97 miles fouth-weft of London. It ftands
about a mile from the channel running between the
main land and the ifle of Wight j and has a harbour
far veffels of confiderable burden. The tide flows near
a mile above the town. It has a market on Satur¬
days, and tvro fairs in the year : and fends two mem¬
bers to parliament.
LYMPH, a fine colourlefs fluid, feparated in the
body from the mafs of blood, and contained in pecu¬
liar veffels called lymphatics. See Anatomy.
LYMPHiEA, were artificial caves or grottos a-
mongft the Romans, furnilhed with a great many
tubes, canals, and various hydraulic apparatus, through
which the water gufhed out upon the fpeftators un-
expeftedly whilft they were admiring the beautiful
arrangement of the {hell-work in the grotto.
LYMPH ATI, was a name given by the Romans
to fuch as were feized with madnefs. It is iuppofed
to be ufed for Nymphati, becaule the ancients imagined
that every perfon who had the misfortune to fee a
Nymph was inftantly ftruck with phrenzy. Lymphati
may indeed lignify “ madmen,1’ as derived from lym-
pha, “ water,” over which element the Nymphs were
thought to prefide : But it appears moft likely, that
diftradled people w^ere called lymphati, from the cir-
cumftance of madmen’s being affefted with the hydrC’-
phobia or dread of water after the bite of a mad dog ;
for this peculiarity, in cafes of canine madnefs, was
not unknown to the Remans.
LYNCEUS, in fabulous hiftory, one of the 50 fons
of iEgeus, married Hypermneftra, one of the 50 daugh¬
ters of Danaus. See Hypermnestra.
LynCEUS, in fabulous hiftory, one of the Argo¬
nauts, who went with Jafon in the expedition to ob¬
tain the golden fleece. He was of great ufe to the
Argonauts, by enabling them to avoid the fand banks
and rocks they found in their way. 1 he poets (ay, that
Lynctus had fo piercing a fight, that it could not only
penetrate to the bottom of the fea, but even to hell.
Some mythoiogifts fuppofe, that this table is taken
from Lynceus’s {kill in obferving the ftars, and diico-
vering the mines of gold and filver concealed in the
earth.
JLYNCURIUM, a ftone thought to be the fame
with

Ly»curius, witli tlie tourmalin. The name is derived from Avy|,
lapis. u lynx,” and “ urine.”
LYNCUR1US lapis, a (tone capable ot produ¬
cing mufhrooms. .
in the Ephemerides of the Curious, we find men¬
tion made of a ftone, fo called by Dr John George
Wolckamerus, who faw one in Italy, wdiich never
ceafes to produce in a few days mulhrooms of an
excellent flavour by the moft Ample and eafy pro-
cefs imaginable. “ It is (fays he) of the bignefs ot
an ox’s head, rough and uneven on its furtace, and
on which alfo are perceived fome clefts and crevices.
It is black in fome parts, and in others of a lighter
and grayilh colour. Internally it is porous, and near¬
ly of the nature of the pumice-Hone, but much. hea¬
vier 5 and it contains a fmall piece of flint, which is
fo incorporated with it as to appear to have been form¬
ed at the fame time the ftone itfelf received its form.
This gives room to judge, that thofe ftones have been
produced by a fat and vifeid juice, which has the pro¬
perty of indurating whatever matter it filtrates, into.
The ftone here fpoken of, wdien it has been lightly
covered with earth, and fprinkled with warm .wjater,
produces mufhrooms of an exquifite flavour, which are
ufually round, fometimes oval, and whofe borders, by
their inflexions and different curvities, reprefent in fome
meafure human ears. The principal colour, of thefe
mufhrooms is fometimes yellowifh, and fometimes of a
bright purple; but they are always diffeminated with
different fpots, of a deep orange colour, or red brown ;
and when thefe fpots are recent, and ftill in full bloom,
they produce a very agreeable effeft to the fight. But
what appears admirable is, that the part of the ftalk
which remains adhering to the ftone, when the mufti-
room has been feparated from it, grows gradually hard,
and petrifies in time, fo that it feems that this fungites
reftores to the ftone the nutritive juice it received from
it, and that it thus contributes to its increafe.” John
Baptift Porta pretends, that this ftone is found in fe-
veral parts of Italy *, and that it is not only to be met
with at Naples, taken out of Mount Vefuvius, but al¬
fo on Mount Pantherico, in the principality of Arel-
lino ; on Mount Garganus, in Apulia ; and on the
fummits.of fome other very high mountains. He adds,
that the mufhrooms which grow on thofe forts of ftones,
and are ufually called fungi lyncuru, have the property
of diffolving and breaking the ftone of the kidneys and
bladder ; and that, for this purpofe, nothing more is
required than to dry them in the fhade, and being re¬
duced to powder, to make the patient, Efting, take
a fufficient quantity of this powder in a glafs of white
wine, which will fo cleanfe the excretory du6ts of the
urine, that no Hones will ever after be collected in
them. As to the form of thofe mufhrooms, their root
is liony, uneven, divided according to its longitudinal
direftion, and compofed of fibres as fine as hairs, in¬
terwoven one with another. Their form, on firft Ihoot-
ing out, •refembles a fmall bladder, fcarce then larger
than the bud of a vine \ and if in this ftate they are
fqueezed between the fingers, an aqueous fubacid li¬
quor iffues out. When they are at their full growth,
their pedicle is of a fingers length, larger at top than
at bottom, and becomes infenfibly flenderer in propor¬
tion as it is nearer the earth, Thefe muftirooms are
alfo formed in an umbella, and variegated with an in¬
finity of little fpecks fituated very near one another. Lynn-regts.
They are fmooth and even on the upper part, but un-' v""~"
derneath leafy like the common muftirooms. Their
tafte is likewife very agreeable, and the fick are not
debarred eating of them when they have been dreffed in
a proper manner. Curiofity having prompted fome
naturalifts and phyficians to fubmit thefe ftones to a
chemical analyiis, in order to be more competent judges
of the ufes they might be put to in medicine, there
firft came forth, by diftillation, an infipid water, and
afterveards a fpirituous liquor. The retort having been
heated to a certain point, there arofe an oil, which had
nearly the fmell and tafte of that of guaiacum j and a
very acrid fait w'as extrafted from the allies.
LYNN-kegis, a town of Norfolk, in England,
diftant 98 miles from London. It is a handfome,
large, well-built place, and fends two members to par¬
liament. It was a borough by prefeription in 1298.
King John, on account of its adherence to him againft
the barons, made it a free^ borough, with large pri¬
vileges. He appointed it a provoit, and gave it a
large filver cup of 73 ounces doubly gilt and enamel¬
led, and a large filver fword that is carried before the
mayor; though this laft, according to fome, is Hen¬
ry VIII.’s fword, which he gave to the town when it
came into his hands by exchange with the bilhop of
Norwich -y after which it was called King’s Lynn,
whereas before it was Biftiop’s Lynn. Henry III. made
it a mayor town, for its ferving him againft the barons.
It has had 15 royal charters ; and is governed by a
mayor, high-fteward, under lie ward, recorder, 12 aider-
men, and 18 common-council men. It has two churches,
befides St Nicholas, a chapel of eafe to St Margaret’s,
a Prefbyterian and a Quakers meeting-houfe, with a
bridewell or workhoufe, and feveral alms-houfes, and
a free fchool. In September 1741 the fpires of its
two churches were both blown down by a ftorm of
wind •, and that of St Margaret’s, which was 193 feet
in height, having1 beat in the body of the church, it
has been fince rebuilt, towards which King George II.
gave 1 cool, and the late earl of Orford, then Sir
Robert Walpole, 300I. This church was formerly
an abbey, and afterwards one of the largeft pariih-
churches in England. The town-houfe, called Tri¬
nity-hall, is a noble old fabric ; and fo is the Exchange,
which is of free-ftone, with two orders of columns.
St Nicholas’s chapel is very ancient, and reckoned
one of the faireft and largeft of the kind in England.
It has a bell-tower of free-ftone, and an octagonal
fpire over it, both which together are 170 feet from
the ground. There is a library in it that was credited
by fubfeription •, and there is another at St Marga¬
ret’s. Here have been formerly feveral monalteries $
but the only fabric remaining that belongs to any re¬
ligious order is the Gray-friars fteeple, a noted fea-
mark. The fituation of this town, near the fall of
the Oufe into the fea, after having received feveral
other rivers, of which fome are navigable, gives it an
opportunity of extending its trade into eight different
counties j by which many confiderable cities and
towns, viz. Peterborough, Ely, Stamford, Bedford,
St Ives, Huntingdon, St Neot’s, Northampton, Cam¬
bridge, St Edmundfbury, and the north parts of Bucks,
as well as the inland parts of Norfolk and Suffolk, are
fupplied with heavy goods, not only from our own
N n 2 produce.
L Y N [2;
r.ynn-regis. produce, as coals and fait from NeweaSIe, but alfo of
v ^ merchandiie imported from abroad, efpecially wine ;
of which two articles, viz. coals and wine, this is the
greateft port for importation of any place on all the
eailern coaft of England j and thofe wherein the TLynn
merchants deal more largely than any town in England,
except London, Briltol, and N-wealtle. In return
for this, Lynn receives back all the corn which the
counties juft mentioned produce, for exportation ; and
therefore fends more ot it abroad than any port except
Hull. Ihe foreign trade of the merchants here, is
very confiderable, efpecially to Holland, Norway, and
the Baltic, and alio to Spain and Portugal; and for¬
merly they drove a good trade to France, till it was
turned off, by treaties on one hand, and by prohibi¬
tions, high duties, &c. on the other, to Spain and
Portugal. Ihe harbour is fafe when (hips are in it,
but difficult to enter by reafon of the many flats asid
fhoals in the paffage ; which, howrever, are well buoyed,
and good pilots are always4ready. The town confifts of
about 2400 houfes j and appears to have been very
ftrong, by the luins of the works demoliffied in the
civil wars. St Ann’s platform at the north end mounts
12 great guns, and commands all the {hips paffing near
the harbour : and towards the land, befides the wall,
there is a ditch. Four rivulets run through the town ;
and the tide of the Oufe, which is about as broad
here as the Thames at London bridge, rifes 20 feet
perpendicular. In the great market-place a ftatue
was erefted in 1686 to the honour of King James II.
There is another Ipacious market-place, adorned with
a ftatue of King William III. and a fine crofs with a
dome and gallery round it, fupported by 16 pillars.
Ihe market-hcule is of free-ftone, fupported by 16
columns, and is 70 feet high, erefled on four fteps, neat¬
ly adorned with flatues, &c. Every firlf Monday in the
month, the mayor, aldermen, preachers, &c. meet to
hear and determine all controverfies amicably, for pre¬
venting law-luits. This was firlf eftablilhed in 1 t;88, and
is called The Feajl of Reconciliation. The markets are
on Tuefdays and Saturdays j and it has two fairs;
one of which, beginning Feb. 14. lafts for a fortnight,
and is called Lynn mart j the other is a cheefe fair on
OH. 6. The adherence of this town to King John
and to Henry VIII. as above mentioned, are not the
only inftances of its loyalty to its fovereigns *, for, in
the late civil wars, it held out for King Charles I. and
iuftamed a formal fiege of above 18,000 men of the
parliament army for above three weeks; but, for
want of relief, was obliged to furrender, and fubmit
to the terms of paying 10s. a-head for every inhabi¬
tant, and a month’s pay to the loldiers, to fave the
town from plunder. There are more gentry, and con-
fequently more gaiety, in this town than in Yarmouth
or even Norwich ; there being fuch plenty of eatables
and drinkables, that Spelman fays, Ceres and Bacchus
feem to have ellabliffied their magazines at this place j
the eail fide abounding with corn, fheep, rabbits, hares,
&c. the weft fide with cheefe, butter, black cattle,
fwans, and the wild fowl common to mrrfhes, befides
the abundance of fea and river fifli ; fo that he thinks
there is no place in Great Britain, if in Europe, has
fuch a variety in fo fmall a compafs of ground. At
a fmall diftance from the town, Hands a mount, called
the Lady’s or Red Mount, which wTas once a chapel

dedicated to the Virgin Mary, which was a refting- Lynx
place for pilgrims on their way towards her convent II

where the greateft part of the imported wines is land- '
ed and put into large vaults, is a handfome fquare,

N0clviii. 16. ’
This office is of great antiquity and refpecl in Scot¬
land ; and although the precife time of its inftitution
is unknown, yet it muft have been as early as the in¬
troduction of armorial figures as hereditary marks of
gentility and diftinHion into this country, which was
in the I 2th century.. His regalia are, a crown of gold,
with a crimfon velvet cap, a gold taffel, and an ermine
lining : a velvet robe reaching to his feet, with the arms
of the kingdom embroidered thereon before and be¬
hind in the proper tindures j a triple row of gold chain
round his neck, w'ith an oval gold medal pendant there¬
to, on one fide of which is the royal bearing, and on
the other St Andrew with his crofs enamelled in pro¬
per colours, and a baton of gold enamelled green, pow¬
dered with the badges of the kingdom. The lord
lyon’s rank is fuperior to that of any other king of
arms, as he holds his office immediately from the fove-
reign by commiffion under the great feal 5 whereas the
kings of arms in England are deputies to the earl
marlhal, and aH under his authority. Formerly Scot¬
land was divided into two provinces, the one on the
north and the other on the louth fide of Forth ; and
thefe provinces were under the management of two de¬
puties appointed by the lord lyon, to fuperintend the
execution of all the bufinefs of his office. Before the
Revolution, the lord lyon, at his admiffion into office,
was moft folemnly crowmed by the fovereign or his
commitfioner, in prefence of the nobility, the officers
of ftate, and other great men, after a fuitable fermon
preached in the royal chapel ; and his crown wTas of
the fame form with the imperial crown of the king¬
dom. On folemn occafions he wears the regalia above
deferibed ; at all other times he wears the oval gold
medal or badge on his bread, fufpended by a broad
green ribbon. He has the abfolute difpofal of all the
offices in his owm court, and of the heralds and pur-
fuivants places. The meffengers at arms throughout
Scotland are alfo created by him, and are amenable to
his jurifdiflion. And the powTers veiled in him by
his commiffion are the fame with thofe of the fovereign
in all matters relative to the marks of gentilitv.
LYONET, Peter, an ingenious na’turalift, and
member of feveral learned focieties, was born at Maef-
tricht, and was dt feended from a very ancient and re-
fpeHable family of Lorrain. He had fcarcely attained
his feventh year before he difplayed an uncommon
ftrength and agility in all bodily exercifes 5 but he was
not lefs diligent in the improvement of his mind. Be¬
ing placed at the Latin fchool, he learned chronology,
and exercifed himfelf in Latin, Greek, and French
poetry, as alfo in Hebrew, logic, and the Carteiian
phyfics. He was particularly fond of the ftudy of lan-
guagesj
L Y O [ 285 ] L Y O
lyonet. guages, whereof he underftood no lefs than nine, li-
ving and dead. Having entered the univerlity of Ley¬
den, he ftudied the Newtonian philofophy, geometry,
algebra, &c. •, but his father (who was a clergyman),
defiring he fhould attach himfelf to divinity, he reluc¬
tantly abandoned the former ftudies, as his paffion for
them was not eafily to be overcome. He at the fame
time applied himfelf to anatomy, and alfo to mufic and
drawing. He began afterwards to pra£!ife fculpture :
and performed fieveral pieces in wood, fome of which
are preferved, and have been greatly admired by the
artifts. After this, he betook himfelf to drawing
portraits of his friends from life ; rvberein, after three
or four months practice, he became a great proficient.
Having attained the degree of candidate in divinity,
he refolved to ftudy law, to which he applied him¬
felf with fo much zeal, that he was promoted at the
end of the firft year. Arrived at the Hague, he un¬
dertook the (ludy of decyphering ; and became fecre-
tary of the cyphers, tranllator of the Latin and French
languages, and patent-mafler to their High Mighti-
neffes. Meanwhile, having taken a Itrong liking to
the ftudy of infetfts, he undertook an hiftorical de-
fcription of fuch as are found about the Hague, and
to that end collected materials for feveral volumes ; and
having invented a method of drawing adapted thereto,
he enriched this work with a great number of plates,
univerfally admired by all the connoiffeurs who had
feen them. In the year 1724 was printed at the
Hague a French tranflation of a German work, the
4 Theology of Infedls,’ by Mr Lefler. Love of truth
engaged Mr Lyonet to defer the publication of his a-
bove-mentioned defcription, and to make fome obfer-
vations on that work, to which he has added two mod:
beautiful plates, engraved from his deiigns. This per¬
formance caufed his merit to be univerfally known and
admired. The celebrated M. de Reaumur had the
above tranflation reprinted at Paris, not fo much on
account of the work itfelf as of Mr Lyonet’s obfer-
vations ; and beftowed on it, as did alfo many other
authors, the higheft encomiums. He afterwards exe¬
cuted drawings of the freih water polypus for Mr
Trembley’s beautiful wmrk, 1744. The ingenious
Wandelaar had engraved the firft: five plates •, when Mr
Lyonet, w7ho had never witnefled this operation, con¬
cerned at the difficulties he experienced in getting the
remaining eight finilhed in the fuperior ftyle he requir¬
ed, refolved to perform the talk himfelf. He’ ac¬
cordingly took a lelfon of one hour of Mr Wandelaar,
engraved three or four fmall plates, and immediately
began upon the work himfelf, which he performed in
fuch a manner as drew on him the higheft: degree of
praife, both from Mr Trembley and from many
other artifts, particularly the celebrated Van Gool j
who declared that the performance aftonilhed not
only the amateurs, but alfo the moft experienced
artifts. In ^748 he was chofen member of the Royal
Society of London. In 1749 he began (by mere
chance) his amazing colleblion of horns and fhells,
which, according to the univerfal teftimony of all tra-
vellers and amateurs who have vifited it, is at prefent
the moft beautiful, and certainly one of the moft valu¬
able, in Europe. In 1753 he became member of the
newly-eftablilhed Dutch Society of Sciences at Haer-
1cm; and in I757> after the celebrated M. le Cat, Lyouet
profeflor in anatomy and furgery, and member of al- H
moft all the principal focieties in Eurnpe, had feen ^^Lns'
Mr Lyonet’s incomparable Traite Anatomique de la Che¬
nille qui range le Bois de Saule, with the drarvings be¬
longing to it (which work was afterwards publiihed),
he was ele&ed member of the Royal Academy of Sci¬
ences of Rome, wffiereof M. le Cat was perpetual fe-
cretary. After the publication of this treatife, he be¬
came, in 1760, member of the Royal Academy of
Sciences of Berlin; in 1761, of the Imperial Acade¬
my of Naturalifts ; and, in 1762, of the Imperial Aca¬
demy of Sciences at St Peterfburgh. In order to en¬
able fuch as might be defirous of following him in his
intricate and moft aftoniffilng difcoveries xefpedling the
ftrudfure of this animal, Mr Lyonet publiihed, in the
rI ranlactions of the Dutch Society of Sciences at Haer-
lem, a defcription and a plate (as he alfo afterwards did
in French at the beginning of his Traite Anatomique') of
the inftrument and tools he had invented for the pur-
pofe of dilTe&ion, and likewife of the method he ufed
to afeertain the degree of ttrength of his magnifying
glafles. Notwithftanding all this labour, which was
confiderably increafcd by the extenfive correfpondence
which he for many years carried on with feveral learn¬
ed and refpectable perfonages, he ftill found means to
fet apart a large proportion of his time (as he himftlf
mentions it in his preface) for the immediate fervice
of his country ; but was not fortunate enough (as ap¬
pears by his writings) to get any other recompenfe
for his exertions than forrow and difappointment.—
During the laft fifteen or twenty years of his life, Mr
Lyonet added to the valuable treaiure he had already
collected of natural curiofities, a moft fuperb cabinet
of paintings, confifting of more than 560 performances;
among which are many of the moft eminent works of
the firft Dutch mailers. He did this with a view to
procure himfelf fome amufement during the latter part
of his life, when old age and infirmities muft weaken
his powers, and fet bounds to his activity. He had
always indeed accuftomed himfelf to employment, in-
fomuch that he has written fome pieces of Dutch poe¬
try ; and this difpofition remained with him , till with¬
in a fortnight of his death, when he was attacked with
an inflammation in his breaft, which, though apparent¬
ly cured, was, in the end, the caufe of his diffolution.
He died at the Hague in January 1789, aged 83 years,
leaving behind him a moft eftimable character. ’
LYONOIS, a large province of France; bound¬
ed on the north by Burgundy; on the eaft, by Dau-

the louth, by Vivarais and Velay ; and on the weft by-
Auvergne and a fmall part of Bourbonnois. It com¬
prehends Lower Lyonois, Beaujolois, and Forez ;
and it produces corn, wine, fruits, and more efpeci-
ally excellent chefnuts. The principal rivers are the
Saone, the Rhone, and the Loire. Lyons is the ca¬

LYONS, a large, rich, handfome, ancient, and fa-
mous town of France, being the moft confiderable in
the kingdom, next to Paris, with an archbifhop’s fee,
an academy of fciences and belles lettres, and an aca¬
demy of arts and fciences fettled here in 1736. It is
feated in the centre of Europe,, on the confluence of

ferves as a bulwark againft the north winds, which of¬
ten blow here with great violence. It contains about
I 50.000 inhabitants j and the houfes, in general, are
high and well built. It has fix gates, and as many
fuburbs. The town-houfe, the arfenal, the amphi¬
theatre built by the ancient Romans, the hofpital, and
the numerous palaces, are worthy of a traveller’s at¬
tention. The cathedral is a fuperb ftruflure, and the
canons that compofe the chapter are all perfons of di-

extended through Europe. It derives vaft advantages
from the rivers near it ; and is fituated in E. Long. 4.

LYRA, a fpecies of filh. See Callyonimus, Ich¬
thyology Index.
Lyra, in Jljlronomy, a conftellation in the north¬
ern hemifphere. The number of its ftars, in Pto¬
lemy’s catalogue, is ten ; in Tycho’s eleven 5 in Heve-
lius’s feventeen 5 and in the Britannic catalogue twen¬
ty one.
LYRE, a mufical inftrument of the ftringed kind,
much ufed by the ancients.
Concerning the number of firings with which this in¬
ftrument w’as furnilhed, there is great controverfy. Some
aflert it to be only three 5 and that the founds of the
twTo remote were acute, and that of the intermediate
one a mean between thofe two extremes *, that Mercu¬
ry, the inventor, refembled thofe three chords to as ma¬
ny feafons of the year, which were all that the Greeks
reckoned, namely, fummer, winter, and fpring: af-
figning the acute to the firft, the grave to the fecond,
and the mean to the third. *
Others affert that the lyre had four firings 5 that the
interval between the firft and the fourth was an oftave 5
that the fecond w^as a fourth from the firft, and the fourth
the fame diftance from the third, and that from the fe¬
cond to the third was a tone.
Another clafs of writers contend that the lyre of
Mercury had feven firings. Nicomachus, a follower of
Pythagoras, and the chief of them, gives the follow¬
ing account of the matter : “ The lyre made of the
ft]ell was invented by Mercury 5 and the knowledge of
it, as it w-as conftrutted by him of feven firings, was
tranfmitted to Orpheus : Orpheus taught the ufe of it
to Thamyris and Linus; the latter of whom taught it
to Hercules, who communicated it to Amphion the
Theban, who built the feven gates of Thebes to the fe¬
ven firings of the lyrel” The fame author proceeds
to relate, “ That Orpheus was afterwards killed by the
Thracian women 5 and that they are reported to have
call his lyre into the fea, which was afterwards thrown
up at Antiffa, a city of Lefbos: that certain fifhers
finding it, they brought it to Terpander, who^ carried
it into Egypt, exquifitely improved, and, ftiowing it to
the Egyptian priefis, affumed to himfelf the honour of
its invention.”
This difference among authors feem to have arifen
from their confounding together the Egyptian and^ the
Grecian Mercuries.—The invention of the primitive
lyre with three firings was due to the firft Egyptian
Hermes, as mentioned under that art:cle.— The lyre Lyre,
attributed to the Grecian Mercury is defcribed by al- " *
moil all the poets to be an initrument of feven firings f.
Vincenzio Galilei has colledled the various opinions oi t 5ee
the feveral Greek writers who have mentioned the 'm-curI%
vention of the chelys or teftudo 5 and the late Mr
Spence has done the fame in a very circumftantial but
ludicrous manner. “ Horace talks of Mercury as a
wonderful mufician, and reprefents him with a lyre.
There is a ridiculous old legend relating to this inven¬
tion, which informs us, that Mercury, after Healing
fome bulls from Apollo, retired to a fecret grotto,
which he ufed to frequent, at the foot of a mountain
in Arcadia. Juft as he was going in, he found a tor-
toife feeding at the entrance of his cave : he killed the
poor creature, and perhaps ate the fleih of it. As he
was diverting himfelf with the (hell, he was mightily
plealed with the noife it gave from its concave figure.
He had poflibly been cunning enough to find out, that
a thong pulled firait and faftened at each end, when
firuck with the finger, made a fort of mufical found.
However that was, he went immediately to work, and
cut feveral thongs out of the bides he had lately
ftolen, and faftened them as tight as he could to the
fhell of this tortoife 5 and, in playing with them, made
a new kind of mufic with them to divert himfelf in his
retreat.” This, confidered only as an account of the
firft: invention of the lyre, is not altogether fo unna¬
tural.
The moft ancient reprefentations of this infirument
agree very well with the account of its invention : the
lyre, in particular on the old celeftial globes, was re-
prefented as made of one entire (hell of a tortoife 5 and
that of Amphion in the celebrated group of the Dirce or
Toro, in the Farnefe palace at Rome, which is of Greek
fculpture, and very high antiquity, is figured in the fame
manner.
There have, howrever, been many other claimants to
the feven-ftringed lyre. For though Mercury invent¬
ed this inftrument in the manner already related, it is
faid he afterwards gave it to Apollo, who was the firfl:
that played upon it with method, and made it the con-
ftant companion of poetry. According to Homer’s
account of this tranfa&ion, in his hymn to Mercury,
it was given by that god to Apollo, as a peace-offering
and indemnification for the oxen which he had ftolen
from him :
To Phoebus Maia’s fon prefents the lyre,
A gift intended to appeafe his ire.
The god receives it gladly, and effays
The novel infirument a thoufand ways ;
With dext’rous Ikill the ple&rum wields 5 and fings
With voice accordant to the trembling firings,
Such ftrains as gods and men approv’d, from whence
The fweet alliance fprung of found and fenfe.
Diodorus informs us, that Apollo foon repenting of
the cruelty with wliich he had treated Marfyas in con-
fequence of their mufical conteft, broke the firings of
the lyre, and by that means put a flop for a time to any
further progrefs in the praftice of that new inftrument.
“ The Mufes (adds he) afterwards added to this in¬
ftrument the firing called mcfe; Linus, that of hchanos;
1
L Y R [ 287 ]
Lyre, and Orpheus and Thamyris, thofe firings which are
named hypate and parJnjpate (a).
-Again, Many ancient and refp&able authors tell us,
that, before the time of Terpander, the Grecian lyre
had only four firings *, and, if we may believe Suidas,
it remained in this ftate 856 years, from the time of
Amphion, till Terpander added to it three new firings,
which extended the mufical fcale to a heptachord, or
feventh, and fupplied the player with two conjoint te-
trachords. It was about 150 years after this period,
that Pythagoras is laid to have added an eighth firing
to the lyre, in order to complete the o&ave, which con-
fifted of two disjoint tetrachords.
Boetius gives a different hiftory of the fcale, and
tells us, that the fyffem did not long remain in fuch
narrow limits as a tetrachord. Choraebus, the fon of
Athis, or Atys, king of Lydia, added a fifth firing •,
Hyagnis, a ffxth •, Terpander, a feventh *, and at length
Lychaon of Samos, an eighth. But all thefe accounts
are irreconcilable with Homer’s hymn to Mercury,
where the chelys, or teftudo, the invention of which he
afcribes to that god, is faid to have had feven firings.
There are many claimants among the muficians of an¬
cient Greece to the firings that were afterwards added
to thefe, by which the fcale, in the time of Arittoxenus,
was extended to two odlaves. Athenaeus, more than
once, fpeaks of the nine-ffringed inftrumerit 5 and Ion
of Chios, a tragic and lyric poet and philofopher, who
firfi recited his pieces in the 8 2d Olympiad, 452 B. C.
mentions, in fome verfes quoted by Euclid, the ten-
ftringed lyre ; a proof that the third conjoint tetrachord
w'as added to the fcale in his time, which was about 50
years after Pythagoras is fuppofed to have conftruiffed
the o&achord.
The different claimants among the Greeks to the
fame muffcal difcoveries, only prove that mufic was cul¬
tivated in different countries, and that the inhabitants
of each country invented and improved their own in-
ftruments, fome of which happening to refemble thofe
of other parts of Greece, rendered it difficult for hifto-
rians to avoid attributing the fame invention to differ¬
ent perfons. Thus the Angle flute was given to Mi¬
nerva and to Marfyas ■, the fyrinx or fiftula, to Pan
and to Cybele and the lyre or cithara, to Mercury,
Apollo, Amphion, Linus, and Orpheus. Indeed, the
mere addition of a firing or two to an inftrument with¬
out a neck, was fo obvious and eafy, that it is fcarce
L Y R
poffible not to conceive many people to have done it at i ^Je’_
the fame time.
With refpeft to the form of the ancient lyre, as little
agreement is to be found among authors as about the
number of firings. The belt evidences concerning it,
are the reprefentations of that inftrument in the hands of
ancient ftatues, bas-reliefs, &c. See Plate CCXCA 111.

3. The Abyffinian teftudo, or lyre in ufe at prefent
in the province of Tigre, from a drawing of Mr Bruce,
communicated to Dr Burney. “ This inftrument (fays
he) has fometimes five, fometimes fix, but molt fre¬
quently feven firings, made of the thongs of raw Iheep
or goat fkins, cut extremely fine, and twifted 5 they
rot foon, are very fubjeft to break in dry weather*
and have fcarce any found in wet. From the idea,
however, of this inftrument being to accompany and fuf-
tain a voice, one would think that it was better mounted
formerly. “ The Abyffinians have a tradition, that the
fiftrum, lyre, and tambourine, were brought from Egypt
into Ethiopia, by Thot, in the very firft ages of the
world. The flute, kettle-drum, and trumpet, they fay,
were brought from Paleftine, with Menelek, the Ion of
their queen of Saba by Solomon, who was their firfi:
Jew'ifir king,
“ The lyre in Amharic is called beg, ‘ the fheep ;
in Ethiopic it is called mejinko; the verb finho fignifies
to ftrike firings wdth the fingers : no ple&rum is ever
ufed in Abyffinia j fo that mefinko, being literally in¬
terpreted, will fignify the ‘ ftringed inftrument played
upon with the fingers.’
“ The Aides which conftitute the frame of the lyre,
were anciently compofed of the horns of an animal of the
goat kind, called aga%en, about the fize of a fmall cow,
(a) It has been already related, that the lyre invented by the Egyptian Mercury had but three firings 5 and,
by putting tbefe two circumftances together, Dr Burney obferves, we may perhaps acquire fome knowledge of the
progrefs of mufic, or, at leaft, of the extenfion of its fcale, in the higheft antiquity.
Mefe, in the Greek mufic, is the fourth found of the fecond tetrachord of the great fyftem, and firft tetrachord
invented by the ancients, anfwering to our A, on the fifth line in the bafe.. If this found then was added to the
former three, it proves two important points 5 firft, that the moft ancient tetrachord was that from E in tfcie bafe
to A •, and that the three original firings in the Mercurian and Apollonian lyre were tuned E, F, G, which the
Greeks called Hypate Mefon, Parhypate Mefon, Mefon Diatoms. The addition therefore of Mefe to thefe, com¬
pleted the firfi and mod: ancient tetrachord, E, F, G, A.
The firing /ichanos, then, being added to thefe, and anfwering to our D on the third line in the bafe, ex¬
tended the compafs downwards, and gave the ancient lyre a regular feries of five founds in the Dorian mode,
the moft ancient of all the Greek modes; and the two firings call Hypate and Parhypate, correfponding
W’ith our B and C in the bafe, completed the heptachord, or feven founds, B, C, D, E, F, G, A, a com¬

and common in the province of Tigre. I have feen feve-
ral of thefe inftruments very elegantly made of fuch
horns, which nature feems to have Ihaped on purpole.
Some of the horns of an African fpecies of this animal
may be feen in M. Buffon’s hifiory of the king of
kranee’s caoinet. I hey are bent, and lefs regular than
the Abyffinian 5 but after fire-arms became common in
the province of Tigre, and the woods were cut down,
this animal being more fcarce, the lyre has been made of
a light red wood ; however, it is always cut into a fpiral
twilled form, in imitation of the ancient materials of
whicn the lyre was compofed. The drawing I fend
you was one of thefe inflruments made of wood.
“ ^le kingdom of Tigre, which is the largeft and
moll populous province of Abyfilnia, and was during
many ages the feat of the court, was the firft which
received letters, and civil religious government ; it
extended once to the Red fea : various reafons and
revolutions have obliged the inhabitants to refign their
fea coail to different barbarous nations, Pagan and Ma¬
hometan : while they were poffeffed of it, they fay
that the Red lea furnifiled them with tortoife-lhells,
of which they made the bellies of their lyres, as the
Egyptians did formerly, according to Apollodorus
and Lucian ; but having now loft that refource, they
have adopted in its place a particular fpecies of gourd,
or pumpkin, very hard and thin in the bark, ftill imi¬
tating with the knife the fquares, compartments, and
figure of the ftiell of the tortoife.
“ The lyre is generally from three feet to three
feet fix inches high j that is, from a line drawn through
the point of the horns, to the lower part of the bafe of
the founding board. It is exceedingly light, and cafy
of carriage, as an inftrument Ihould naturally be in fo
rugged and mountainous a country.
“ When we confider the parts which compofe this
lyre, we cannot deny it the earlieft antiquity. Man in
his firft ftate was a hunter and a fiflier, and the oldeft
inftrument was that which partakes moft of that ftate.
The lyre, compofed of two principal pieces, owes the
one to horns of an animal, the other to the Ihell of
a filh.
“.It is probable, that the lyre continued with the
Ethiopians in this rude ftate as long as they confined
themfelves to their rainy, fteep, and rugged mountains 5
and afterwards, when many of them defeended along
the Nile into Egypt, its portability would recommend it
in the extreme heats and wearinefs of their way. Up¬
on their arrival in Egypt, they took up their habita¬
tion in caves, in the lides of mountains, which are in¬
habited to this day. Even in thefe circumftances, an
inftrument larger than the lyre muft have been in¬
convenient and liable to accidents in thofe caverns; but
when thefe people increafed in numbers and courage,
they ventured down into the plain, and built Thebes.
Being now at their eafe, and in a fine climate, all na¬
ture fmiling around them, mufic and other arts were
cultivated and refined, and the imperfect lyre was ex¬
tended into an inftrument of double its compafs and
volume. -The fize of the harp cotdd be now no long-
*r an objeflion ; the Nile carried the inhabitants every¬
where eafiily, and without effort; and we may naturally
fuppofe in the fine evenings of that country, that the
Nile was the favourite feene upon which this inftm-
L Y R
ment wras practifed ; at leaft the fphinx and lotus upon
its head, feem to hint that it was fomewray connected
with the overflowings of that river.” See Harp.
4. An Etrufcan lyre, with feven firings, in the col-
leflion of Etrufcan, Greek and Roman antiquities,
publilhed from the cabinet of the Hon. Sir William
Hamilton, Vol I. Naples 1766. Plate CIX. With re-
fpeft to this inftrument, it is worthy of obfervation,
that though the vafe upon which it is reprefented is of
fuch indifputable and remote antiquity, the tail-piece
briage, belly, and found-holes, have a very modern ap¬
pearance, and manifeft a knowledge in the conftruflion
of mufical inftruments among the Etrufcans fuperior to
that of the Greeks and Romans in much latter times.
1 he lower part of the inftrument has much the appear¬
ance of an old bals-viol, and it is not difficult to difi-
cover in it more than the embryo of the whole violin
family. I he firings lie round, as if intended to be
played on with a bow ; and even the crofs lines on the
tail-piece are fuch as we frequently fee on the tail¬
pieces of old viols.
5- 'I"*16 Tripodian lyre of Pythagoras the Zacyn-
thian, from a bas-relief in the Maffei palace at Rome
reprefenting the whole choir of the mufes. Atheneeus
gives the following account of this extraordinary in¬
ftrument, Lib. XIV. cap. xv. p. 637. Many ancient
inftruments are recorded (fays Artemon), of which
we have fo little knowledge, that we can hardly be
certain of their exiftence ; fuch as the tripod of Py¬
thagoras the Zacynthian, which, on account of its
difficulty, continued in ufe but a fhort time. It
refembled in form the Delphic tripod, whence it
had its name. The legs were equidiftant, and fixed
upon a moveable bafe that was turned by the foot
of the player : the firings were placed between the
legs of the ftool; the vafe at the top ferved for the
purpofe of a found-board, and the firings of the three
fides of the inftrument wrere tuned to three different
modes, the Doric, Lydian, and Phrygian, fhe per¬
former fat on a chair made on purpofe : flriking the
firings with the fingers of the left hand, and ufing the
ple&rum with the. right, at the fame time turning the
inftrument with his foot to whichever of the three
modes he pleafed : fo that by great pra&ice he was
enabled to change the modes with fuch velocity, that
thofe who did not fee him would imagine they heard
three difl'erent performers playing in three different
modes. After the death of this admirable mufician,
no other inftrument of the fame kind was ever con-
ftru6led.”

vernment there many years. When about 47 years
of age, he returned to Athens 5 whence, being after¬

ra. Upon his return, Thrafybulus wTould have had
him employed again in date matters; but this not tak¬

er of the great feal in the reign of Charles I. was emi¬
nent for his probity and his moderation at the com¬
mencement of that monarch’s difputes with his fubje&s.
Without forfeiting his fidelity to the king, he pre-
ferved the elteem of the parliament till 1644, when
he was made colonel of a regiment in the king’s army
at York. He died in 1645. Befides feveral of his
fpeeches which have been printed, he w-rote reports
in the common pleas and exchequer, printed at Lon¬
don in 1603, in folio ; feveral arguments and did
courfes, &c.
Lyttelton, George Lord, eldeft fon of Sir Thomas
Lyttelton, Bart, defcended from the great judge Lyt¬
telton, was born in 1700, at feven months; and the
midwfife fuppofing him to be dead, threw him carelefs-
ly into the cradle ; where, had not fome figns of life
been taken notice of by one of the attendants, he
might never have recovered. He received the elements
of his education at Eaton-fchool, where he fhow7ed an
early inclination to poetry. His paftorals and fome
other light pieces were originally written in that femi-
nary of learning ; from whence he was removed to the
univerfity of Oxford, where he purfued his claffical
fludies W'ith uncommon avidity, and iketched the plan
of his Perfian Letters; a w'ork which afterwards pro¬
cured him great reputation, not only from the elegance
of the language in which they were compofed, but
from the excellent obfervations they contained on the
manners of mankind.
In the year 1728, he fet out on the tour of Europe ;
and, on his arrival at Paris, accidentally became ac¬
quainted with the honourable Mr Poyntz, then our
minifter at the court of Verfailles ; who was fo ftruck
with the extraordinary capacity of our young travel¬
ler, that he invited him to his houfe, and employed
him in many political negotiations, which he execut¬
ed with great judgement and fidelity.
Mr Lyttelton’s conduft, while on his travels, w7as
a leffon of inftruftion to the red of his countrymen.
Inflead of lounging aw7ay his hours at the coffee-houfes
frequented by the Englilh, and adopting the fafhion-
able follies and vices of France and Italy, his time was
paffed alternately in his library and in the fociety of
men of rank and literature. In this early part of his
life, he wrote a poetical epifile to Dr Ayfcough, and
another to Mr Pope, which fhow fingular tafte and
corre&nefs.
After continuing a confiderable time at Paris with
Mr Poyntz, who, to ufe his own words, behaved like
a fecond father to him, he proceeded to Lyons and
Geneva; and from thence to Turin, where he was
honoured with great marks of friendihip by his Sardi¬
nian majefty. He then vifited Milan, Venice, Genoa,
and Rome, where he applied himfelf cloffly to the
ftudy of the fine arts ; and was, even in that celebrated
metropolis, allowed a perfeft judge of painting, fculp¬
ture, and archite&ure.

Lyttelton, refponded with Sir Themas, his father. Several of
his letters are yet remaining, and place his filial af¬
fection in a very diftinguilhed light. He foon after
returned to his native country, and was elefted re-
prefentative for the borough of Okehampton in De-
vonfhire j and behaved fo much to the fatisfa£lion
of his conftituents, that they feveral times re-ele&ed
him for the fame place without putting him to the
lead expence.
About this period, he received great marks of friend-
fhip from Frederic prince of Wales, father of his pre-
fent majefty j and was, in the year 1737, appointed
principal fecretary to his royal highnefs, and continued
in the drifted intimacy with him till the time of his
death. His attention to public bufinefs did not, how¬
ever, prevent him from exercifing Ins poetical talent.
A mod amiable young lady, Pv'Iifs Fortefcue, infpired
him wdth a paffion, which produced a number of little
pieces, remarkable for their tendernefs and elegance j
and he had a happy facility of driking out an extem¬
pore compliment, wThich obtained him no fmall (hare
of reputation. One evening being in company with
Lord Cobham and feveral of the nobility at Stowe,
his lordihip mentioned his defign of putting up a bud
of Lady Suffolk in his beautiful gardens ; and, turning
to Mr Lyttelton, faid, “ George, you mud furnidi
me with a motto for it.” “ 1 will, my lord,” an-
fwered Mr Lyttelton j and direftly produced the fol¬
lowing couplet :
Her wit and beauty for a court were made,
But truth and goodnefs fit her for a lhade.
When Mr Pitt, the late earl of Chatham, lod his
commillion in the guards, in confequence of his fpirit-
ed behaviour in parliament, Mr Lyttelton was in wait¬
ing at Lelceder-houfe, and, on hearing the circum-
dance, immediately wrote thefe lines :
Long had thy virtue mark’d thee out for fame,
Far, far fuperior to a cornet’s name 5
This generous Walpole faw, and griev’d to find
So mean a pod difgrace that noble mind •,
The fervile dandard from thy free-born hand
He took, and bade thee lead the patriot band.
In the year 1742, he married Lucy, the daughter
of Hugh Fortefcue, Efq. of Filleigh in the county
of Devon, the lady above-mentioned, whofe exemplary
conduft, and uniform praftice of religion and virtue,
edablidied his conjugal happinefs upon the mod folid
balls.
In 1744, he was appointed one of the lords com-
miffioners of the treafury •, and, during his continuance
in that dation, condantly exerted his influence in re¬
warding merit and ability. He was the friend and
patron of the late Henry Fielding, James Thomfon
author of the Seafons, Mr Mallet, Dr Young, Mr
Hammond, Mr Wed, Mr Pope, and Voltaire. On
the death of Thomfon, who left his affairs in a very
embarraffed condition, Mr Lyttelton took that poet’s
fider under his proteftion. He revifed the tragedy of
Coriolanus, which that writer had not put the lad
hand toy and brought it out at the theatre-royal,
Covent-garden, with a prologue of his own writing,
In which he fo affeftingly lamented the lofs of that
delightful bard, that ngt only Mr Quin, who fpoke
the lines, but almod the whole audience, fpontaneoufly Lyttelton,
burd into ears. L“ v**-—
In the beginning of the year 1746, his felicity was
interrupted by the lofs of his wife, who died in the
29th year of her age ; leaving him one fon, Thomas,
the late Lord Lyttelton ; and a daughter, Lucy, w-ho
fome time fince married Lord Vifcount Valentia. The
remains of his amiable lady were depofited at Over-
Arley in Worceflerfliire j and an elegant monument
was erefted to her memory in the church of Hagley,
which contains the following infeription written by
her hudrand :
Made to engage all hearts, and charm all eyes :
Tho’ meek, magnanimous ; tho’ witty, wife j
Polite, as all her life in courts had been 5
Yet good, as die the world had never feen ?
The noble fire of an exalted mind,
With gentled female teadernefs combin’d.
Her fpeech was the melodious voice of love,
Her fong the warbling of the vernal grove.
Her eloquence was fweeter than her fong,
Soft as her heart, and as her reafon drong.
Her form each beauty of her mind exprefs’d,
Her mind was virtue by the Graces drefs’d.
Befides thefe beautiful lines, Mr Lyttelton wrote a
monody on the death of his lady, which will be re¬
membered while conjugal affeftion and a tade for
poetry exifl in this country.
His maderly obfervations on the converfion and

religion, w7hich might be drawn from the prophecies
of the Old Tedament, from the neceffary connec¬
tion it has with the whole fyfiem of the Jewifli
religion, from the miracles of Chrid, and from the
evidence given of his refurreftion by all the other
apoflles, be thought the converfion of St Paul alone,

In 1754, he refigned his office of lord of the trea¬
fury, and was made cofferer to his majedy’s houfe-
hold, and fworn of the privy-council : previous to
which, he married, a fecond time, Elizabeth daughter
of Field-marlhal Sir Robert Rich; whofe indifereet con¬
duft gave him great uneafinefs, and from whom he
was feparated, by mutual confent, a few years after his
marriage.
After being appointed chancellor and under trea-
furer of the court of exchequer, he was, by letters^

He was fuddenly feized with an inflammation of

MAAT, John. See Blankof.
MABILLON, John, a very learned writer of
France in the 17th century, was born at Perremonte,
on the frontiers of Champagne, in 1632. He was
educated in the univerfity of Rheims, and afterwards
entered into the abbey of the Benediftines of St Remy.
In the year 1663, he was appointed keeper of the
treafures and monuments of France at St Dennis : but Macaco
having unfortunately broke a looking glafs there, _Vjacfi.;ari3
which was pretended to have belonged to Virgil, he
defired leave of his fuperiors to quit an employment
w’hich frequently obliged him to tell things he did not
believe. Next year he went to Paris ; and was very
ferviceable to Father d’Acheri, w7ho w7as defirous of
having fome young monk who could aflift him in com¬
piling his Spici/egium. This made him known. Soon
after, the congregation of St Maur having formed a
defign of publiihing new editions of the fathers, re-
vifed from the MSS. in the libraries of the Benedic¬
tines, Mabillon was charged with the edition of St
Bernard, which he prepared with extraordinary dili¬
gence. After that, he publiftied many other wmrks,
which are evidences of his vaft capacity and induftry.
In 1682, he was employed by Mr Colbert in examin¬
ing fome ancient titles relating to the royal family.
The year following he fent him into Germany, to
fearch the archives and libraries of the ancient abbeys,
for what was moft curious and proper to illuftrate the
hiftory of the church in general, and that of France
in particular. He has publiftied an account of this
journey. In 1685, he undertook another journey
into Italy, by order of the king of France ; and re¬
turned the year following with a very noble coliedlion.
He placed in the king’s library above 3000 volumes
of rare books, printed and in MSS. and compofed twa
volumes of the pieces which he had difeovered in that
country. He was highly efteemed for his virtues as
well as his learning.

MACARONI. See Folengio, and the next

MACARONIC, or Macaroniak, a kind of bur-
lefque poetry, confiding of a jumble of words of differ¬
ent languages, with words of the vulgar tongue La¬
tinized; and Latin w'ords modernized. Macaroni
among the Italians, as has been obferved by Ccelius
Rhodiginus, fignifies a coarfe c/owni/h man ; and be-
caufe this kind of poetry is patched out of feveral
languages, and full of extravagant words, &c. the
Italians, among whom it had its rife, gave it the name
of macaronian cr macaronic poetry. Others choofe
to derive it a macarombus, from macaroons, a kind of
confection made of meal not boulted, fweet almonds,
iugar, and the white of eggs, accounted a great
dainty^ among the countiy people in Italy ; which,
from tneir being compofed of various ingredients, oc-
eafioned this kind of poetry, which con fills of Latin,
Italian, Spanifh, French, Englifh, &c. to be called
by their name.
Example.—A bold fellow in the macaronic flyle,
fays,
Enjilavt omnes fcadrones et regimandos, &c.
Another example:
jtrchelos piftoliferos furiamque manantum,
Et grandem efmeutam qua: inopinum facia ruelle cji :
Toxinumque alto troub/antem corda clochero, &c.
Theoph. Folengius, a Benediftine monk of Mantua,
was the firil who invented, or at lead cultivated, this
kind of verfe. See Folengio.
The bell pieces of this kind are, the Baldus of Fo¬

Macassar Poifon, in Natural Hi/lory, called ippo in
the Macaffar and Malayan tongue, is the gum of a cer¬
tain tree, Aiming, brittle, black, and every way like
Hone pitch, growing in the ifland of Celebes, in the
South feas ; with which all the natives arm themfelves
in travel, having a long hollow trunk of a hard red
wood like bralil, accurately bored, and at one end is
fixed a large lance-blade of iron. Then they make a
fmall arrow, very ftraight, and fomewhat bigger than a
large wheaten draw': at one end they fix it into a
round piece of white, light, foft wood, like cork,
about the length of the little finger, juft fit for the
bore of the trunk, to pafs clear by the force of one’s
breath, and to fill it fo exaflly, that the air may net
pafs by, but again!! it, in order to carry it with the
greater force. At the other end they fix in it either
a fmall filh-toeth for that purpofe, or make a blade of
wood of the bignefs of the point of a lancet, about
three-quarters of an inch long, and making a little
notch in the end of the arrow, they flick it firm
therein, which they anoint with poifon. The poi-
fonous gum, when gathered, is put into hollow bam¬
boos or canes, flopped up very clofe, and thus brought
to Macaffar. When they fit it for ufe, they take a
piece of fmooth turtle-fliell, and a flick cut flat and
fmooth at the end : then they take green galangal root,
grate it, and with the addition of a little fair water,
prefs the juice into a clean china difli : then with a knife
feraping a little of the poifon upon the ftiell, dip the
end of the flick in the forementioned liquor, and with
this diflolve the poifon to the confiftence of a fyrup :
when this is done, they anoint the fifli-tooth or wooden
blade with the fame flick, and lay it in the fim, fo that
it may be baked hard. The pointed arrows thus pre--
pared, are put in hollow bamboos, clofe fliut, and in
this ftate they retain their virtue for a month.

MAC [ 293 J M A C
Maccabees, of the true religion, under the Egyptian or Syrian
Macbeth, kings. The firtl book of the Maccabees is an excel-
U^v“"—' lent hiilory, and comes neareft to the ftyle and manner
of the facred hidorians of any extant. It was written
originally in the Chaldee language, of the Jerufalem
dialecf, and was extant in this language in the time of
Jerome. From the Chaldee it was tranllated into
Greek, from the Greek into Latin. It is fuppofed to
have been written by John Hyrcanus the fon of Si¬
mon, who was prince and high pried of the Jews near
50 years, and began his government at the time where
this hiftory ends. It contains the hidory of 40 years,
from the reign of Antiochus Epiphanes to the death
of Simon the high pried : that is, from the year of
the world 382910 the year 3869*, 131 years before
Chrid. The i’econd book of the Maccabees begins
with two epidles fent from the Jews of Jerufalem to
the Jews of Egypt and Alexandria •, to exhort them
to obferve the fead of the dedication of the new altar
ere£Ied by Judas on his purifying the temple. The firft
was written in the 169th year of the era of the Se-
leucidae, i. e. before Chrid 144 5 and the fecond in the
188th year of the fame era, or 125 before Chrid j
and both appear to be fpurious. After thefe epidles
follows the preface of the author to his hidory, which
is an abridgement of a larger work, comoofed by one
Jafon, a Je w of Cyrene, wdro wrote in Greek the hi-
ftory of Judas Maccabeus and his brethren, and the
wars againd Antiochus Epiphanes, and Eupator his
fon. The fecond book does not by any means equal
the accuracy and excellency of the fird. It contains
a hidory of about 15 years, from the execution of
Heliodorus’s commidion, who was fent by Seleucus
to fetch away the treafures of the temple, to the vic¬
tory obtained by Judas Maccabeus over Nicanor $
that is, from the year of the world 3828, to the year
3843, 147 years before Chrid.
There are in the Polyglot Bibles, both of Paris and
London, Syriac verdons of both thefe books j but
they, as well as the Engliih verfions which w-e have
among the apocryphal writers in our Bibles, are de¬
rived from the Greek. There is alfo a third book of
the Maccabees, containing the hidory of the perfecu-
tion of Ptolemy Philopator againd the Jews in E-
gy pt, and their fufferings under it 5 which feems to have
been written by fome Alexandrian Jew in the Greek
language, not long after the time of Siracides. It is
in mod of the ancient manufcript copies of the Gieek
Septuagaint j particularly in the Alexandrian and Va¬
tican, but was never inferted into the vulgar Latin
verdon of the Bible, nor confequently into any of our
Englifh copies. Moreover, Jofephus’s hidory of the
martyrs that fuffered under Antiochus Epiphanes, is
found in fome manufcript Greek Bibles, under the
name of the fourth book of the Maccabees.
MACBETH, a Scots nobleman in the 1 ith cen¬

Not contented with curbing the king’s authority, he

heir into England, ufurped the crown. Siward earl
of Northumberland, whofe daughter Duncan had mar¬
ried, undertook, by the order of Edward the ConfetTor,
the proteftion of the fugitive prince.—He marched with
an army into Scotland j defeated and killed Macbeth ;
and redored Malcolm to the throne of his anceftors. Macbride.
Shakefpeare has made this t ran faction the fubjeit of one " v

MACBRIDE, D:i David, an eminent phyfician
and philofopher, was defcended from an ancient family
in the county of Galloway in Scotland. His grand¬
father, a clergyman, had fettled in Ireland about the
end of the lad century, as minider to a Prelbyterian
congregation at Belfad ; and his father, who followed
the fame line, was fettled at Bullymony in the county
of Antrim, w’here he married, and where our author
was bom in April 1726. After a proper fchool-educs-
tion, and having pafled fome time under the tuition
of an eminent furgeon in his native place, he was fent
to the univerfity of Glafgow. Having there completed
the ufual courfe of academical Iludies, he came to
Edinburgh for the further profecution of medical fci-
ence. After a diort day here, a war then prevailing
between France and Britain, he was induced to go on
board the navy in the dation of a furgeon’s mate. In
the fervice of his country he continued for feveral
years j and after difcharging for fome time the duties
of an adidant, he was raifed to the rank of furgeon.
In this dtuation, he fird turned his thoughts towards
the difcovery of a remedy for the fea-fcurvy. It was
not, however, at this period, that either chance or rea-
foning fuggeded to him the employment of an article
which has lince been attended with the mod beneficial
confequences. Here he had an opportunity only of ob-
ferving the fymptoms, of ftudying the nature, and of la¬
menting the confequences, of the difeafe.
The termination of the war by the peace of Aix-la-
Chapelle put a period to Dr Macbride’s employment
as a naval furgeon. He had now probably obtained
much medical knowledge in the fchool of experience ;
but he was fenfible that he had dill much to acquire
in that of fcience. An ardent keennefs to mingle in
atiive life had led him from the fchools of medicine at
an earlier period than could have been wiihed ; and an
earned defire to found his future pradtice in the bed
eRablidied principles led him back to them, when a
judgement, matured by years, and informed from the
observation of fadts, rendered him capable of hearing
teachers with greater advantage. He returned there¬
fore to Edinburgh, and again entered on the career of
academical purfuits, under the tuition of Dr Monro,
and thofe other teachers, whofe abilities raifed the
fame of the medical fchool at this place. But not fa-
tisfied with the indrudlions to be had from any one fet
of profeflbrs, the celebrity of the medical teachers in
London led him alfo to vifit that capital. There he
particularly became the pupil of thofe diftinguifhed
ledlurers, Dr Hunter and Dr Smellie. And while
from the former he laboured to acquire an accurate
chirurgical knowledge, from the latter he endeavoured
to obtain the true principles of midwifery confidered
as a fcience. At the fame time he was no lefs induf-
trious in improving himfelf in the fuccefsful practice of
both arts by attention at hofpitals.
Thus prepared for the exercife of his profeffion,
about the end of the year 1749 he fixed his refidence
in Dublin in the character of furgeon and accoucheur.
If amiable manners, and extenfive knowledge of his
profeflion, could alone have been fufficient introduc¬
tions to praflice, he might in a fiiort time have look-
MAC [ 294 ]
Macbride.^ ed for a competent fliare of bufinefs in that capital ;
f ^ but while he had to combat that obje61ion which very
generally arifes from youth, his progrefs was alfo not
a little retarded by an uncommon degree of modelty.
Hence for feveral years he remained almoft in a dale
of obfcurity, and was employed by but few people ei¬
ther of rank or fortune. But, if it is to be regretted
that for many years his time was not fo fully employed
in the lucrative part of his profeihon as was due to
nis merit, it ought ilill to be remembered, that this ef-
fentially. promoted the caufe of fcience : for by this
means his genius and induflry were directed to medical
refearches ; and were produftive of difcoveries which
will with honour tranfmit his name to lateft pofterity.
Thefe, though fome of them might have been fuccefs-
fuily turned to his orvn emolument, were freely com¬
municated to the world in ditferent publications ; and
he did not {how greater ingenuity in making difco¬
veries, than liberality of fentiment in publifhing them
for the advantage of others.—His firft publication,
entitled, “ Experimental Effays on Medical and Phi-
lofophical Subjects,” made its appearance in the year
1764-—Thefe effays are five in number: 1. On the
fermentation of alimentary mixture and the digeftion
of the food. 2. On the nature and properties of fixed
air. 3. On the different kinds of antifeptics. 4. Of
the diflblvent power of quicklime. 5. Of the fea-fcur-
vy. The merit of all thefe is fufficiently known and
acknowledged : but the laft of them is unqueftionably
the moft important \ the method therein propofed of
both the prevention and cure of that dreadful difeafe,
the fcurvy, having been confirmed by repeated and un¬
deniable obfervation.
_ Having thus equally diftinguilhed himfelf as an inge¬
nious philofopher and able pradlitioner, the world were
not now flow in bellowing upon him the tribute of ap-
plaufe to which he was entitled. His name was enrol¬
led with honour in the lifts of many learned focieties *,
aad the univerfity where his ftudies had firft been com¬
menced, W'ere proud to confer upon him the degree of
dodftor of medicine.
The reputation, however, of being a diftinguiftied
author, was to him but a fecondary objedl j and his
talents wTere not confined to the advancement of medi¬
cine alone. Having fuccefsfully difcovered a confider-
able improvement in the art of tanning, with that
fpirited generofity which is ever the concomitant of
real w'orth, he fpeedily and freely communicated it to
the public, by publifning, firft, “ An Account of a
New Method of Tanning and afterwards, “ Inftruc-
tions for carrying on the New Method of Tanning.”
As a mark of approbation for this liberal condudl, as
well as a teftimony of refpett for his ingenuity, prize-
medals were conferred upon him by the Societies of
Arts both in London and Dublin. But his laft and
moft extenfive publication w?as more immediately in
the line of his own profefiion : It is entitled, “ A Me¬
thodical Introduftion to the Theory and Pra&ice of
Medicine. * In that valuable work he has given a
concife and connefled view of the principles and prac¬
tice of the healing art, as beft eftablifhed by found
reafon, and confirmed by accurate obfervation. Moft,
if not all, of thefe publications, not only went through
various editions, but were tranflated into different lan¬
guages.

After the merit cr Dr hlacbride came to be proper- Nacbrkle
ly known, the public feemed to (how a defire of mak- „ il
ing compenfation for having fo long overlooked it. Mace'
His employment increafed fo rapidly, that he had more
bufinefs than he could tranfatl either with cafe or fafe-
ty. 1 his having kept him in perpetual agitation both
of body and mind, at laft induced an almoft total in¬
capacity of fleeping. From this circumftance his health
could not fail to be impaired. In this fituat on, after
accidental expofare to cold, he w7as attacked with a
fever, which put an end to his life on the 13th of De¬
cember 1778, in the 53d year of his age.
Thofe who w^ere his moft intimate acquaintance
wrere inclined to believe that his death wTas not a little
haftened by domeftic calamities. During his refidence
in Dublin he w'as twice married, and was as often lub-
jedled to that inexpreflible diftrefs which muft refult
from a final feparation in this world from the moft inti¬
mate and loving friends. By both of his wuves he
had feveral children ; but none of them furvived their
father. And on thefe calamitous events, although he
was able to conceal his feelings from the world, yet
they gave a fevere ftiock to his conftitution. After
his death, feveral of the playful trinkets of his infants,
with the fignature of dulces exuvia, were found in his
repofitories among papers on medical and other import¬
ant fubje&s : an incontrovertible proof, that in him at
leaft, the great mind of the philofopher was conjoin¬
ed with the feeling heart of the affeilionate father.
But if his abilities were remarkable as a philofopher
and phyfician, if his conducl wTas exemplary as a huf-
band and parent, his manners w’ere no lefs amiable as
a companion and friend. His polite and benevolent
condud, joined to his tafte for the fine arts, conciliated
the affections and eiteem of all who knew him. His
death was univerfally and fincerely lamented in the city
of Dublin.

MACEDON, or Macedonia, a moft celebrated
kingdom of antiquity, was bounded on the eaft by
the /Egean fea ; on the fouth by Theffafy and Epirus ;
on the weft by the Ionian fea or Adriatic ; on the
north, at firft by the river Strymon and the Scardian
mountains, but afterwards by tbe river Nefius or Nef-
tus. In a direft line the whole country extended
only 150 miles in length •, but the windings of the
coaft lengthened it out to three times that extent ; in
which almoft every convenient fituation was occupied
by a Grecian fea-port. The country rvas naturally
divided by the Thermaic and Strymonic gulrs, into
the provinces of Pieria, Chalcis, and Pangmus. 1 he
middle region, which took its name from a city of
Euboea from whence it was originally peopled, was
very fertile and pleafant; the inland country, being
diverfified by lakes, rivers, and arms of the fea, was
extremely convenient for inland navigation, while the
towns of Amphipolis, Potidaea, Acanthus, and many
others, afforded marts for the commerce of the republics
of Greece, as well as of Thrace and Macedon. On
one fide of this diftridl were the mountains of Pangaeus,
and on the other the plains of Pieria. The Pangtean
mountains, which extended 90 miles towards the eaft
and the river Neffus, though proper neither for corn
nor pafture, produced plenty of timber for ftfip-build-
ing j while the fouthern branches of the mountains
contained rich veins of gold and filver } but thefe,
though wrought fucceffively by the Thafians and the
Athenians, were only brought to perfeftion by Philip
of Macedon, who extrafled from them gold and filver
to the value of 200,000!. fterling annually. Pieria ex¬
tended 50 miles along the Thermaic gulf, to the
confines of Theffaly and Mount Pindus. The inland
part of the country was beautifully diverfified with
fhady hills and fountains; and fo admirably calculated
for folitary walks and retirement, that the ancients
looked upon it to be the favourite haunt of the Mufes,
and accordingly bellowed upon them the title of Pie-
rides.
In the moft early times this country was called JE.ma-
thia, from JEtnathius one of its princes. The name of
Macedon is faid to have been derived from Macedo a
defeendant of Deucalion •, though others fuppofe it
to have been only a corruption of Mygdonia a diftriit
of the country. In thofe remote ages of antiquity,
Macedon, like moft other countries of Europe, was
divided into a great number of petty principalities,
of which fcarce even the names are known at this
time. All authors agree, however,, that was
the firft who eftablffhed any permanent fovereignty
] MAG
in Macedon. He was an Argive, a defeendant of Macedon.,
Hercules, and about 800 years B. C. conduced a ' ^
fmall colony of his countrymen into the inland diftriil
of Macedon, at that time diftinguiftied by the name of
JE/nathia as already mentioned. This territory was
about 300 miles in circumference. On the fouth it
was feparated from the fea by a number of Greek re¬
publics, of which the moft confiderable were thofe of
Olynthus and Amphipolis 5 and on the north, eaft, and
weft, was lurrounded by the barbarous kingdoms of
Thrace, Poeonia, and lilyricum. According to the
traditions of thofe times, Caranus, having confulted
the oracle on the fuccefs of his intended expedition, '
was commanded to be direcled by the goats in the efta-
blifhment of his empire. For fome time he proceeded
at random, without knowing what to make of the ora¬
cle’s anfwer j but happening to enter the fmall kingdom-
of JEmathia, at that time governed by King Midas, he
obferved a herd of goats running towards EdeJJa the
capital. Recolle£ling then the anfwer of the oracle,
he attacked and took the city by furprife, foon after
making himfelf mafter of the whole kingdom. In me¬
mory of this remarkable event he called the city lEgea,
and the people JEgiates, from the goats who conduced
him, and made ufe of the figure of a goat in his ftand-
ard. From this fable alfo we fee why the figure of a
goat is fo frequently feen on the coins of Philip and his
fucceffors. 4
The little colony of Argives led into Aimathia by Policy of
Caranus would foon have been overwhelmed by the t!lis Pnncc>
barbarous nations who furrounded it, had not this prince
and his fubjefts taken care to ingratiate themfelves with
their neighbours, rather than to attempt to fubdue them
by force of arms. They inftrufted them in the Grecian
religion and government, and in the knowledge of many
ufeful arts •, adopting themfelves, in fome degree, the
language and manners of the barbarians ; imparting
to them in return fome part of the Grecian civiliza¬
tion and polite behaviour. Thus they gradually affo-
ciated with the fierce and warlike tribes in their neigh¬
bourhood 5 and this prudent conduff, being followed by
fucceeding generations, may be looked upon as one of
the caufes of the Macedonian greatnefs.
Caranus, dying after a reign of three years, left the
kingdom to his fon Cosnus; who having confiderably
enlarged his dominions, was fucceeded by Thurymas, 5-
and he by Perdiccas I. This laft prince is by Thucy-Perdiccas I.

derftandiug which had fubfifted between the Macedo¬

interruption ; and in 691 B. C. the kingdom was for

Macedon. the Babylonian empire, and conquered all the weftern

threatened all the eaflern parts of Europe with fub-
jugation. The Greeks, however, having now emerged
from their barbarifm, and acquired great knowledge
in the art of war, w^ere able to refill; effectually this
very formidable power,*, but the kingdom of Macedon,
oblcure and unconnected, was obliged to yield, and
though not formally made a province of the Perfian
empire, was neverthelefs accounted in fome fort as un¬
der the vaflalage and protection of the Perlians. Al-
cetas, who afcended the Macedonian throne about the
time that the Perlian monarchy was founded, had the
dexterity to preferve his dominions from the encroach¬
ments of the Greeks on the one hand, and of the Per-
hans on the other; but in the reign of his fucceiTor
Amyntas, a formal demand was made of fubmitlion to
the great king Darius, by fending him a prefent of
earth and water. Seven ambafladors were fent on this
errand by Megabizus, one of the officers of Darius.
They were fumptuoufly entertained by Amyntas j but
having attempted to take fome indecent liberties with
the Macedonian women, Alexander the king’s fon
cauftd them all to be murdered. This raffi aftion
had almoft proved the ruin of the kingdom *, but
Alexander found means to pacify Bubaris the general
fent againft him by Megahizus, by ffiowing him his
filler Gygaea, a very beautiful woman, with whom the
Perfian fell in love at firll fight, and afterwards married
S her.

in^ToM™'the faithful allies of the Perfians *, and, through the
cedonfrom interell of his fon-in-law, Amyntas obtained the coun-

ference. pUSj at the fame time that the city of Alabanda in Phry¬
gia was given to Amyntas the nephew of Alexander.
The Macedonians dillinguiffied themfelves in the time
of the Perfian invafion of Greece, by furnifhing their
allies w ith 200,000 recruits; though fome cities, par¬
ticularly Potidsea, Olynthus, and Pallene, adhered to
the Grecian intereft. The twro lalt were taken and
rafed, and the inhabitants mafiacred by the Perfians j
but Potidaea efcaped by reafon of the fea breaking
into the Perfian camp, wffiere it did great damage.
Alexander, however, afterwards thought proper to
court the favour of the Greeks by giving them intel¬
ligence of the time wffien Mardonius defigned to attack
them. The remaining tranfadlions of this reign are
entirely unknown, farther than that he enlarged his
dominions to the river Neflus on the call and the Axius
9 on the weft.
JB,eign of Alexander I. was fucceeded by his fon Perdiccas II.
PerdiccasII according to Dr Gillies, “ inherited his father’s
abilities, though not his integrity.” But from his du¬
plicity above mentioned both to Greeks and Perfians,
it does not appear that he had much to boaft of as
to the latter quality. In the Peloponnefian war he
efpoufed the caufe of the Spartans againft the Athe¬
nians, from whom he wras in danger by reafon of their
numerous fettlements on the Macedonian coaft, and
their great power by fea. For fome time, however,
he amufed the Athenians with a ffiow of friendlliip ;

nians in its ftead. But this defign failed of fuccefs ; the w~v——■
Olynthian confederacy was broken, and the members
of it became fubject to Sparta, until at laft, by the mis¬
fortunes of that republic, they became iufficiently power¬
ful not only to refift the encroachments of the Macedo¬
nians, but to make cenfiderable conquefts in their
country. I0
Perdiccas II. was fucceeded about 416 B. C. by Of Arche-
Archelaus I. Pie enlarged his dominions by the con-^ausP
queft of Pydna, and other places in Pieria, though his
ambition feems rather to have been to improve his do¬
minions than greatly to extend them. He facilitated
the communication between the principal towns of Ma¬
cedon, by cutting ftraight roads through moft part of
the country : he built walls and fortreiles in fuch places
as afforded a favourable fituation ; encouraged agricul¬
ture and the arts, particularly thofe fubfervient to war j
formed magazines of arms *, raifed and difeiplined a
confiderable body of cavalry $ and in a word, fays Df
Gillies, added more to the folid grandeur of Macedon
than had been done by all his predecelfors put together.
Nor wras he regardlefs of the arts of peace. His palace
was adorned by the works of Grecian painters. Euri¬
pides was long entertained at his court *, Socrates was
earneftly foliated to live there, after the example of
this philofophic poet, formed by his precepts and che-
rithed by his friendfhip : men of merit and genius in
the various walks of literature and fcience were invited
to refide in Macedon, and treated with diftinguiftied re¬
gard by a monarch duly attentive to promote his own
glory and the happinefs of his fubjefts.” 11
This great monarch died after a reign of fix years, The king-
a fpace by far too fhort to accomplifh the magnificent dom be-
projefts he had formed. After his death the k!ng-comes a .
dom fell under the power of ufurpers or weak and^^j^,^’

ftantly appeared for the throne j and thefe by turns
called in to their affiftance the Thracians, Illyrians,
Theffalians, the Olynthian confederacy, Athens, Sparta,
and Thebes. Bardyllis, an aflive and daring chief,
who, from being head of a gang of robbers, had be¬
come fovereign of the Illyrians, entered Macedon at
the head of a numerous army, depofed Amyntas II. the
father of Philip, and fet up in his place one Argasus,
who confented to become tributary to the Illyrians.
Another candidate for the throne, named Paufanias,
was fupported by the Thracians; but, by the affiftance
of the Theffalians and Olynthians, Amyntas was ena¬
bled to refume the government. After his reftoration,
however, the Olynthians refufed to deliver up feveral
places of importance belonging to Macedon which A-
myntas had either intrufted to their care, or which they ^
had taken from his antagonift. Amyntas complained war

Philip ar- Philip, the late king’s brother, no fooner heard of
et'do 'n^a"his defeat and death, than he fet out privately from
Thebes j and on his arrival in Macedon found matters
in the fituation we have juft now7 defcribed. Fired
with an infatiable ambition, it is very probable that
from the very firft moment he had refolved to feize
the kingdom for himfelf} yet it was neceflary at firft
to pretend that he affumed the throne only to preferve
it for his nephew7. Philip, as has already been men¬
tioned, was carried off as a hoftage by Pelopidas,
but for a long time paft had rema>ined in liich obfcuri-
ty, that hiftorians difagree as to his place of refidence j
fome placing him in Thebes, and others in Macedon.
It is certain, however, that from the age of 15 he had
been very much in the family of Epaminondas, from
whofe leffons he could not but derive the greateft emo¬
lument. It is probable alfo that he attended this cele¬
brated general in many of his expeditions *, and it is
certain, that, wdth an attendance fuitable to his rank,
he vifited moft of the principal republics, and Ihowcd
an attention to their inftitutions, both civil and mili¬
tary, far fuperior to his years. Having eafy accefs to
whomfoever he pleafed, he cultivated the friendftiip of
the firft: people in Greece. Even in Athens, w7here no
good w7ill fubfifted with Macedon, the philofophers
Plato, Ifocrates, and Ariftotle, cultivated his acquaint¬
ance : and the connexion he formed wdth the principal
leaders of that republic in the early period of his life,
no doubt contributed greatly to the accomplilhment of
the defigns in which he afterwards proved fo fuccefsful.
His appearance in Macedon inftantly changed the face
of affairs: the Macedonian army, though defeated, was
not entirely deftroyed *, and the remainder of them fe-
cured themfelves in the fortreffes which had been built
by Archelaus. There wrere alfo confiderable garrifons
in the fortreffes, and willed towms fcattered over the
kingdom ; and the Illyrians, who had made war only
for the fake of plunder, foon returned home to enjoy
the fruits of their victory His other enemies, the Thra¬
cians and Paeonians, were much lefs formidable than
the Illyrians, being ftill in a very rude and uncivilized
ftate, incapable of uniting under one head in fuch a
manner as to bring any formidable army into the field.
While the Illyrians therefore gave up the campaign
through mere caprice and unfteadinefs, Philip himfelf
applied to the Paeonians, and by fair promifes and flat¬
tery prevailed upon them to defift. The king of Thrace,
by means of a fum of money, was eafily prevailed upon
to abandon the caufe of Paufanias; fo that Philip, freed
from thefe barbarians, w7as now7 left, at liberty to oppofe
the Athenians, who fupported Argaeus, and threatened
a very formidable invafion.

wrhich indeed the danger of the times afforded a veryon lA™ the
plaufible pretext. Argaeus, in the mean time, advan-ioveleiSntT
ced with his Athenian allies towards Edeffa or Atge,
the ancient capital of the Macedonian empire, where
he hoped to have been amicably received j but finding
the gates fhut againft him, he returned back to Me- 21
thone. Philip haraffed him in his retreat, cutting off ^efeats an(l
great numbers of his men, and afterwards defeated ^‘':s
him in a general engagement; in which Argaeus him-erianUlU1^~
felf, with the flower of his army, was cut in pieces, and
all the reft taken prifoners.
This firft inftanee of fuccefs contributed greatly to
raife the fpirits of Philip’s party •, and he himfelf took 22
care to improve it in the beft manner poflible. Hav-Pkfiip’spo-
ing taken a great number of prifoners, both Macedo-Iitlc treat-
nians and Athenians, he determined, by his treatment
of them, to ingratiate himfelf with both parties.
The former were called into his prefence, and, after
a gentle reprimand, admitted to (wear allegiance to
him ; after which they were diftributed through the
army : the Athenians w7ere entertained at his table,
difmiffed without ranfom, and their baggage reftored.
The prifoners were juft allowed time to return to their
native city and to fpread abroad the news of Philip’s
generofity, when they were followed by ambaffadors ,,
from Macedon with propofals for peace. As he knew Renounces
that the lofs of Amphipolis had greatly irritated them, his right to
he now thought proper to renounce his jurifdiftion 4-mkMp°"
over that city j and it w7as accordingly declared freeila'
and independent, and fubjedl only to the government
of its own free and equitable laws. This artful con-
duff, together with his kind treatment of the prifoners,
fo wrought upon the minds of the Athenians, that they
confented to the renewal of a treaty which had formerly
fubfifted between them and his father Amyntas. Thus
he found means to remove all jealoufy of his ambition
or the fchemes he might afterwards undertake to their
prejudice j and not only this, but to induce them to
engage in a ruinous war with their allies, which occu¬
pied their attention until Philip had an opportunity of
getting his matters fo well eftabliftied that it was impof-
fible to overthrow them.
The new king being thus left at liberty to regulate Reducestke
his domeftic concerns, began to circumfcribe the power power of the
of his chiefs and nobles j who, efpecially in the more nobility,
remote provinces, paid very little regard to the autho¬
rity of the kings of Macedon •, fometimes, even in
times of public calamity, throwing off their allegiance
altogether, and affuming an independent government 25

Alexander were afterwards greatly aflifted in their con-
quefts. .
Diodorus Siculus, and all the Roman writers who
have treated of the hiitory of Greece, affert that Phi¬
lip, in the firft year of his reign, inftituted the Mace¬
donian phalanx > a body of 6000 men armed with
Ihort fwords fitted either for cutting or {tabbing, hav¬
ing alfo ftrong bucklers four feet long and two and a
half broad, and pikes 14 feet long-, ufually marching
16 men deep. But this opinion is controverted by
others. Dr Gillies fuppofes that the opinion had
arifen from the Romans meeting with the phalanx in
its molt complete form in Macedon 5 and as they be¬
came acquainted with Greece and Macedon pretty
nearly at the fame time, it was natural for them to
fuppofe that it had been invented among the Macedo¬
nians. The phalanx, he fays, is nothing different
from the armour and arrangement which had always
prevailed among the Greeks, and which Philip adopt¬
ed in their molt perfeft form “ nor is there reafon
(fays he) to think that a prince, vcho knew the dan¬
ger of changing w7hat the experience of ages had ap¬
proved, made any alteration in the weapons or tallies
of that people. The improvement in the counter¬
march, to which Philip gave the appearance of advan¬

Tactics, cap. xxviii. was borrowed, as this author tells
us, from the Lacedemonians. If Philip increafed the pha¬
lanx, ufually lefs numerous, to 6000 men, this was far
from an improvement; and the latter kings of Mace¬
don, who fvvelled it to 16,000, only rendered that or¬
der of battle more unwieldy and inconvenient.” Inltead
of this, Philip, according to our author, employed him-
felf in procuring arms, horfes, and other neceflary ma¬
terials for wrar ; and in introducing a more fevere and
exa£t military difeipline than had formerly been known
in Macedon.
While the king thus took the bell methods to ren¬
der himfelf fecure at home and formidable abroad, the
Paeonians again began to make incurfions into the
kingdom. The death of Agis their king,, however,
who was a man of great military ikill, deprived them
almoft of every power of refiftance when they were
attacked. Philip, of confequence, overran their coun¬
try with little oppofition, and reduced them to the ftate
of tributaries to Macedon. No fooner w-as this accom-
piifired, than he undertook a winter’s campaign againft
the Illyrians, who had long been the natural enemies
of Macedon. They had now extended their territory
to the eaft ; by which means the Macedonians were ex¬
cluded from the harbours on the coaft of the Adriatic.
This was a grievance to Philip, who feems early to
have meditated the raifing of a naval power ; neither
could he hope to be in fafety, ftrould the kingdom be
left open to the incurfions of a barbarous enemy j for
which reafons he determined at once to humble thofe
enemies in fuch a manner that they ftrould no longer be
in a fituation to give him any difturbance. After an
ineffeflual negociation, he wras met by Bardyllis at the
head of a confiderable body of infantry, but with only
400 horfe. They made a gallant refiftance for forae
time j but being unable to cope wfith fucu a fkilful. ge- Macedoft,
neral as Philip, they were defeated with the Ids d
7000 men, among w-hom wras their leader Bardyllis,
WTho fell at the age of 90. _ 28
By this difafter the Illyrians were fo much dilheart- They are
ened, that they fent ambaffadors to Pmlip, humbly
begging for peace on any terms. I he con(lue_ror tributary,
granted them the fame conditions which had been im-
pofed upon the Paeonians, viz. the becoming tributary,
and yielding up to him a confiderable part of their
country. That part of it which lay to the eaftward
of a lake named Lychnidus he annexed to Macedon}
and probably built a town and fettled a colony there j
the country being fertile, and the lake abounding w7itu
many kinds of fifh highly efteemed oy the ancients.
This town and lake w7ere about jo miles diftant from
the Ionian fea 5 and fuch was the afcendancy which the
arms and policy of Philip acquired over his neighbours,
that the inhabitants of all the intermediate aiftrift foon
adopted the language and manners of their conquerors j
and their territory, hitherto unconne&ed with any fo¬
reign power, funk into fuch abfolute dependence upon
Macedon, that many ancient geographers fuppofed it to
be a province of that country. 29
Philip had no fooner reduced the Illyrians, than he great
began to put in execution greater dengns tnan any he
had yet attempted. The rich coafts to the fouthward
of Macedon, inhabited chiefly by Greeks, prefented
a ftrong temptation to his ambition and avarice. I he
confederacy of Olynthus, after having thrown off the
yoke of Sparta, was become more powerful than ever,
and could fend into the field an army of 10,000 heavy
armed troops, befides a pumber of cavalry in propor¬
tion. Moft of the towns in Chalcidice were become
its allies or fubjefts; fo that this populous and wealthy
province, together with Pangaeus on the right and
Pieria on the left, of both which the cities w7ere ei¬
ther independent or fubjedt to the Athenians, formed
a barrier not only fufficient to guard againft any in¬
curfions of the Macedonians, but which was even for-
midable to them. But though Philip was fenfible Plans the
enough of the importance of thofe places, he confi-conque.il
dered the conqueft of Amphipolis as more neceffary 0) ijl3‘np
at the prefent time. By the poffeflion of this place
Macedon would be conne&ed with the fea, and would
be fecured in many commercial advantages, which
could not but contribute greatly to the profperity of
the kingdom at large -, a road w7as likewife opened to
the w7oods and mines of Pangaeus, the former of which
were fo neceffary to the raifing of a naval power, and
the latter for the eftabliftrment of a proper military
force. This city had indeed been declared indepen¬
dent by Philip himfelf in the beginning of his reign $
but this was only to prevent a rupture with the Athe¬
nians, who ftill afferted their right to it as an ancient
colony ; though, by reafon of the perfidy of Chari-
demus, a native of Euboea, they had hitherto failed
in their attempts to recover it. The Amphipolitans,
however, having once enjoyed the fweets of liberty,
prepared to maintain themfelves in their independence.
In the mean time the hoftile defigns of Philip, which
all his precaution had not been able to conceal, alarm¬
ed the inhabitants to fuch a degree, that they thought
proper to put themfelves under the prote£fion of the
Olynthians. By them they were readily received in-

to the confederacy j and, trufting to the ftrength
their new allies, behaved in fuch an infolent manner
to Philip, that he was not long of finding a fpecious
pretext for hoflility ; at which the Olynthians, great¬
ly alarmed, fent ambafladors to Athens, requefling
their affidance againft fuch a powerful enemy. Philip,
however, juftly alarmed at fuch a formidable confpi-
racy, fent agents to Athens, with fuch expedition
that they arrived there before any thing could be con¬
cluded with the Olynthian deputies. Having gained
over tne popular leaders and orators, he deceived and
flattered the magistrates and fenate in fuch an artful
manner, that a negociation was inffantly fet on foot,
by which Philip engaged to conquer Amphipolis for
the Athenians, upon condition that they furrendered
to him the flrong fortrefs of Pytlna, a place which
he reprefented as of much lefs importance to them ;
promiling alio to confer upon them many other ad¬
vantages, which, however, he did not fpecify at that
time. ”1 hus the Athenians, deceived by the perfidy
of their own magiftrates, elated with the hopes of re¬
covering Aravhipolis, and outwitted by the fuperior
policy of Philip, reje£led with dildain the proffers of
the Olynthians.
T<;e ambaffadors of Olynthus returned home highly
dhgufted with the reception they had met with ; but
had icarce time to communicate the news to their coun¬
trymen, when the ambaffadors of Philip arrived at O-
lynthus. He pretended to condole with them on the
affront they had received at Athens $ but teftified his
furprife that they fhould court the affiftance of that dif-
tant and haughty republic, when they could avail them-
felves of the powerful kingdom of Macedon, which
wifhed for nothing more than to enter into equal and
lading engagements with their confederacy. As a proof
of his moderation and fincerity, he offered to put them
in poifelficn of Anthemus, an important town in the
neighbourhood, of which the Macedonians had long
claimed the jurifdiftion, making many other fair pro¬
miles •, and among the reft, that he would reduce for
them the cities of Pydna and Potidaea, which he chofe
rather to fee in dependence on Olynthus than Athens.
Thus he prevailed upon the Olynthians not only to
abandon Amphipolis, but to aftift him with all their
pow'er in the execution of his defigns.
Philip now loft no time in executing his purpofes on
Amphipolis ; and preffed the city fo clofely, that the
people were glad to apply to the Athenians for relief.
Accordingly they defpatched tw’o of their moft eminent
citizens, Hierax and Stratocles, to reprefent the dan¬
ger of an alliance betwixt Philip and the Olynthians,
and to profefs their forrew for having fo deeply offend¬
ed the parent ft ate. This reprefentation had fuch an
effedf, that though the Athenians w7ere then deeply
engaged in the Social war, they would probably have
paid feme attention to the Amphipolitans, had not Phi¬
lip taken care to fend them a letter with frefh affuran-
ces of friendftn’p, acknowledging their right to Amphi¬
polis, and which he hoped Shortly to put into their
hands in terms of his recent agreement. By thefe fpe¬
cious pretences the Athenians were perfuaded to pay as
little regard to the deputies of the Amphipolitans as
they had already done to thofe of the Olynthians ;

Philip ftill proceeded in the fame cautious and poli¬
tic manner in which he had begun. Though the ob-
ftinate defence of the Amphipolitans might have fur-
nilhed a pretence for feverity, he contented himfelf
with baniftiing a few of the popular leaders from w hom
he had moft caufe to dread oppofttion, treating the
reft of the inhabitants with all manner of clemency ;
but took care to add Amphipolis to his own domi¬
nions, from which he was determined that it never
fhould be feparated, notwithftanding the promifes he
had made to the Athenians. Finding that it was not
his intereft at this time to fall out with the Olynthians,
he cultivated the friendfhip of that republic with great
affiduity; took the cities of Pydna and Potidaea,
wftiich he readily yielded to the Olynthians, though
they had given him but little afftftance in the reduFrion
of thefe places. Potidaea had been garrifoned by the
Athenians j and them the artful king fent back with¬
out ranfom, lamenting the neceflity of his affairs which
obliged him, contrary to his inclination, to oppofe their
republic. Though this w7as rather too grofs, the A-
thenians at prefent were fo much engaged with the So¬
cial war, that they had not leifure to attend to the affairs
of other nations. Philip made the beft ufe of his time,
and next projected the conqueft of the gold mines of ^
Thrace. That rich and fertile country was now held Makes him-

goddefs Minerva, with wThom he fancied himfelf in
love. The invafion of the Macedonians, however,
aw7aked him from his reverie ; and Cotys, finding him¬
felf deftitute of other means of oppofitlon, attempted
to Hop the progrefs of the enemy by a letter. To this
Philip paid no regard : the Thracians were inftantly
expelled from their pofleflions at Crenidse, where there
were very valuable gold mines. Thefe had formerly
been worked by colonies from Thafos and Athens; but
the colonifts had long fince been expelled by the barba¬
rous Thracians, w7ho knew not how to make ufe of
the treafure they were in poffeffion oft Philip took
the trouble to defeend into the mines himfelf, in order
to infpeff the w7orks; and having caufed them to be
repaired, planted a Macedonian colony at Crenida;,
bellowed upon it the name of Philippi, and drew
annually from the gold mines to the value of near
1000 talents, or 200,cool, fterling ; an immenfe fum
in thofe days. The coins ftruck here were likewife call¬
ed Philippi.
Philip having obtained this valuable acquifition, Settles the
next took upon him to fettle the affairs of Theffaly, affairs of
where every thing w7as in confufion. This country Tlieffaly
had been formerly oppvefied by Alexander tyrant of^^^0
Pherae; after whofe death three others appeared, viz.tage!
Tiffiphornus, Pitholaus, and Lycophron, the brothers-
in law of Alexander, w7ho had likewife murdered him.
By the united efforts of the Theffalians and Macedo¬
nians, however, thefe ufurpers were eafily overthrowm,
and effedlually prevented from making any difturbances
for the future ; and the Theffalians, out of a miftaken
gratitude, furrendered to Philip all the revenues arifing

Macedon.

from their fairs and towns of commerce, as well as all
the conveniences of their harbours and {hipping j a
concellion which Philip took care to fecure in the moft
effeftual manner.
Having now not only eftablilhed his fovereignty in
the molt eft’e&ual manner, but rendered himfelf very
powerful and formidable to his neighbours, Philip de¬
termined to enjoy feme repofe from his fatigues. Hav¬
ing formed an alliance with Arybbas king of Epirus,
he, in the year 357 B. C. married Olympias the fi¬
lter of that prince ; a match thought the more eligible,
as the kings of Epirus were fuppofed to be defeended
from Achilles. The nuptials were folemnized at Pella
with great pomp, and feveral months were fpent
in fhows and diverlions; during which Philip {bowed
fuch an extreme pronenefs to vice of every kind, as
difgraced him in the eyes of his neighbours, and moft
probably laid the foundation of his future domeftic un-
happinefs. So much was this behaviour of the Mace¬
donian monarch taken notice of by the neighbouring
Hates, that the Pteonians and Illyrians threw off the
yoke, engaging in their febemes the king of Thrace :
and notwithftanding the infane ftate of that prince, their
defigns wpe now carried on with more judgement than
was ufual with barbarians. Philip, however, not¬
withftanding his diftipation, got warning of his dan¬
ger in fufficient time to prevent the bad confequences
which might have enfued had the confederates got
time to bring their matters to a proper bearing. Early
in the fpring 356 he took the field with the flower of
the Macedonian troops. Having marched in perfon
againft the Paeonians and Thracians, he defpatched
Parmenio his beft general into Illyria. Both enter-
prifes proved fuccefsful j and while Philip returned
viftorious from Thrace, he received an account of the
viftory gained by Parmenio a fecond meffenger in¬
formed him of a viftory gained by his chariot at the
Olympic games •, and a third, that Olympias had been
delivered of a fon at Pella. This was the celebrated
Alexander, to whom the diviners prophefied the higheft
profperity and glory, as being born in fuch aufpicious
circumftances.
A Ihort time after the birth of Alexander, Philip
wrote a letter to the philofopher Ariftotle, wdiom he
chofe for preceptor to his young fon. The letter was
written with great brevity, containing only the fol¬
lowing words : “ Know that a fon is born to us. We
thank the gods not fo much for their gift, as for
bellowing it at a time when Ariftotle lives. We af-
fure ourfe'ves that you will form him a prince worthy
of his father, and worthy of Macedon.” He next
fet about the farther enl.trgement of his territories,
which were already very confiderable. Paeonia was
now one of his provinces; on the eaft his dominions
extended to the fea of Thafos, and on the weft to
the lake Lychnidus. The Theffalians were in effect
fubjeft to his jurifdi&ion, and the poffeflion of Am-
phipolis had fecured him many commercial advantages;
he had a numerous and well-difciplined army, with
plentiful refources for fupporting fuch an armament,
and carrying through the other fchemes fuggefted by
his ambition ; though his deep and impenetrable poli¬
cy rendered him more truly formidable than all thefe
put together. His firft fcheme was the redu£fion of
Olynthus, the moft populous and fertile country on
1 ] MAC
the borders of Macedon ; after which his ambition Macedon.^
prompted him to acquire the fovereignty of all Greece.^
To accomplilh the former, he had hitherto courted the
friendlhip of the Olynthians by every poflible method ;
and without letting flip any opportunity to accomplilh
the latter, he deprived the Athenians gradually of feveral
of their fettlements in Thrace and Macedon. In thefe
depredations, however, he took care always to give
fuch appearance of juftice to his aftions, that his an-
tagonifts, who had ftudied the matter lefs deeply,
could not find a plaufible pretext for engaging in war
againft him, even when he had openly committed ho-
ftilities againft-them. Philip eafily perceived that the
affairs of the Greeks were coming to a crilis, and he
determined to wait the event of their mutual diffen- 42
fions. That event did not difappoint his hopes.. The Account of
Phocians had violated the religion of thofe days in a the
moft extraordinary manner , they had even ploughed up%'ar‘
the lands confecrated to Apollo : and however they
might pretend to excufe themfelves by examples, the
Amphhftyons fulminated a decree againft the Phocians,
commanding the facred lands to be laid wafte, and im-
poling an heavy fine upon the community.
By this decree all Greece was again involved in the
war called P/iocian, from the name of the city about
which it commenced. Philip at the beginning of the
troubles was engaged in Thrace, where a civil wrar had
taken place among the ions of Cotys; and wherever
Philip interfered, he was fare to make matters turn
out to his owm advantage. His encroachments at
length became fo enormous, that Kerfobletes, the moft
powerful of the contending princes, agreed to cede
the Thracian Cherfonefus to the Athenians; who
immediately fent Chares at the head of a powerful
armament to take poffeflion of it. In this expedition
the town of Seftos was taken by ftorm, and the inha¬
bitants cruelly treated by Chares, wrhile Philip employ- 4.
ed himfelf in the fiege of Methone in Pieria. This city Philip lofes
he likewife reduced; but the king loft an eye at the Aegean eye at
in the following extraordinary manner, if we may give^^S^0^
credit to fdme ancient hiftorians. A celebrated archer,1
named After, had, it feems, offered his fervices to Phi¬
lip, being reprefented as fuch an excellent markfman,
that he could hit the fwifteft bird on the wing. Phi¬
lip replied, that he wmuld be of excellent ufe if they
were to make war with ftarlings. After, difgufted with
this reception, went over to the enemy, and with
an arrow wounded the king in the eye. When the
weapon w-as extrafted, it was found to have on it the
following infeription : “ For the right eye of Philip.”
The king ordered the arrow’ to be {hot back again,
with another infeription, importing that he would
caufe After to be hanged when the town wTas taken.
A report was raifed after Philip’s death, that he had
loft his eye by prying too narrowfty into the amours of
Olympias and Jupiter Ammon ; which the vanity of
his fucceffor prompted him to cherifti, as his flatterers
had probably been the inventors of it.
All this time the Phocian war raged with the great-
eft fury, and involved in it all the ftates of Greece.
Lycophron, one of the Theffalian tyrants, w’hom Philip 44
had formerly deprived of his authority, had again enSa§e^
found means to re-eftablifti his authority, and his coun-wjtll 0no,

accordingly marched into Thefl'aly with a confiderable
army, defeated Phyallus the brother of Onomarchus,
whom the latter had lent into the country with a de¬
tachment of 7000 men. After this he befieged and
took the eity of Pegafae, driving the enemy towards
the frontiers of Phocis. Onomarchus then advanced
with the whole army; and Philip, though! inferior in
numbers, did not decline the engagement. The Pho-
cians at firlt gave ground, on which the Macedonians
purfued, but in good order ; but coming near a pre-
45 cipice, on the top of which Onomarchus had ported

dreadful execution, and threw them into the utmoft
diforder. Philip, however, rallied his troops with
great prelence of mind, and prevented the Phocians
from gaining any farther advantage than they had
already done ; faying, as he drew off his men, that
they did not retreat through fear, but like rams, in
order to ftrike with the greater vigour. Nor w’as he
long before he made good his affertion ; for having re¬
cruited his army with the greateft expedition, he re¬
turned into Theffaly at the head of 20,000 foot and
500 horfe, where he was met by Onomarchus. The
eel and kill- Macedonians at this time were fuperior in number to
ed. their enemies ; and Philip moreover took care to re¬
mind them, that their quarrel w7as that of heaven, and
that their enemies had been guilty of facrilege, by pro¬
faning the temple of Delphi. That they might be
ftill more animated in the caufe, he put crowns of laurel
on their heads. Thus fired by enthufiafm, and having
befides the advantage of numbers, the Phocians were
altogether unable to withftand them. They threw awray
their arms and fled towards the fea, where they ex-
pe£ted to have been relieved by Chares, who, with
the Athenian fleet, was nigh the fliore : but in this
they were difappointed, for he made no attempt to
fave them. Upwards of 6000 perifhed in the field of
battle or in the purfuit, and 3000 wrere taken prifon-

the flain, was by order of Philip hung upon a gibbet
as a mark of infamy, on account of his having polluted
'the temple ; the bodies of the reft w7ere thrown into the
fea, as being all partakers of the fame crime. The
fate of the prifoners is not known, by reafon of an am¬
biguity in a fentence of Diodorus Siculus, which may
imply that they were drowned, though it does not ex-
47 prefsly fay fo.
Plnlippur- After this victory, Philip fet about the fettlement
of Theffaly, waiting only for an opportunity to put
in execution his favourite fcheme of invading Greece.
In the mean time, he rejoiced to fee the ftates weak¬
ening each other by their mutual diffenfions ; of which
he never failed to take advantage as far as poflible.
He now, however, began to throw off the mafic with
regard to the Oly-athianSj whom he had long deceived
with fair promifes. Having detached Kerfobletes from
the intereft of the Athenians, he eftablifhed him in
the fovereignty of Thrace ; not out of any good will,
but with a view to deftroy him whenever a proper op¬
portunity offered. Were he once poffeffed of the

value the importance of its fituation both with refpeft ~
to commerce and war : and in order to pave tbe way
to this important conqueft, he attacked the fortrefs
of Herasum, a fmall and in itfelf unimportant place,
though, by realon of its neighbourhood to Byzan- 4?
tium, the acquifition was valuable to Philip. Theoppofed
Athenians, however, at lafl began to perceive the de-lj?7 t!ie A'
figns ol Philip, and determined to counteract them. t''er^ar3‘
For this purpofe they entered into an alliance with
Olynthus ; and having warned Kerfobletes of his dan¬
ger, they ordered a powerful fleet to the defence of
the Heraeum. But thefe vigorous meafures were foon
counteracted by the report of Philip’s death, which
had been occafioned by his wound at Methone, and a
diftemper arifing from the fatigues he had afterwards
undergone. 'I lie inconflant Athenians too eaiily gave
credit to this report ; and, as if all danger had been
over with his death, difeontinued their preparations-,
and direfted their whole attention to the facred war.
— Phis contert, inftead of being ended by the death
of Onomarchus, now raged with double fury. Phv-Continua-
allus, above mentioned, the only furviving brother ofb'-H °ftrie
Onomarchus, undertook the caufe of the Phocians; ^ ‘’uc*ari
and his affairs becoming every day more and more del- '‘l"
perate,^ he undertook the molt unaccountable method
of retrieving them which could be imagined : having
converted into ready money the molt precious mate¬
rials belonging to the temple at Delphi, and with this
treafure doubled the pay of his foldiers. By this new
piece of facrilege, he indeed brought many adventiw
rers to his ftandard, though he cut off all hopes of mer¬
cy for bimfelf or his party ftiould he be defeated.
Having the afliftance of loco Lacedemonians, 2000
Achaeans, and 5000 Athenian foot, with 400 cavalry,
he was ftill enabled to make a very formidable appear¬
ance ; and the Phocians took the field with great pro-
fpeCt of fuccefs. ,.0
Philip now thought it time to throw off the malkP’nihp en-
entirely, for which the proceedings of the Athenians,£a£es
particularly their league with Olynthus, furnilhed himthe ‘luarrel?
with a plaufible pretext ; and the revenging fuch hor¬
rid facrilege as had been committed at Delphi feemed
to give him a title to march at the head of an army
into Greece. The fuperftition of the Greeks, how¬
ever, had not yet blinded them to fuch a degree, but
they could eafily perceive that Philip’s piety was a
mere pretence, and that his real defign was to invade
and conquer the whole country. The Athenians no
fooner heard of the march of the Macedonian army,
than they defpatched, with all expedition, a ftrong
guard to fecure the pafs of Thermopylae ; fo that Phi- 51
lip was obliged to return greatly chagrined and dif- Is prevent-
appointed. Their next ftep was to call an affembly,ecl from en,‘
to deliberate upon the meafures proper to be taken in Gireece
order to reftrain the ambition of the Macedonian mo¬
narch ; and this affembly is rendered memorable by
the firft appearance of Demofthenes as an orator
againft Philip. Athens for fome time had been in a
very alarming fituation. They were deeply involved
in the facred war; their northern poffeflions were
continually infulted and plundered by Philip ; while
a number of his mercenary partifans drew off the pub¬
lic attention to fuch a degree, that, inftead of taking

making war upon the Perlians, but that of revenging
former injuries : and on this fubje£f he addreffed a
difcourfe to Philip himfelf; and it is even faid, that
Ilocrates, by the power of his rhetoric, prevailed upon
Philip and the Athenians to lay afide their animolities
for a Ihort time, and confent to undertake this expedi¬
tion in conjunction.

his countrymen, he hoped to be able to roufe them
from their lethargy by dint of his eloquence ; a ta¬
lent he had been at great pains to cultivate, and in
which he is faid to have excelled all men that ever
exifted.
In his firft addrefles to the people, this celebrated
orator exhorted them to awake from their indolence,
and to affume the direftion of their own affairs. They
had been too long governed, he faid, by the incapa¬
city of a few ambitious men, to the great difad vantage
as well as difgrace of the community. In the firft
place, an orator who had placed himfelf at the head
of a faclion of no more than 300 or 400, availed him¬
felf and his followers of the careleffnefs and negligence
of the people, to rule them at pleafure. From a con-
fideration of their prefent weaknefs and corruption,
as well as of the defigns and commotions of the neigh¬
bouring powers, he advifed them to abandon all ro¬
mantic and diftant fchemes of ambition ; and inftead
of carrying their arms into remote countries, to pre¬
pare for repelling the attacks which might be made
upon their own dominions. He infilled alfo upon a
better regulation of their finances, a more equal dif-
tribution of the public burdens, in proportion to the
abilities of thofe upon whom they were laid, and upon
the retrenching many fuperfluous expences. Having
pointed out in a ftrong light the vigorous conduct of
Philip *, and fhown by what, means he had attained
to. fuch a refpe£lable footing in the world, he next
laid down a proper plan for their military operations.
He told them, that they were not yet prepared to
meet Philip in the field j they mull begin with pro-
tefling Oiynthus and the Cherfonefus, for which it
would be necefTary to raife a body of 2000 light arm¬
ed troops, with a due proportion of cavalry, which
ought to be tranfported under a proper convoy to the
i(lands of Lemnos, Thafos, and Sciathos, in the neigh¬
bourhood of Macedon. In thefe they would enjoy
all kinds of neceiTaries in abundance, and might avail
themfelves of every favourable incident, to appear at Macedon.

While this was going on, more vigorous prepa¬
rations might be made for war at home ; and it was
propofed, that only the fourth part of the Athenian
citizens fhould enlifl, and no more fupplies were want¬
ed at prefent but 90 talents. But notwithflanding the
moderation of thefe propofak;, and the urgent necefh-
ties of the {late, it was impoflible to prevail upon the
indolent and carelefs Athenians to provide for their
own fafety. They appear, indeed, at this time to
have been defperately funk in effeminacy and diffipa-
tion j which difpofition Philip took care to encourage
to the utmofl of his power. There was an affembly in
the city called the Sixty, from their confiding original¬
ly of that number, who met exprefsly for the purpofes
of extinguifhing all care about public affairs, and to in¬
toxicate themlelves with every kind of pleafure they had
in their power. With this affembly Philip was fo well
pleafed, that he fent them money to fupport their extra¬
vagancies j and fo effedually did they anfwer his pur¬
pofes, that all the eloquence of Demoflhenes could not
counteratt the fpeeches of orators much his inferiors •
wdien backed by Macedonian gold.
Philip himfelf, as wTe have already hinted, was ex-
ceflively debauched in his private charafter, and the
mod fhameful dories are related of him by the ancient
writers, particularly by Demollhenes. Theopompus^.
too, an author who flourifhed in the time of Alexan¬
der, and was rewarded and honoured by that monarchy
alfo fpeaks of him in fuch terms as we cannot with de¬
cency relate : but thefe accounts, coming from the
avovred enemies of the king, are fcarcely to be credit¬
ed ; and perhaps policy, as well as inclination, might
contribute fomewhat to this fcandalous behaviour, that
he might thereby recommend himfelf to the libertines
of Athens, and prevent even many of the more think-
ing part of the people from fufpefling his defigns. -
But in whatever exceffes he might at times indulge
himfelf, he never lod fight of his main obje£l, the fub-
jugation of the Greek dates. On pretence of being
in want of money to defray the expence of his build¬
ings, he borrowed money at a very high price through¬
out the whole country ; and this he found an eafy mat¬
ter to do, as the diffipation of the Delphic treafures
had rendered cafh very plentiful in Greece. Thus he
attached his creditors firmly to his own intered 5 and
on pretence of paying debts, was enabled without mo-
ledation to bedow a number of penfions and gratuities
upon the Athenian orators, who by their treacherous
harangues contributed greatly to the ruin of their
country 5 at lead as far as it could be ruined by fub-
jedlion to a prince who would have obliged them to
remain at peace, and apply themfelves to ufeful arts.
Thefe he himfelf encouraged in a very eminent decree.
The greated part of his time was employed at Pella,
which city he adorned in the mod magnificent manner
with temples, theatres, and porticoes. He invited
by liberal rewards, the mod ingenious artids in Greece 5
and as many of thefe met with very little encourage¬
ment in their own country, great numbers flocked to
nm fiom all.quarters. In the government of his peo¬
ple, alfo, Philip behaved with the utmod impartiality :

meanefi of liis fubjecb, a:;d keeping up a conftant cor-
refpondence with thofe whom he thought worthy of his
acquaintance ; from which, it is not eafy to imagine
how he could be fo guilty of the vices tve have already
mentioned from fome ancient hiftorians.
The fate of Olynthus wras now foon determined.
This city, which held the balance of power betwixt
Athens and Macedon, w7as taken and plundered, and
the inhabitants fold for Haves; but the chief hope of
Thilip wTas in putting an end to the Phocian war.
For this purpofe he affe&ed a neutrality, that he might
thereby become the arbiter of Greece. His hopes
were wTell founded ; for the Thebans, who were at
the head of the league againft the Phocians, foii-
cited him on the one fide, and the ftates confede-
fate with the Phocians did the like on the other.
He anfwered neither, yet held both in dependence.
In his heart he favoured the Thebans, or rather
placed his hopes of favouring his own caufe in that
flate ; for he well knew, that the Athenians, Spar¬
tans, and other ftates allied with Phocis, would ne¬
ver allow him to pafs Thermopylae, and lead an army
into their territories. So much refpedft, howTever, did
he ftiow to the ambafiadors from thefe ftates, parti¬
cularly Ctefiphon and Phrynon, who came from A-
thens, that they believed him to be in their intereft,
and reported as much to their mafters. The Athe-
reaches the nians, who were now diiTolved in eafe and luxury, re-
Athenians, ceive(i this news with great fatisfaflion ; and named
immediately ten plenipotentiaries to'go and treat of a
full and lafting peace with Philip. Among thefe ple¬
nipotentiaries wrere_ Demofthenes and ATchirres, the
moft celebrated orators in Athens. Philip gave di-
retlions that thefe ambaffadors fhould be treated with
the utmoft civility •, naming, at the fame time, three of
his minifters to confer with them, viz. Antipater, Par-
n enio, and Eurylochus. Demofthenes being obliged
to return to Athens, recommended it to his colleagues
not to carry on their negociations with Philip’s depu¬
ties •, but to proceed with all diligence to court, there
to confer with the king himielf. The ambaffa-
dors, however, were fo far from following his in-
ftruhlions, that they fuffered themfelves to be put off
for three months by the arts of Philip and his mini¬
fters.
In the mean time, the king took from the Athe¬
nians fuch places in Thrace as might beft cover his
frontiers ; giving their plenipotentiaries, in their Head,
abundance of fair promifes, and the ftrongeft affur-
ances that his good will ftiould be as beneficial to them
as ever their colonies had been. At laft a peace was
concluded ; but then the ratification of it was deferred
till Philip had poffeffed himfelf of Pheraer in Theffaly,
and faw himfelf at the head of a numerous army :
then he ratified the treaty •, and difmiffed the plenipo¬
tentiaries with affurances, that he would be ready at all
times to give -Vhe Athenians proofs of his friendihip.
On their return to Athens, wdien this matter came
to be debated before the people, Demofihenes plainly
told them, that, in his opinion, the promifes of Phi¬
lip ought not to be relied on, becaufe they appeared
to be of little fignificance in themfelves, and came
from a prince of fo much art, and fo little fidelity, rfat
they could derive no authority from their maker. Atf-
chmes, on. the other hand, gave it as his ientiment,
that the king of Macedon’s affurances ought to give Afacedofr.
them full fatisfaction. He faid, that for his part, —’“V"”"*
he was not politician enough to fee any thing of dif-
guife or diftimulation in the king’s conduct ; that there
was great danger in diftrufting princes •, and that the
furefl: method of putting men upon deceit was to Ihow
that wre (ufpefted them of it. The reft of the pleni¬
potentiaries concurred with Atfchines 5 and the people,
defirous of quiet, and addifted to pleafure, eaiily gave
credit to all that was faid, and decreed that the peace
flrould be kept. All this was the eafier brought about,
becaufe Phocion, the worthieft man in the repudac,
did not oppofe Philip •, which was owing to his hav.ng
a juft fenfe of the ftate his country was in. He con¬
ceived, that the Athenians of thofe times were nothing
like their anceftors; and therefore, as he exprefled
himfelf on another occafion, he was defirous, fince
they would not be at the head of Greece themfelves,
that they would at lead; be upon good terms with that
porver which would be lb. ~
Philip, who knew how to ufe as well as to procure PaiTes
opportunity, while the Athenians were in this good Thermo¬
humour, paffed Thermopylae, without their knowing Py*®’an®
whether he would fall on Phocis or Thebes ; but he p^-iarT
quickly undeceived them, by commanding his foldierswar.
to put on crowns of laurel, declaring them thereby
the troops of Apollo, and himfelf the lieutenant-gene¬
ral of that god. He then entered Phocis with an air
of triumph ; which fo terrified the Phocians, whom
he had caufed to be proclaimed facrilegious per fens,
that they immediately difmiffed all thoughts of de¬
fence, and without more ado fubmitted to his mercy.
Thus the Phocian war, which had fo long employed
all Greece, was ended without a ftroke ; and the judge¬
ment on the Phocians remitted to the Amphiftyons,
or grand council of Greece. By their decree the
walls of three Phocian cities were demoliihed, the
people were forbid to inhabit in any but villages, to pay
a yearly tribute of 60 talents, and never to make ufe
either of houfes or arms till they had repaid to the
temple of Apollo the money they had lacrilegioully
carried from thence. Their arms were taken from
them, broken to pieces, and burnt j their double voice
in the council was taken from them, and given to the
Macedonians. Other orders were made for fettling the
affairs both of religion and fiate throughout Greece :
all of which were executed by Philip with great exaeft-
nefs and moderation, he paying the moft; profound re-
fpeft to the council ; and, when be had performed its
commands, retiring peaceably with bis army back to
Macedon, which gained him great reputation.
At Athens alone, the juftice and piety of Philip was
not underftood. The people began to fee, though a
little too late, that they had been abufi d and deceived
bv thofe who had negociated the late peace. They ■
faw that, through their acceptance of it, the Phociansoppofed by
were deftroyed 5 that Philip was become mafter oDheAthe-
Thermopyhe, and might enter Greece when he plea-111^-
fed 5 that, in abandoning their allies, they had aban¬
doned themfelves •, and that, in all probability, they
might foon feel the weight of his power, whom thpy
had fo fooli(lily trufted : they therefore began to take
new and hoftile mealures ; they ordered that the wo¬
men fhould retire out of the villages into the city, their
walls be repaired, and their forts new ftrengtben-

ed. They feemed inclined to queftion Philip’s elec¬
tion into the council of the Amphi&yons, becaufe it
had been done without their confent; and even to pro¬
ceed to an open wrar. In all likelihood they had car¬
ried things to extravagancy, if Demofthenes had not
interpofed. He told them, that though he was not
for making the peace, he was however for keeping it j
and that he faw no manner of occafion for their enter¬
ing into fo unequal a conteft as would needs enfue,
if they took up arms, not only againft Philip, but
again!! all the ftates concurring with him in the late
tranfaclions. This feems to have cooled the rage of
the Athenians ; and to have brought them to think of
ruining Philip by degrees, as by degrees they had raifed
him.
The fame of his achievements without the bounds
of Macedon having difpofed the fubjecls of Philip to
hope every thing from his condu6f, and the feveral
{fates of Greece to defire above all things his friend-
fhip ; that prudent monarch laid hold of this favourable
fituation to fix his dominion on fuch a {fable founda¬
tion as that a rererfe of fortune fliould not immediate¬
ly deftroy it. To this end, while he carried on his
negociations through Greece, he likewile kept his ar¬
my in exercife, by taking feveral places in Thrace,
which terribly incommoded the Athenians. Diopi¬
thes, who had the government of the Athenian colo¬
nies in thofe parts, perceiving wrell what end Philip
had in view, did not flay for inftrudtions from home ;
but having raifed wdth much expedition a confider-
able body of troops, taking advantage of the king’s
being abfent with his army, entered the adjacent
territories of Philip, and wafted them wdth fire and
{word.
The king, who, on account of the operations of the
campaign in the Cherfonefe, wras not at leifure to re¬
pel Diopithes by force, nor indeed could divide his ar¬
my without imminent hazard, chofe, like an able gene¬
ral, rather to abandon his provinces to infults, wdiich
might be afterwards revenged, than, by following the
didates of an ill-timed paflion, to hazard the lofs of
his veteran army, wdiereon lay all his hopes. He con¬
tented himfelf, therefore, with complaining to the
Athenians of Diopithes’s condud, wTo in a time of
peace had entered his dominions, and committed fuch
devaftations as could fcarcely have been juftified in a
time of war. His partifans fupported this application
with all their eloquence. They told the Athenians,
that unlefs they recalled Diopithes, and brought him
to a trial for this infringement of the peace, they ought
not to hope either for the friendfhip of Philip or of
any other prince or ftate j neither could they juftly
complain, if, prompted by fuch a precedent, others
fhould break faith with them, and fall without the
leaft notice upon their dominions. Demofthenes de¬
fended Diopithes •, and undertook to fhow that he de¬
ferred the praife and not the cenfure of the Athenians.
Thofe of the other party began then to charge him
with crimes of a different nature 5 they alleged, that
he oppreffed the fubjedts and maltreated the allies of
Athens. Demofthenes replied, that of thefe things
there were as yet no proofs 5 that when fuch ftiould
appear, a Angle galley might be fent to bring over Dio¬
pithes to abide their judgement, but that Philip w'ould
not come if they fent a fleet: whence he inferred,

merits of this caufe before they took any refolution.’ 1 v
He faid, that it wTas true Philip had not as yet at¬
tacked Attica, or pretended to make a defcent on their
territories in Greece, or to force his w-ay into their
ports ; when it came to that, he was of opinion they
would be hardly able to defend themfelves; wherefore
he thought fuch men were to be efteemed as fought
to protect their frontiers, in order to keep Philip as
long as might be at a diftance : whereupon he moved,
that, inftead of difowming what Diopithes had done, or
direbling him to difmifs his army, they fhould fend him
over recruits, and fhow the king of Macedon they knew
how to prote£! their territories, and to maintain the dig¬
nity of their ftate, as well as their anceftors. Thefe'
arguments had- fuch an effe£t, that a decree was made
conformable to his motion.
While affairs flood thus, the Illyrians recovering
courage, and feeing Philip at fuch a diftance, haraffed
the frontiers of Macedon, and threatened a formidable
invafion : but Philip, by quick marches, arrived on
the borders of Illyricum 5 and ftruck this barbarous
people with fuch a panic, that they were glad to com¬
pound for their former depredations at the price he
was pleafed to let. Moft of the Greek cities in Thrace
now fought the friendlhip of the king, and entered in¬
to a league with him for their mutual defence. As it
cannot be fuppofed that each of thefe free cities had
a power equal to that of Philip, w-e may therefore look 62
upon him as their proteflor. About this time Philip’s Philip’s
negociations in Peloponnefus began to come to light; ^5"^
the Argives and Meffenians, growing weary of that ty- ^ L
rannical authority which the Spartans exercifed over
them, applied to Thebes for afliftanee j and the' The¬
bans, out of their natural averfion to Sparta, fought
to open a paffage for Philip into Peloponnefus, that,
in conjuntftion with them, he might humble the Lace¬
demonians. Philip readily accepted the offer ; and re-
folved to procure a decree from the Amphiftyons, di-
redling the Lacedemonians to leave Argos and Meffene
free j which if they complied not wdth, he, as the lieu¬
tenant of the Amphidlyons, might, with great appear¬
ance of juftice, march with a body ©f troops to enforce
their order. When Sparta had intelligence of this,
!he immediately applied to Athens, earneftly entreat¬
ing afliftance, as in the common caufe of Greece. The
Argives and Meffenians, on the other hand, laboured
afliduoufly to gain the Athenians to their fide ; alleging
that, if they were friends to liberty, they ought to ai-
fift thofe whofe only aim was to be free. Demofthe¬
nes, at this jundlure, outwreftled Philip, if we may
borrow that king’s expreflion j for, by a vehement ha¬
rangue, he not only determined his own citizens to be¬
come the avowed enemies of the king, but alfo made
the Argives and Meffenians not over fond of him for
an ally ; which when Philip perceived, he laid afide all
thoughts of this enterprife for the prefent, and began
to pra£life in Euboea.
This country, now called Negropont, is feparated
from Greece by the Euripus, a ftrait fo narrow, that
Euboea might eafily be united to the continent. This
fituation made Philip call it the fetters of Greece, which
he therefore fought to have in his own hands. There
had been for fome years great difturbances in that
country j under colour of which, Philip fent forces

in thofe parts, leaving the country under the govern¬
ment of three lords, whom Demofthenes roundly calls
tyrants, eltablilhed by Philip. Shortly after, the Ma¬
cedonians took Oreus, which was left under the go¬
vernment of five magiftrates, ftyled alfo tyrants at A-
thens. Thither Plutarch of Eretria, one" of the molt
eminent perfons in Euboea, went to reprefent the di-
hrelies of his country, and to implore the Athenians to
fct it free. I his luit Eemolthenes recommended wTarm-
ly to the people ; who fent thither their famous leader
Phocion, fupported by formidable votes, but a very
flender army : yet fo well did he manage the affairs of
the commonwealth and her allies, that Philip quickly
found he mult for a time abandon that proieft ; which,
however, he did not till he had formed another no lefs
beneficial to himfelf, or lefs dangerous to Athens. It
was the profecution of his conqutlls in Thrace which he
thought of pufiiing much farther than he had hitherto
done, or could be reafonably fufpe&ed to have any in¬
tention of doing.
Extraordinary preparations were made by the Ma¬
cedonian monarch for this campaign. His fon Alex¬
ander was left regent of the kingdom ; and he himfelf
with 30,000 men laid fiege to Perinthus, one of the
ilrongeft cities in the country. At prefent, however,
all his arts of cajoling and pretending friendtliip were
infufficient to, deceive the Athenians. They gave the
command of their army and fleet to Phocion ; a general
or great abilities, and with whom Philip w*ould have
found it very hard to contend. On the other hand, the
king of Perlia began to turn jealous of the growing
power of the Macedonian monarch. The Perfian kings
had been accuflomed to regard tlrofe of Macedon as
their laithful allies; but the good fortune of Philip, the
continual clamour of the Athenians againlt him, and
his dethroning at pleafure the petty princes of Thrace,
made him now regarded in another light. When
therefore he led his troops againft Perinthus, the Great
Azflg, as he was ftyled by the Greeks, fent his letters
mandatory to the governors of the maritime provinces,
directing them to fupply the place with all things in
their power ; in confequence of which they filled it
with troops, granted fubfidies in ready money, and fent
befides great convoys of provifion and ammunition. The
Byzantines alfo, fuppofing their own turn would be
next, exerted their utmofl: endeavours for the preferva-
tion of Perinthus; fending thither the flower of their
youth, vyith all other neceffaries for an obflinate de¬
fence.
*3
How he at

The confequence of all this was, that Philip
himfelf obliged to raife the fiege with great
    That the reputation of the Macedonian arms might
laft gained not fink by this difgrace, Philip made war on the Scy-
his pointy thians and Triballi, both of whom he defeated ; and
then formed a defign of invading Attica, though he
had no fleet to tranfport his troops, and knew very-
well that the Theffalians were not to be depended up¬
on if he attempted to march through the Pife, and
that the T hebans would even then be ready to oppofe
his march. To obviate all thefe difficulties, he had
recourfe to Athens itfelf; where by means of his par-
tifans, he procured his old friend AEfchines to be fent
their deputy to the Amphidlyons. This feemed a
{mall matter, and yet was the hinge on which his

ken his feat, a queftion was ftirred in the council,' v 
whether the Locrians of Amphifia had not been guilty
of facrilege in ploughing the fields of Cyrrha in the
neighbourhood of the temple of Delphi. The affembly
being divided in their opinions, iEfchines propofed to
take a view; which was according decreed. But when
the A m phi iffy on s came in order to fee how things
flood, the Locrians, either jealous of their property,
or fpurred thereto by the iuggeflions of feme w-ho
faw farther than themfelves, fell upon thofe venerable
pertons lo rudely, that they were compelled to fecure
themfelves by flight. 'I he Amphidtyons decreed, that
an army Ihould be raifed, under the command of one
of their own number, to ebaitife the delinquents; but
as this army was to be ccmpoled of troops lent from
all parts of Greece, the appearance at the rendezvous
was fo inconfiderable, that the Ampbiilyons lent to
command them durlt undertake nothing. The whole
matter being reported to the council, TEfchines, in a
long and eloquent harangue, (bowed how much the
welfare and even the fafety of Greece depended on the
deference paid to their decrees ; and after inveighing
againft the want of public fpirit in fuch as had not
fent their quotas at the time appointed by the coun¬
cil, he moved that they Ihould eledl Philip for their
general, and pray him to execute their decree. The
deputies from the other ftates, conceiving that by this
expedient their refpeftive conftituents would be free
irom any farther trouble or expence, came into it at
once ; whereupon a decree was immediately drawn up,
purporting that ambaffadors Ihould be fent to Philip’
of Macedon, in the name of Apollo and the Amphic-
tyons, once more to require his affiftance, and to no¬
tify to him, that the ftates of Greece had unanimoufly
chofen him their general, with full power to a£t as he
thought fit againft fuch as had oppofed the authority
of the Amphiftyons. Thus of a fudden Philip ac-T ,6f
quired all that he fought ; and having an army ready jreneral by
in expectation of this event, he immediately marched the Arn-
to execute the commands of the AmphiCtyons in ap-PhiAyon*
pearance, but in reality to accomplilh his own de-
figns : For having paired into Greece with his army,
inftead of attacking the Locrians, he feized immedi¬
ately upon Elatea, a great city of Phocis upon the river
Cephifus.
The Athenians in the mean time were in the utmoftIs 0)!p^feci
confufion on the news of Philip’s march. However,by the A-
by the advice of Demofthenes, they invited the The-Fenians
bans to join them againft the common enemy of Greece.an<*
Philip endeavoured as much as poffible to prevent thisbanS’
confederacy from taking place ; but all his efforts pro¬
ved ineffeCfual. The Athenians raifed an army, which
marched immediately to Eleufis, where they were join¬
ed by the Thebans. The confederates made the bell
appearance that had- ever been feen in Greece, and the
troops were exceedingly good ; but unfortunately the
generals were men of no conduft or Ikill in the mili¬
tary art. An engagement enfued at Cheron^a; where-who^6.e
in Alexander commanded one wing of the Macedonian defers at
army, and his father Philip the other. 'The confede- Cheromea.
rate army was divided according to the different na¬
tions of which it confifted ; the Athenians having the
right and the Boeotians the left. In the beginning
of the battle the confederates had the better; 'where¬

from this time we muft reckon Philip fupreme lord of
all the Grecian dates. The firft ufe he made of his
power wTas to convoke a general affembly, wherein he
was recognized generaliffimo, and with full power ap¬
pointed their leader againft the Perflans. Having, by
virtue of his authority, fettled a general peace among
them, and appointed the quota that each of the dates
fliould furnilh for the war, he difmiffed them : and re¬
turning to Macedon, began to make great prepara¬
tions for this new expedition. His pretence for ma¬
king war on the Perflans at this time was the affiflance
given by the Perflans to the city of Perinthus, as al¬
ready mentioned. In the mean time, however, the
king by reafon of the diffenfipns which reigned in his
family, was made quite miferable. He quarrelled with
his wife Olympias to fuch a degree, that he divorced
her, and married another woman named Cleopatra.
This produced a quarrel between him and his Ion A-
lexander ■, which alfo came to fuch a height, that A-
lexander retired into Epirus with his mother. Some
time afterwards, however, he was recalled, and a re¬
conciliation took place in appearance 5 but in the mean
time a confpiracy was formed againft the king’s life,
the circumftances and caufes of which are very much
unknown. Certain it is, however, that it took effeff,
as the king was exhibiting certain (hows in honour of
his daughter’s marriage wdth the king of Epirus. Phi¬
lip, having given a public audience to the ambaffadors
of Greece, went next day in date to the theatre. All
the feats were early taken up ; and the (hows began
with ,a fplendid proceffion, wherein the images of the
12 fuperior deities of Greece were carried, as alfo the
image of Philip, habited in like manner, as if he now
made the 13th, at which the people (houted aloud.
Then came the king alone, in a wffiite robe, crowned,
with his guards at a confiderable diftance, that the
Greeks might fee he placed his fafety only in his con¬
fidence of the loyalty of his fubjefts. Paufanias, the
affaffin, however, had fixed himfelf clofe by the d^or
of the theatre ; and ohferving that all things fell out
as he had forefeen they wmuld, took his “opportunity
when the king drew near him, and plunging- his fword
in his left fide, laid him dead at his feet. He then fled
as faft as he was able towards the place where his
horfes were ; and would have efcaped, had not the
twig of a vine catched his (hoe and thrown him down.
This gave time to fhofe who purfued him to come up
with him ; but inftead of fecuring him, in order to ex-
his life. _ .
With regard to the charafter of this monarch, itfiisclia-
appears certain, that he was one of the moft eminent rafter,
perfons that ever fat on a throne. Had he lived for
fome time longer, he would in all probability have
fubdued the Perflans : wffiich was in truth lefs difficult
than what he had already done. “ Had that event
taken place (fays Dr Gillies), the undertakings of his
long and fuccefsful reign would have been ennobled and
illuminated by the fplendour of extenfive foreign con-
queft. Philip would have reached the height of fuch
renown as is obtained by the habits of activity, vigi¬
lance, and fortitude, in the purfuit of unbounded great-
nefs 5 and in the opinion of poilerity, would perhaps
have furpaffed the glory of all kings and conquerors
who either preceded or followed him. Yet, even on
this fuppofition, there is not any man of fenfe and
probity, who, if he allows himfelf time for ferious re-
fteftion, would purchafe the imagined grandeur and
profperity of the king of Macedon at the price of his
artifices and his crimes •, and to a philolopHer, who
confidered either the means by which he had obtained
his triumphs, or the probable confequences of his domi¬
nion over Greece and Afia, the bufy ambition of this
mighty conqueror would appear but a deceitful feene
of fplendid mifery.” 70
No fooner did the news of Philip’s death reach A - Extrava-
thens, than, as if all danger had been part, the inhabi-S^J0^
tants (bowed the moft extravagant figns of joy. De-then'iansJ
mofthenes and his party put on chaplets of flowers, and
behaved as if they had gained a great viftory. Pho-
cion reproved them for this madnefs j bidding them
remember, that “ the army which had beaten them at
CheronEea was leffened but by one.” This reproof,
however, had very little effedft. The people heard with
pleafure all the harftr things which the orators could
fay of the young Alexander king of Macedon, whom
they reprefented as a giddy wrong-headed boy, ready
to grafp all things in bis imagination, and able to per¬
form nothing. The affairs of Macedon indeed were
in a very diftrafted date on the accefllon of Alexander:
for all the neighbouring nations had the fame notion
of the young king with the Athenians ; and being ir¬
ritated by the ufurpations of Philip, immediately re¬
volted •, and the dates of Greece entered into a con¬
federacy againft him. The Perfians had been con¬
triving to transfer the war into Macedon ; but as foon
as the news of Philip’s death reached them, they be¬
haved as if all danger had been over. At the fame
time Attains, one of the Macedonian commanders,
afpired to the crown, and fought to draw off the fol¬
diers from their allegiance.
In the councils held on this occafton, Alexander’s
bell friends advifed him rather to make ufe of diffimu-
lation than force, and to cajole thofe whom they
thought he could not fubdue. Thefe advices, how¬
ever, were ill fuited to the temper of their monarch.
He thought that vigorous meafllres only were proper,
and therefore immediately led his army into Theffaly. 71
Here he harangued the princes fo effeftually, that he
thoroughly gained them over to his intereft, and was generai 0£-
by them declared general of Greece \ upon which he Greece,
returned to Macedon, where he caufed Attalus to be
feized and put to death.

and the inhabitants were for fome hours maffacred with¬
out diftin£Hon of age or fex •, after which the houfes
were demolifhed, all except that of Pindar the famous

Alexander himfelf failed from Eleus j and when he
was in the middle of the Hellefpont, offered a bull to
Neptune and the Nereids, pouring forth at the fame

near the Ihore, he launched a javelin, which ftuck in

that they Ihould burn and deftroy all the country
round, that they might deprive the Greeks of the means
of fubfirting, and then tranfport a part of their army
into Macedon. But the Perfians, depending on their
cavalry^rejected this falutary advice; and ported them-
felves along the river Granicus, in order to wait the
arrival of Alexander. In the engagement which hap¬
pened on the banks of that river, the Perfians were
defeated f, and Alexander became mafter of all the
neighbouring country ; which he immediately began to
take care of, as if it had been part of his hereditary
dominions. The city of Sardis was immediately de¬
livered up ; and here Alexander built a temple to Ju-
firft victory, piter Olympius. After this, he reftored the Ephefians
to their liberty ; ordered the tribute which they for¬
merly paid to the Perfians to be applied towards the
rebuilding the magnificent temple of Diana : and
having fettled the affairs of the city, marched againrt
Miletus. This place was defended by Memnon with a
confiderable body of troops who had fled thither af¬
ter the battle of Granicus, and therefore made a vigo¬
rous refiflance. The fortune of Alexander, however,
prevailed; and the city was loon reduced, though
Memnon with part of the troops efcaped to Halicar-
naffus. After this, the king difmiffed his fleet, for
which various reafons have been afligned ; though it
is probable, that the chief one was to Ihow his army
that their only refource now was in fubverting the Per-
fian empire.
Almoft all the cities betw-een Miletus and Halicar-
naffus fubmitted as fobn as they heard that the former
was taken •, but Halicarnaffus, where Memnon com-
' manded with a very numerous garrifon, made an oblti-
nate defence. Nothing, however, was able to refirt;
the Macedonian army. Memnon was at laft obliged
to abandon the place ; upon which Alexander took
and razed the city of Tralles in Phrygia; received the
fubmiflion of feveral princes tributary to the Perfians ;
and having deftroyed the Marmarians, a people of Ly-
cia who had fallen upon the rear of his army, put an
end to the campaign ; after which he fent home all
the new married men ; in obedience, it wrould feem,
to a precept of the Mofaic law, and wrhich endeared
him more to his foldiers than any other adrtion of his
life.
As foon as the feafon would permit, Alexander
quitted the province of Phafelus ; and having fent part
of his army through the mountainous country to
Perga, by a Ihort but difficult road, took his route by
a certain promontory, where the way is altogether im-
paffable, except when the north winds blow. At the
time of the king’s march the fouth wind had held for
a long time ; but of a fudden it changed, and blew from
the north fo violently, that, as he and his followers
declared, they obtained a fafe and eafy paffage through
the Divine affiftance. By many this march is held to
be miraeffous, and compared to that of the children
of Ifrael through the Red fea; while, on the other
fcand, it is the opinion of others, that there was no¬
thing at all extraordinary in it. He continued his
march towards Gordium, a city of Phrygia ; the ene¬
my having abandoned the ftrong pafs of Telmiffus,
through which it w7as neceffary for him to march. IVTacarkm.
When he arrived at Gordium, and found himfelf un-
der a neceffity of flaying fome time there till the fe¬
veral corps of his army could be united, he expreffed
a ftrong defire of feeing Gordius’s chariot, and the fa¬
mous knot in the harnefs, of which fuch ftrange ftories
had been publithed to the world. The cord in which
this knot was tied, was made of the inner rind of
the cornel tree ; and no eye could perceive where it 78
had begun or ended. Alexander, when he could find Unties the
no poffible way of untying, and yet was unwilling po;<han
to leave it tied left it ftiould caufe fome fears in the ‘
breafts of his faldiers, is faid by fome authors to have
cut the cords with his fword, faying, “ It matters not
how it is un lone.” But Ariftobulus affures us, that
the king wrefted a wooden pin out of the beam of the
waggon, which, being driven in acrofs the beam, held
it up; and fo took the yoke from under it. Be this
as it will, however, Arrian informs us, that a great
tempefl: of thunder, lightning, and rain, happening the
fuccQjeding night, it was held declarative of the true
folution of this knot, and that Alexander fhould be¬
come lord of Afia.
The king having left Gordium, marched towards
Cilicia ; where he was attended with his ufual good
fortune, the Perfians abandoning all the ftrong paffes
as he advanced. As foon as he entered the province,
he received advice that Arfames, whom Darius had
made governor of Tarfus, was about to abandon it,
and that the inhabitants were very apprehenfive that
he intended to plunder them before he withdrew. To
prevent this, the king marched inceffantly, and arrived 79
juft in time to fave the city. But his faving it had His ficknefe
well nigh coft him his life: for, either through theaiu*reco'
exceffive fatigue of marching, as fome fay, or, accord-Vl"‘''
ing to others, by his plunging when very hot into the
river Cydnus, which, as it runs through thick ftiades,
has its waters exceffively cold, he fell into fuch adiftem-
per as threatened his immediate diffolution. His army
loft their fpirits immediately ; the generals knew not
what to do ; and his phyficians were fo much affrighted,
that the terror of his death hindered them from ufing
the neceffary methods for preferving his life.- Philip
the Acarnanian alone preferved temper enough to exa¬
mine the nature of the king’s difeafe ; the worft fymp—
tom of which was a continual waking, and which he
took off by means of a potion, and in a ftiort time the
king recovered his ufual health.
Soon after Alexander’s recovery, he received the
agreeable news that Ptolemy and Afander had defeated
the Perfian generals, and made great conquefts on the
Hellefpont; a little after that, he met the Perfian army
at Iffus, commanded by Darius himfelf. A bloody
engagement enfued, in which the Perfians were de¬
feated with great flaughter, as related under the article
Issus. The confequences of this vi<ftory-were verv
advantageous to the Macedonians. Many governors
of provinces and petty princes fubmitted themfelves to
the conqueror ; and fuch as did .fo were treated, not as
a newly conquered people, but as his old hereditary
fubje&s; being neither burdened with foldiers nor
oppreffed with tribute. Among the number of thole
places which, within a (hort fpace after the battle of
Iffus, fent deputies to fubmit to the conqueror, was
the city of Tyre. The king, whole name was Azel-

micus, was abfcnt in the Perfian fleet j but his fon was
among the deputies, and was very favourably received
by Alexander. The king probably intended to confer
particular honours on the city of Tyre ; for he ac¬
quainted the inhabitants that he would come and fa-
crifice to the Tyrian Hercules, the patron of their
city, to whom they had erefted a moft magnificent
temple. But thefe people, like moft other1-trading
nations, were too fufpicious to think of admitting
fuch an enterprifing prince with his troops within
their walls. They fent therefore their deputies again
to him, to inform him, that they were ready to do
whatever he fhould command them ; but, as to his
coming and facrificing in their city, they could not
confent to that, but were pofitively determined not to
admit a fingle Macedonian within their gates. Alex¬
ander immediately difmiffed their deputies in great dif-
pleafure. He then affembled a council of war, wherein
he infifted flrongly on the difaffecled date of Greece
(for molt of the .Grecian ftates had fent ambaffadors
to Darius, to enter into a league with him againft the
Macedonians), the power of the Perfians by fea, and
the folly of carrying on the war in diftant provinces,
while Tyre w’as left unreduced behind them : he alfo
remarked, that if once this city was fubdued, the fo-
vereignty of the fea would be transferred to them, be-
caufe it would fix their poffeffion of the coafts; and
as the Perfian fleet was compofed chiefly of tributary
fquadrons, thofe tributaries would fight the battles,
not of their late, but of their prefent mailers. For
thefe reafons the fiege of Tyre was refolved on. The
town was not taken, however, without great difliculty ;
which provoked Alexander to fuch a degree, that he
treated the inhabitants with the greateft crueltv. See
Tyre.
After the reduflion of Tyre, Alexander, though the
feafon was already far advanced, refolved to make an
expedition into Syria ; and in his way thither propofed
to chaftife the Jews, who had highly offended him dur¬
ing the fiege of Tyre : for when he fent to them to de¬
mand provifions for his foldiers, they anfwered, That
they were the fubjects of Darius, and bound by oath
not to fupply his enemies. The king, however, was
pacified by their fubmiflion 5 and not only pardoned
them, but conferred many privileges upon them, as re¬
lated under the article Jews.
From Jerufalem Alexander marched diredlly to Gaza,
the only place in that part of the world which Hill
held out for Darius. This was a very large and
Prong city, fituated on a high hill, about five miles
from the fea-lhore. One Bails or Belts, an eunuch,
had the government of the place ; and had made every
preparation neceffary for fuftaining a long and obfti-
nate fiege. The governor defended the place with
great valour, and feveral times repulfed his enemies;
but at laft it was taken by ftorm, and all the garri-
fon flain to a manj and this fecured to Alexander an
entrance into Egypt, which having before been very im¬
patient of the Perfian yoke, admitted the Macedonians
peaceably.
Here the king laid the foundations of the city of
Alexandria, which for many years after continued to
be the capital of the country. While he remained
here, he alfo formed the extraordinary delign of vilit-
ing the temple of Jupiter Ammon. As to the mo-

nary journey, authors are not agreed ; but certain it' v 
is, that he hazarded himfelf and his troops in the high-
eft degree j there being two dangers in this march,
which, with the example of Cambyfes, who loft the*
greateft part .of his army in it, might have terrified any
body but Alexander. The firft was the want of water
which, in the fandy deferts furrounding the temple, is
nowhere to be found ; the other, the uncertainty of the
road from the flu&uation of the fands ; which chan¬
ging their fttuation every moment, leave the traveller
neither a road to walk in nor mark to march by. Thefe
difficulties, however, Alexander got over; though not
without a miraculous interpofition, as is pretended bv all
his hiftorians.
Alexander having confulted the oracle, and received
a favourable anfwer, returned to purfue his conquefts.
Having fettled the government of Egypt, he appointed
the general rendezvous of his forces at Tyre. Here he
met with ambalfadors from Athens, requefting him to
pardon fuch of their countrymen as he found ferving
the enemy. The king, being defirous to oblige fuch a
famous ftate, granted their requeft 5 and fent alfo a fleet
to the coaft of Greece, to prevent the effefts of fome
commotions which had lately happened in Peloponnelus.
He then direfted his march to Thapfacus 5 and having
paffed the Euphrates and Tigris, met with Darius near
Arbela, where the Perfians were again overthrown with
prodigious flaughter f, and Alexander in effieft became f See Ar-
mafter of the Perfian empire.
After this important vidtory, Alexander marched di-Red^es
redlly to Babylon, which was immediately delivered Babylon*,
up 5 the inhabitants being greatly difaffe&ed to the Sufa, and
Perfian intereft. After 30 days ftay in this country,Pebepolis,
the king marched to Sufa, which had already furren-
dered to Philoxenus; and here he received the trea-
fures of the Perfian monarch, amounting, according
to the moft generally received account, to 50,000 ta¬
lents. Having received alfo at this time a lupply of
6000 foot and 500 horfe from Pvlacedon, he fet about
reducing the nations of Media, among whom Darius
was retired. He firft reduced the JJxians, and having
forced a paffage to Perfepolis the capital of the empire,
he like a barbarian deflroyed the ftately palace there, a
pile of building not to be equalled in any part of the
world 5 after having given up the city to be plundered
by his foldiers. In the palace he found 120,000 talents,
which he appropriated to his own ufe, and caufed im¬
mediately to be carried away upon mules and camels ;
lor he had fuch an extreme averfion to the inhabitants
©r Peifepolis, that he determined to leave nothing va¬
luable in the city.
During the time that Alexander remained at Per¬
fepolis, he received intelligence that Darius remained
at Ecbatana the capital of Media; upon which he 54
purfued him with the greateft expedition, marching He puifues
at the rate of near 40 milts a-day In 15 days he U“rius >
reached Ecbatana, where he was? informed that Da¬
rius had retired from thence five days before, with an
intent to pafs into the remoteft provinces of his em¬
pire. This put fome ftop to the rapid progrefs of the
Macedonian army •, and the king, perceiving that there
was no neceffity for hurrying himfelf and his foldiers
in fuch a manner, began to give the orders requiiite
in the prefent fituation of his affairs. The Th&fialian
horfe,
MAC [ 31
Macedon. liorfe, wlio had deferved exceedingly well of him in all
   his battles, he difmiiTed according to his agreement ;
gave them their whole pay, and ordered 2000 talents
over and above to be diftributed among them. He
then declared that he would force no man : but if any
were willing to ferve him longer for pay, he de-
lired they would enter their names in a book, which
a great many of them did j the reft fold their horfes,
and prepared for their departure. The king appointed
Epocillus to conduft them to the fea, and alfigned him
a body of horfe as an efcort : he like wife fent Menetes
with them, to take care of their embarkation, and that
they were fafely landed in Eubcea without any expence
to themfelves.
On receiving frefh information concerning the ftate
of Darius’s affairs, the king fet out again in purfuit
of him, advancing as far as Rhages, a city one day’s
journey from the Cafpian fl rails : there he under [food
that Darius had paffed thofe ftraits fome time before ;
which information leaving him again without hopes,
he halted for five days. Oxidates, a Perfian whom Da¬
rius had left prifoner at Sufa, was made governor of
Media, while the king departed on an expedition into
Parthia. The Cafpian ftraits he paffed irmnediately
without opposition •, and then gave directions to his of¬
ficers to colled: a quantity of provifions fufficient to
ferve his army on a long march through a tvafted coun¬
try. But before his officers could accomplifh thofe
commands, the king received intelligence that Darius
had been murdered by Beffus, one of his own fubje&s,
and governor of Badria, as is related at length under
the article Persia.
As foon as Alexander had colleCled his forces to¬
gether, and fettled the government of Parthia, he
entered Hyrcania j and having, according to his ufual
cuftom, committed the greateft part of his army to
the care of Craterus, he, at the head of a choice
body of troops, paffed through certain craggy roads,
and before the arrival of Craterus, who took an open
and eafy path, ftruck the whole provinces with fuch
terror, that all the principal places w7ere immediately
put into his hands, and foon after the province of Aria
alfo fubmitted, and the king continued Satibarzanes
the governor in his employment.—The redudion of
this province finilhed the conqueft of Perfia ; but the
ambition of Alexander to become matter of every na¬
tion of which he had the leaft intelligence, induced
him to enter the country of the Mardi, merely be-
caufe its rocks and barrennefs bad hitherto hindered
any body from conquering, or indeed from attempt¬
ing to conquer it. This conqueft, however, he eafily
accomplifhed, and obliged the whole nation to fub-
mit to bis pleafure. But in the mean time difturbances
began to arife in Alexander’s new empire, and among
Ins troops, wftiich all his adivity could not thorough¬
ly fupprefs. He had fcarcely left the province of Aria,
when he received intelligence, that the traitor Beffus
had caufed himfelf to be proclaimed king of Afia by
the name of Artaxerxes; and that Satibarzanes bad
joined him, after having maffacred all the Macedonians
who had been left in the province. Alexander ap¬
pointed one Arfames governor in the room of Satibar¬
zanes 5 and marched thence wuth his army againft the
Zarangce, who, under the command of Bafzaentes, one
of thofe who had confpired againft Darius, had taken up

arms, and threatened to make an obftinate defence. Macedoa. ^
But their numbers daily falling off, Barzaentes being U‘
afraid they would purchafe their own fafety at the ex¬
pence of his, privately withdrew from his camp, and,
crofting the river Indus, fought fhelter among the na¬
tions beyond it. But they, either dreading the poiver
of Alexander, or detefting the treachery of this Perfian
towards his former mafter, feized and delivered him up
to Alexander, ivho caufed him immediately to be put
to death. 87
The immenfe treafure which the Macedonians had The Macc-
acquired in the conqueft of Perfia began now to cor-cH>mai?s
rupt them. The king himfelf was of a moft generous fejves Upt0
difpofition, and liberally bellowed his gifts on thofe luxury,
around him •, but they made a bad ufe of his bounty,
and fooliftily indulged in thofe vices by which the for¬
mer poffeffors of that wealth had loft it. The king did
all in his powrer to difcourage the lazy and inr-'tive'
pride which now began to fhow itfelf among his of¬
ficers } but neither his difcourfes nor his example had
any confiderable effiedh The manners of his courtiers
from bad became worfe, in fpite of all he could fay
or do to prevent it; and at laft they proceeded to
cenfure his condufl, and to exprefs themfelves with
fome bitternefs on the fubjeft of his long continuance
of the wrar, and his leading them confiantly from one
labour to another. This came to fuch a height, that
the king was at laft obliged to ufe fome feverity, in' or¬
der to keep his army wuthin the limits of their duty. 88
From this time forward, however, Alexander himfelf Alexander
began to alter his conduft ; and by giving a little *n_ ^he^PeTfian
to the cuftoms of the Orientals, endeavoured to fe-cuftoms,
cure that obedience from his new fubjecls which he
found fo difficult to be preferved among his old ones.
He likexvife endeavoured, by various methods, to blend
the cuftoms of the Afiatics and the Greeks. The
form of his civil government refembled that of the
ancient Perfian kings: in the military affairs hcwr-
ever, he preferved the Macedonian difeipline j but
then he made choice of 30,000 boys out of the pro¬
vinces, whom he caufed to be inftrudled in the Greek
language, and direfted to be brought up in fuch a
manner as that from time to time he might with them
fill up the phalanx. The Macedonians faw with great
concern thefe extraordinary meafures, which fuited
very ill with their grofs underftandings j for they
thought, after all the vitffories they had gained, to be
abfolute lords of Afia, and to poffefs not only the riches
of its inhabitants, but to rule the inhabitants them¬
felves : whereas they now faw, that Alexander meant
no fuch thing •, but that, on the contrary, he con¬
ferred governments, offices at court, and all other
marks of confidence and favour, indifcrimihately both
on Greeks and Perfians.—From this time alfo the
king feems to have given inftances of a cruelty he
had never ffiown before. Philotas his moft intimate
friend was feized, tortured, and put to death for a
confpiracy of which it could never be proved that he
was guilty •, and foon aYter Parmenio and fome others
were executed without any crime at all real or al-
ledged. Thefe things very much difturbed the army.
Some of them wrote home to Macedon of the king’s
fufpicions of his friends, and his difpofition to hunt
cut enemies at the very extremities of the world. A-
lexander having intercepted fome of thefe letters, and
procured i
MAC [ 3
1 Mru crlon, procured the beft in Formation he could concerning
v' ^ their authors, picked out thefe diffatisfied people, and
having difpofed them into a corps, gave it the title
of the turbulent battalion; hoping by this means to
prevent the fpirit of difaffedtion from pervading the
whole army.
As a farther precaution againft any future confpira-
cy, Alexander thought fit to appoint Hephaeflion and
Clytus generals of the auxiliary horfe ; being appre-
henfive, that if this authority was lodged in the hands
of a fingle perfon, it might prompt him to dangerous
undertakings, and at the fame time furnifli him with
the means of carrying them into execution. To keep
his forces in aftion, he fuddenly marched into the coun¬
try of the Euergetse, i. e. Benefaclors ; and found them
full of that kind and hofpitable difpofition for which
that name had been bellowed on their anceftors : he
therefore treated them with great refpedl *, and at his
departure added fome lands to their dominions, w’hich
lay contiguous, and which for that reafon they had re-
quefted of him.
Furning then to the eafl, he entered Arachofia, the
inhabitants of which fubmitted without giving him any
trouble. While he pafled the winter in thefe parts,
the king received advice, that the Arians, whom he
had fo lately fubdued, were again up in arms, Sati-
barzanes being returned into that country with two
thoufand horfe afligned him by Beflus. Alexander in-
flantly defpatched Artabazus the Perfian, with Erigyus
and Caranus, two of his commanders, with a confi-
derable body of horfe and foot; he likewife ordered
Sj> Phrataphernes, to whom he had given the govern-
Satibarza- ment of Parthia, to accompany them. A general
nes defeat- engagement enfued, wdierein the Arians behaved ve-
Vd'11^ ry we^J as long as their commander Satibarzanes lived ;
but he engaging Erigyus, the Macedonian flruck
him firfl into the throat, and then, drawing forth
his fpear again, through the mouth ; fo that he im¬
mediately expired, and with him the courage of his
foldiers, who inftantly began to fly 5 whereupon Alex¬
ander’s commanders made an eafy conqueft of the reft
of the country, and fettled it effedlually under his obe¬
dience.
The king, notwithftanding the inclemency of the
feafon, advanced into the country of Paropamifus, fo
-called from the mountain Paropamifus, which the fol¬
diers of Alexander called Caucafus. Having crofled
the country in x 6 days, he came at length to an open¬
ing leading into Media} which finding of a fufficient
breadth, he direfted a city to be built there, which
he called Alexandria, as alfo feveral other towns about
a day’s journey diftant from thence . and in thefe
places he left 7000 perfons, part of them fuch as had
hitherto followed his camp, and part of the mercenary
foldiers, v.'ho, wTeary of continual fatigue, were con¬
tent to dwell there. Having thus fettled things in
this province, facrificed folemnly to the gods, and ap¬
pointed Proexes the Perfian prefident thereof with a
fmall body of troops under the command of Niloxenus
to aflift him, he refumed his former defign of penetrat¬
ing into Badlria.
Befius, who had affumed the title of Artaxerxes,
when he was affured that Alexander was marching
tow-ards him, immediately began to wafte all the coun¬
try between Paropamifus and the river Oxus 5 which

the veflels he had made ufe of for tranfportinT them ~—v—
retiring to Nautaca, a city of Sogdia; fully perfuad-
ed, that, by the precautions he had taken, Alexander
would be compelled to give over his purfuit. This
conduft of his, however, difheartened his troops, and
gave the lie to all his pretenlions; for he had affefted
to cenfure Darius’s conduft, and had charged him
with cowardice, in not defending the rivers Euphrates
and Tigris, whereas he now quitted the banks of the
moft defenfible river perhaps in the wdiole world. As
to his hopes, though it cannot be faid they were ill
founded, yet they proved abfolutely vain j for Alexan¬
der, continuing his march, notwithftanding all the hard-
ftiips^ his foldiers fuftained, reduced all Badtria under his
obedience, particularly the capital Badlria and the ftrong
caftle Aornus: in the latter he placed a garrifon under
the command of Archelaus; but the government of
the province he committed to Artabazus. He then
continued his march to the river Oxus : on the banks
of xvhich when he arrived, he found it three quarters of
a mile over, its depth more than proportionable to
its breadth, its bottom fandy, its ftream fo rapid as to
render it almoft unnavigable, and neither boat nor tree
in its neighbourhood ; lb that the ableft commanders
in the Macedonian army wrere of opinon that they
fhould be obliged to march back. The king, however,
having firft fent away, under a proper efcort, all his
infirm and worn-out foldiers, that they might be con¬
duced fafe to the fea-ports, and from thence to Greece,
devifed a method of palling this river without either
boat or bridge, by cauiing the hides which covered the
foldiers tents and carriages to be Hulled with llraw, and
then tied together, and thrown into the river. Having
crofted the Oxus, he marched direCly towards the camp
of Beffus, where, when he arrived, he found it abandon¬
ed ; but received at the fame time letters from Snita-
menes and Dataphernes, who were the chief comman¬
ders under Befliis, lignifying, that, if he would fend a
fmall party to receive Beffus, they would deliver him
into his hands 4 which they did accordingly, and the
traitor was put to death in the manner related in the
hiftory of Persia.
A fupply of horfes being now arrived, the Mace¬
donian cavalry were remounted. Alexander continued
his march to Maracanda the capital of Sogdia, from
whence he advanced to the river laxartes. Here he
performed great exploits againft the Scythians ; from
whom, however, though he overcame them, his army
luffered much j and the revolted Sogdians being headed
by Spitamenes, gave him a great deal of trouble. Here Alexander
he married Roxana the daughter of Oxyartes, a prince marries
of the country whom he had fubdued. But duringRoxana'
tbefe expeditions, the king greatly difgufted his army by
the murder of his friend Clytus in a drunken quarrel at
a banquet, and by his extravagant vanity in claiming di¬
vine honours.
At lafted he arrived at the river Indus, where Hephas- Paffesthe
ftion and Perdiccas had already provided a bridge ofIn^ius•
boats for the paflage of the army. The king refrelhed
his troops for 30 days in the countries on the other fide
of the river, which were thofe of his friend and ally
Taxiles, who gave him 30 elephants, and joined his ar¬
my now with 700 Indian horfe, to which, when they

foot,
MAC f •
Macedon. foot. The true reafon of this feems to have been his
i“—v~—,; enmity to Porus, a famous Indian prince whofe terri¬
tories lay on the other lide of the river Plydafpes.
During this recefs, the king facrificed with great fo-
lemnity •, receiving alfo ambaffadors from Ambifurus,
a very potent prince, and from Doxareas, who was
likewife a king in thofe parts, with tenders of their
duty, and confiderable prefents. Thefe ceremonies over,
Alexander appointed Philip governor of Taxila, and
put a Macedonian garrifon into the place, becaufe he
intended to erefl an hofpital there for the cure of his
fick and wounded foldiers. He then ordered the vef-
fels, of which his bridge had been compofed when he
paifed the Indus, to be taken to pieces, that they might
be brought to the Hydafpes, where he was informed
that Porus with a great army lay encamped to hinder his
pafiage. When he approached the banks of this river
with his army and the auxiliaries under the command
of Taxiles, he found that the people he had to do with
were not fo eafily to be fubdued as the Perfians and
other Afiatics. The Indians were not only a very tall
and robuft, but alfo a very hardy and well difciplined
people ; and their king Porus was a prince of high fpirit,
invincible courage, and great conduff.
It was about the fummer folftice when Alexander
reached the Hydafpes, and confequently its waters
were broader, deeper, and more rapid, than at any
other time ; for in India the rivers fwell as the fun’s
increafing heat melts the fnow, and fubfide again as
winter approaches. Alexander therefore had every dif¬
ficulty to ftruggle with. Porus had made his difpofi-
tions fo judicioufly, that Alexander found it impoffible
to pradlife upon him as he had done upon others, and
to pafs the river in this view : wherefore he was con-
11 rained to divide his army into fmall parties, and to
praftife other arts, in order to get the better of fo vi¬
gilant a prince. To this end he caufed a great quan¬
tity of corn and other provifions to be brought into
his camp •, giving out, that he intended to remain where
he was till the river fell, and by becoming fordable
fhould give him an opportunity of forcing a paffage :
this did not, however, hinder Porus from keeping up
very ftrift difcipline in his camp j which when Alex¬
ander perceived, he frequently made filch motions as
feemed to indicate a change of his refolution, and that
he had Hill thoughts of palling the river. The main
thing the Macedonians flood in fear of were the ele¬
phants ; for the bank being pretty fleep on the other
fide, and it being the nature of horfes to ftart at the firft
appearance of thofe animals, it was forefeen that the
army wrould be difordered, and incapable of fuftaining
the charge of Porus’s troops.
At length Alexander paffed the river by the follow¬
ing contrivance. There was, at the diftance of 150
fladia from his camp, a rocky promontory proje<51ing
into the river, thick covered with wood ; and over-
againft this promontory there lay a pretty large unin¬
habited illand almoft overgrowm with trees. The king
therefore conceived within himfelf a pr6jecl of convey¬
ing a body of troops from this promontory into that
illand; and upon this fcheme he built bis hopes of fur-
prifing Porus, vigilant as he was. To this end he kept
him and his army conflantly alarmed for many nights
together, till he perceived that Porus apprehended it
was only done to harafs his troops, and therefore no

longer drew out of his camp, but trufled to his orJi-
nary guards : then Alexander refolved to put his delign
in execution. A confiderable body of horfe, the Ma¬
cedonian phalanx, with fome corps of light-armed
foot, he left in his camp under the Command of Cra-
terus, as alfo the auxiliary Indians, giving thefe orders,
to be obferved in his abfence, that if Porus marched
againfl him with part of his army, and left another part
with the elephants behind in his camp, Craterus and
his forces Ihould remain where they were ; but if it fo
happened that Porus withdrew his elephants, then Cra¬
terus was to pafs the river, becaufe his cavalry might
then do it fafely. Alexander having marched half the
wTay, or about nine of our miles, ordered the merce¬
nary troops under the command of Attalus and other
generals, to remain there 5 and direfted them, that as
loon as they knew he was engaged with the Indians
on the other fide, they Ihould pafs in veffels provided
for that purpofe, in order to alfift him. Then march¬
ing a long way about, that the enemy might not per¬
ceive his defign of reaching the rock, lie advanced as
diligently as he could towards that poll. It happened
very fortunately for him, that a great ftorm of thun¬
der, lightning, and hail, rofe in the night, whereby
his march was perfectly concealed, his veffels of 30
oars put together, and his tents fluffed and Hitched, fo
that they palled from the rock into the itland, without
being perceived, a little before break of day j the
ftorm ceafing juft as he and his foldiers wrere ready for
their paffage. When they had traverfed the illand, they
boldly fet forward to gain the oppofite Ihore in fight of
Porus’s outguards, who inftantly polled away to give
their mailer an account of the attempt. Alexander
landed firft himfelf, and w’as followed as expeditioully
as poffible by his forces, whom he took care to draw
up as fall as they arrived. When they began their
march again, they found that their good fortune wras
not fo great as at firft they eileemed it j for it appeared
now7, that they had not reached the continent at all, but
were in truth in another illand much larger than the
former. They croffed it as fall as they could, and
found that it w7as divided from the terra Jlrma by a
narrow channel, which, hovvever, was fo fvvelled by the
late heavy rain, that the poor foldiers were obliged to
wade up to the breaft. When they were on the other
fide, the king drew7 them up again carefully, ordering
the foot to march Howdy, they being in number about
6000, while himfilf with 5000 borfe advanced before.
As foon as Porus received intelligence that Alexander
was actually paffing the river, he lent his fon with 2000
hoife and 120 armed chariots, to oppofe him. But they
came too late : Alexander was already got on fhore,
and even on his march.
When the Macedonian fcouts perceived them  .^1
vance, they informed the king, who fent a detachment Porus de-
to attack them, remaining ftill at the head of his ca- *e.atcd and
valry in expe&ation of Porus. But when he found kilkd‘
that this party was unfupported, he inftantly attack¬
ed with all his horfe, and defeated them with the
Daughter of many, and the lofs of all their armed
chariots, the fon of Porus being llain in the fight.
I he remainder of the horfe returning to the camp with
tins difaftrous account, Porus was in fome confufion :
however, he took very quickly the belt and vifeft re-
foiulions his circumftances wrould allow7: which were,

MAC [31
Macp.-Ton to leave a party of his army, with fome of his e e-
phants, to oppofe Craterus, who was now aiou to
pafs the river all'o •, and, with the relt, to march againft
Alexander and his forces, wdio were already palled.
This reiolution once taken, he marched immediately
out of his camp at the head of 4000 horfe, 30,000
foot, 300 chariots, and 200 elephants. He advanced
as expeditioully as he could, till he came into a plain
which was iirm and fandy, where his chariots and ele¬
phants might act to advantage : there he halted, that
he might put his army in order, knowing w'ell that he
need not go in quell of his enemy. Alexander fcon
came up with his horfe, but he did not charge Porusj
on the contrary, he halted, and put his troops in or¬
der, that they might be able to defend themfelves in
cafe they were attacked. When he had waited fome
time, his foot arrived ; whom he immediately furround-
ed with his horfe, that, after fo fatiguing a march, they
might have time to cool and breathe themfelves, before
they wTere led to engage. Porus permitted all this, be-
caufe it w’as not his intereil to fight, and becaufe he
depended chiefly upon his order of battle, the elephants
covering his foot, fo that the Macedonians could not
charge them.
Porufhim- When Alexander had difpofed his foot in proper
fell defeat- order, he placed his horfe on the w-ings : and, oblerv-
ed. ing that he was much fuperior in them to the enemy,
and that the cavalry of Porus w^ere eafy to be charged,
he refolved to let the foot have as little (hare as pollible
in the battle. To this end, having giving the neceffa-
ry directions to Coenus who commanded them, he w’ent
himfelf to the right, and with great fury fell upon the
left wing of Porus. The difpute, though Ihort, was
very bloody: the cavalry of Porus, though they fought
gallantly, wrere quickly broken j and the foot being by
this means uncovered, the Macedonians charged them.
But the Indian horfe rallying, came up to their relief,
yet were again defeated. By this time the archers had
wmunded many of the elephants, and killed mofi. of
their riders, fa that they did not prove lefs troublefome
and dangerous to their own fide than to the Macedo¬
nians j whence a great confufion enfued: and Coenus,
taking this opportunity, fell on with the troops under
his command, and entirely defeated the Indian army.
Porus himfelf behaved with the greateft intrepidity,
and with the moft excellent conduCl : he gave his or¬
ders and direCled every thing, as long as his troops
retained their form ; and when they were broken, he
retired from party to party as they made Hands, and
continued fighting till every corps of Indians was put
to the rout. In the mean time Craterus had palled
with the rell of the Macedonian army 5 and thefe, fal¬
ling upon the flying Indians, increafed the daughter
of the day exceffively, infomuch that 20,000 foot and
3000 horfe were killed, all the chariots were hacked to
pieces, and the elephants not killed wrere taken ; two
of Porus’s fons fell here, as alfo moil of his officers of
all ranks.
As for Porus, Alexander gave ilriCl directions that
no injury might be done to his perfon : he even fent
Taxiles to perfuade him to furrender himfelf, and to
affure him that he ihould be treated with all the kind-
nefs and refpeft imaginable ; but Porus, difdaining this
advice from the mouth of an old enemy, threw a jave¬
lin at him, and had killed him but for the quick turn

of his hcr’e, Meroe the Indian, who was alfo in the Mace Jon.
fervice of Alexander, fucceeded better : he had been '
the old acquaintance of Porus 5 and therefore when he
entreated that prince to fpare his perfon, and to fubmit
himfelf to fortune and a generous viclor, Poms &!-He fubmits
lowed his advice ; and we may truly fay, that the con-to Alexan-
dition of this Indian king fuffered nothing by the lofs Jer.
of the battle. Alexander immediately gave him his li¬
berty, reftored him fliortly after to his kingdom, to
which he annexed provinces almoft equal to it in va¬
lue. Neither w'as Alexander a lofer by his munifi¬
cence •, for Porus remained his true friend and con-
ilant ally.
To perpetuate the memory of this viclory, Alex¬
ander ordered two cities to be eredled j one on the
field of battle, which he named Niccea; the other on
this fide the river, which he called Bucepha/a, in ho¬
nour of his horfe Bucephalus, who died here, as Ar¬
rian fays, of mere old age, being on the verge of
30. All the foldiers who fell in the battle, he uuried
with great honours; offered folemn facrifices to the
gods, and exhibited pompous ftiows on the banks of
the Hydafpes, where he had forced his paffage. He
than entered the territories of the Glaufse, in which
were 37 good cities, and a multitude of populous
villages. All thefe were delivered up to him without
fighting ; and as foon as he received them, he pre-
fented them to Porus; and having reconciled him to
Taxiles, he fent the latter home to his own dominions.
About this time ambaffaflors arrived from fome Indian
princes with their fubmiflions : and Alexander havinp-
conquered the dominions of another Porus, which lay
on the Hydraotes, a branch of the Indus, added them
to thofe of Porus his ally.
In the middle of all this fuccefs, however, news
arrived, that the Cathei, the Oxydracae, and the Malli,
the moil warlike nations of India, were confederated
againft the Macedonians, and had drawn together a
great army. The king immediately marched to give
them battle; and in a few days reached a city called
Sanga/a, feated on the top of a hill, and having a py
fine lake behind it. Before this city the confederate Sangala
Indians lay encamped, having three circular lines oftaken‘
carriages locked together, and their tents pitched in
the centre. Notwithflanding the apparent difficulty
of forcing thefe intrenchments, Alexander refolved im¬
mediately to attack them. The Indians make a noble
defence ; but at lafl: the firft line of their carriages was
broken, and the Macedonians entered. The fecond
was ftronger by far ; yet Alexander attacked that
too, and after a defperate refiltance forced it. The
Indians, without trufting to the third, retired into the
city ; which Alexander would have invefted : but the
foot he had with him not being fufficient for that
purpofe, he caufed his works to be carried on both
lides as far as the lake; and, on the other fide of that,
ordered feveral brigades of horfe to take poll 3 order¬
ing alfo battering engines to be brought up, and in
fome places employing miners. The lecond night, he
received intelligence that the befieged, knowing the
lake to be fordable, intended to make their efcape
through it. Upon this the king ordered all the car¬
riages which had been taken in forcing their camp to
be placed up and down the roads, in hopes of hinder¬
ing their flight} giving direftions to Ptolemy, who
commanded
MAC [ 3*5 1 MAC
Macedon. commanded the horfe on the other fide of the lake, to
’ ^ 1 be extremely vigilant, and to caufe all his trumpets to
found, that the forces might repair to that port where
the Indians made their greateft effort. Thefe pre¬
cautions had all the effedt that could be defired : for
of the few Indians who got through the lake, and
pafifed the Macedonian horfe, the greater part were
killed on the roads; but the greateft part of their
army was conftraintd to retire again through the
water into the city. Two days after, the place was
taken by ftorm. Seventeen thoufand Indians were
killed ; 70,000 taken prifoners; With 300 chariots,
and 500 horfe. The Macedonians are faid to have
loft only 100 men in this fiege j but they had 1 200
wounded, and among thefe feveral perfons of great
diftindlion.
The city was no fooner taken, than Alexander de-
fpatched Eumenes his fecretary, with a party of horfe,
to acquaint the inhabitants of the cities adjacent with
what had befallen the Sangalans; promifing alfo, that
they fhould be kindly treated if they would fubmit.
But they were fo much affrighted at what had hap¬
pened to their neighbours, that, abandoning all their
cities, they fled into the mountains j choofing rather
to expofe themfelves to wild beafts, than to thefe in¬
vaders, who had treated their countrymen fo cruelly.
When the king was informed of this, he fent detach¬
ments of horfe and foot to fcour the roads ; and thefe,
finding aged, infirm, and wounded people, to the
number of about 500, put them to the fword without
Andmzed. mercy. Perceiving that it was impoffible to perfuade
^ the inhabitants to return, he caufed the city of San-
gala to be razed, and gave the territories to the few
Indians who had fubmitted to him.
Alexander, ftill unfated with conqueft, now pre¬
pared to pafs the Hyphafis. The chief reafon which
induced him to think of this expedition was, the in¬
formation he had received of the ftate of the countries
beyond that river. He w'as told that they were in
themfelves rich and fruitful j that their inhabitants
w’ere not only a very martial people, but very civilized;
that they, were governed by the nobility, who were
themfelves fubjeft to the laws; and that as they lived
in happinefs and freedom, it was likely they would
fight obftinately in defence of thofe bleflings. He
was farther told, that among thefe nations there were
the largeft, ftrongeft, and moft ufeful elephants bred
and tamed ; and was therefore fired with an earneft
defire to reduce fuch a bold and brave people under
his rule, and of attaining to the pofleflion of the many
valuable things that were faid to be amongft them.
As exorbitant, however, as his perfonal ambition was,
he found it impoflible to infufe any part of it into the
minds of his foldiers; who were fo far from wifhing
to triumph over new and remote countries, that they
pp were highly defirous of leaving thofe that they had
Alexander’s already conquered. When therefore they were in¬
troops re- formed of the king’s intentions, they privately con-
ceed ^te<^ together in the camp about the fituation of
ther. their own affairs. At this confultation, the graveft
and beft of the foldiers lamented that they were made
ufe of by their king, not as lions, w’ho fall fiercely

for leading them from battle to battle, from fiege to v '
fiege, and from river to river ; protefting that they
would follow him no further, nor lavifti away their
lives any longer, to purchafe fame for him.
Alexander was a man of too much penetration not
to be early in perceiving that his troops were very
uneafy. He therefore harangued them from his tri¬
bunal ; but though his eloquence was great, and the
love his army had for him w’as yet very ftrong, they
did not relent. For fome time the foldiers remained
fullen and filent; and at laft turned their eyes on Cce-
nus, an old and experienced general, whom Alexander
loved, and in whom the army put great confidence.—»
He had the generofity to undertake their caufe 5 and
told Alexander frankly, “ That men endured toil in
hopes of repofe j that the Macedonians were already
much reduced in their numoers $ that of thofe who
remained, the greater part were invalids; and that
they expeded, in confideration of their former fer-
vices, that he would now lead them back to their na¬
tive country: an ad which, of all others, would moil
contribute to his own great defigns $ fince it would
encourage the youth of Macedon, and even of all
Greece, to follow him in whatever new expedition he
pleafed to undertake.” The king was far from being
pleafed with this fpeech of Ccenus, and much lefs with
the difpofition of his army, which continued in a deep
filence. He therefore difmiffed the affembly : but
next day he called another, wherein he told the fol¬
diers plainly, that he would not be driven from his
purpofe j that he would proceed in his conquefts with
fuch as ihould follow him voluntarily ; as for the reft,
he would not detain them, but wrould leave them at
liberty to go home to Macedon, where they might
publifti, “ that they had left their king in the midft
of his enemies.” Even this expedient had no fuccefs ;
his army was fo thoroughly tired with long marches and
defperate battles, that they were determined to go no
further, either for fair fpeeches or foul. Upon this
Alexander retired to his tent, where he refufed to fee
his friends, and put on the fame gloomy temper that
reigned among his troops. For three days things
remained in this fituation. At laft the king fuddenly
appeared ; and, as if he had been fully determined to
purfue his firft defign, he gave orders for facrificing
for the good fuccefs of his new undertaking. Ari-
ftander the augur reported, that the omens were al¬
together inaufpicious j upon which the king faid, that
fince his proceeding farther was neither pleafing to
the gods, nor grateful to his army, he would return.
When this was rumoured among the army, they af- too
fembled in great numbers about the royal tent, falut- **e con"
ing the king with loud acclamations, wilhing him t^s t0 *e"
fuccefs in all his future defigns j giving him at the
fame time hearty thanks, for that “ he who was in¬
vincible had fuffered himfelf to be overcome by their
prayers.”
A ftop being thus put to the conquefts of Alexan¬
der, he determined to make the Hyphafis the boun¬
dary of his dominions ; and having ere6led twelve
altars of an extraordinary magnitude, he facrificed
on them : after which he exhibited (hows in the
Grecian manner j and, having added all the conquered
country in thefe parts to the dominions of Porus, he

oegan to return. Having arrived at the Hydafpes,
he made the neceiTary preparations for failing down
the Indus into the ocean. For this purpole, he or¬
dered vaft quantities of timber to be felled in the
neigiibourhood ox the Hydaipes, through which he
was to fail into the Indus; he caufed the veffels with
which he had pafied other rivers to be brought thi¬
ther, and ailembled a vaft number of artificers capable
of repairing and equipping his fleet; which, when
finifhed, confifted of bo veilels of three banks of oars,
and 2QCO leiler (flips and tranfports. Xhofe who were
to manage this ileet were collected out from the Phoe¬
nicians, Cyprians, Carians, and Egyptians following
nis army, and who were reckoned perfectly well fkilled
m the naval art. When all things were ready, the
army embarked about break of day; the king, in the
mean time, facrificing to the gods according to the
ceremonies ufed in his own country, and likewife ac¬
cording to thofe of the country where he now was.
i hen ne hunfelt went on board ; and caufing the fig*
nal to be given by found of trumpet, the fleet fet fail.
Craterus and Hephaeflion had marched fome days be¬
fore witn anotner divifion of the army ; and in three
days the fleet reached that part of the river which was
oppofite to their camps. Here he had information,
that tire Oxydracse paid Mhlli were railing forces to
oppoie him ; upon which he immediately determined
to reduce them ; for, during this voyage, he made it
a rule to compel the inhabitants on both fides of the
river to yield him obedience. But before he arrived
on the coafls of the people above mentioned, he him-
ielf fuftained no fmall danger; for, coming to the
confluence of the Aceflnes with the Hydafpes, from
whence both rivers roll together into the Indus, the
eddies, whirlpools, and rapid currents, rufhing with
tremendous noife from the refpe&ive channels of thofe
rivers into the great one formed by them both, at
once terrified thofe ivho navigated his veiTels, and ac¬
tually deftroyed many of the long veffels, with all who
were aboard of them ; the king himfelf being in fome
danger, and Nearchus the admiral not a little at a lofs.
As loon as this danger was over, Alexander went on
fliore ; and having ordered his elephants with fome
troops of horfe and archers to be carried acrofs, and
put under the command of Craterus, he then divided
his army on the left hand bank into three bodies ; the
firfl commanded by himfelf, the fecond by Hephae-
ilion, and the third by Ptolemy. Hephaeftion had
orders to move filently through the heart of the coun¬
try, five days march before the king ; that if, on
Alexander’s approach, any of the barbarians fhould
attempt to Ihelter themfelves by retiring into the
country, they might fall into the hands of Hephxe-
fiion. Ptolemy Lagus wTas ordered to march three
days journey behind the king, that if any efcaped his
army, they might fall into Ptolemy’s hands ; and the
iieet had orders to flop at the confluence of this river
with the Hydraotes till fuch time as thefe feveral corps
Ihould arrive.

therefore were flain in the field ; the reft He'd into the
city, and (hut. the gates. But this only protraded
their fate for a fliort time; for the king, baviao- cr_
dered the city to be invefted by his cavalry, took it
as well as the caftle, by ftorm, and put all he found’
tnere to. the fword. He fent at the fame time Per-
diccas with a confiderable detachment, to inveft an¬
other city of the Malli at a confiderable diftance ; but
when he came there, he found it abandoned. How¬
ever, he purfued the inhabitants who had but lately
left it, and killed great numbers of them on the road.
After this the king took leveral other cities, but not
without confiderable refiftance ; for the Indians fome-
times chofe to burn themfelves in their houfes rather
than furrender.. At laft he marched to their capital
city ;. and finding that abandoned, he proceeded to
th* river Hydraotes, where he found 50,000 men
encamped on the oppolite bank, in order to difpute
his paffage. He did not hefitate, however, to enter
the river with a confiderable party of horfe: and fi>
much were the Indians terrified at his prefence, that
their whole army retired before him. In a fhort time
they returned and attacked him, being afhamed to fly
before fuch an inconfiderable number; but in the
mean time the reft of the Macedonian forces came up,
and the Indians were obliged to retire to a city which
lay behind them, and which Alexander invefted that
very night. The next day he ftormed the city with
fuch violence, that the inhabitants were compelled
to abandon it, and to retire to the caftle, where
they prepared for an obftinate defence. The king
mftantly gave orders for fcaling the walls, and the
foldiers prepared to execute thefe orders as faff as.
they could; but the king being impatient caught hold
of a ladder and mounted it firft himfelf, being followed.
Dy Leonatus, Peuceftas, and Abreas, the latter a man
of great valour, and who on that account had double
pay allowed him. i he king having gained the top
of the battlements, cleared them quickly of the defend- 103
ants, killing fome of them with his fword, and pufh- His deifie-
ing others over the walls: but after this was done, herate valouiy
was in.more danger than ever; for the Indians galledand
him with their arrows from the adjacent towers,
though they durft not come near enough to engage
him. His own battalion of targeteers mounting in
hafte to fecond him, broke the ladders ; which, as
foon as Alexander perceived, he threw himfelf down
into the caftle, as did alfo Peuceftas, Leonatus, and
Abreas. As foon as the king was on the ground, the
Indian general ruftied forward to attack him; but
Alexander inftantly defpatched him, as well as feveral
others who followed him. Upon this the reft retired
and contented themfelves with throwing darts and
ftones at him at a diftance. Abreas was ftruck into
the head with an arrow, and died on the fpot; and
fliortiy after, another pierced through the king’s breaft-
plate into his body. As long as he had fpirits, he
defended himfelf valiantly; but, through a vaft effufion
of blood, lofing his fenfes, he fell upon his fliield.
Peuceftas then covered him with the facred fhield of
Pallas on one fide, as did Leonatus with his own
fhield on the other, though they themfelves were

' — foldiers on the outfide, eager to fave their king, fup-
104 plied their want of ladders, by driving large iron pins
*s,^Lh into the walls. By the help of thele many of them
fayed by afcended, and came to the afliftance of Alexander and
his men. his companions. The Indians were now llaughtered
without mercy \ but Alexander continued for fome
time in a very dangerous way : however, he at laid re¬
covered his ftrength, and (howed himfelf again to his
army, which filled them with the greateft joy.
The Malli, being now convinced that nothing but
fubmidion could fave the remainder of them, fent de¬
puties to Alexander, offering the dominion of their
country ; as did alfo the Oxydracae: and the king
having fettled every thing in thefe countries agreeable
,;jp to his mind, proceeded on his voyage down the river
ceetU in his Indus. In this voyage he received the fubmiffion of
voyage fome other Indian princes ^ and perceiving, that at
down the p0int the illand Pattala, the river divided itfelf
into two vaft branches, he ordered an haven and con¬
venient docks to be made there for his (hips ; and
when he had careened his fleet, he failed down the
right hand branch towards the ocean. In his paffage
he fuflained great difficulties by reafon of his want of
pilots, and at the mouth of the river very narrowly
miffed being call away : yet all this did not hinder
him from purfuing his firft defign, though it does not
appear that he had any other motive thereto than the
vain defire of boafting that he had entered the ocean
beyond the Indus : for, having confecrated certain
bulls to Neptune, and thrown them into the lea,
perfoimed certain libations of golden cups, and
thrown the cups alfo into the fea, he came back
again •, having only furveyed two little iflands, one
at the mouth of the Indus, and one a little farther in
the ocean.
On the king’s return to Pattala, he refolved to fail
down the ether branch of the Indus, that he might
fee whether it was more fafe and commodious for his
fleet than that which he had already tried ; and for
this he had very good reafons. He had refolved to
fend Nearchus with his fleet by fea, through the
Perfian gulf up the river Tigris, to meet him and
his army in Mefopotamia } but as the poflibility of
this voyage depended on the ceafing of the Etefian
winds, there was a neceflity of laying up the fleet till
the feafon (hould prove favourable. Alexander, there¬
fore, failing through this branch of the Indus, fought
on the fea coafl: for bays and creeks, where his fleet
might anchor in fafety •, he caufed alfo pits to be
funk, which might be filled with frefh water for the
ufe of his people ) and took all imaginable precautions
for preferving them in eafe and fafety till the feafon
would allow them to continue their voyage. In this
he fucceeded to his wi(h ; for he found this branch of
the river Indus, at its mouth, fpread over the plain
country, and forming a kind of lake, wherein a fleet
might ride with fafety. He therefore appointed Leo-
natus, and a part of his army, to carry on fuch works
as were neceffary : caufing them to be relieved by
Iz6 frefli troops as often as there was occafion : then hav-

Before the king’s departure, many of his friends

take. They told him, that nothing could be more rafti 'r~~“
or dangerous than this refolution. They acquainted
him, that the country through which he -was to travel
was a wild uncultivated ctefert j that Semiramis, when
fire led her foldiers this way out of India, brought
home but 20 of them 5 and that Cyrus, attempting
to do the fame, returned with only feven. But all this
was fo far from deterring Alexander, that it more
than ever determined him to purfue no other road. As
foon, therefore, as he had put things in order, he
marched at the head of a fufficient body of troops to
reduce the Oritse, who had never vouchiafed either to
make their fubmiflion or to court his friendfhip. Their
territories lay on the other fide of a river called /Ira¬
kis, which Alexander croffed fo fpeedily, that they
had no intelligence of his march ; whereupon mod of
them quitted their country, and fled into the deferts.
Their capital he found fo well (ituated, that he refolv¬
ed to take it out of their hands, and to caufe a new
and noble city to be founded there, the care of which
he committed to Hephaeftion. Then he received the
deputies of the Oritae and Gedrofi y and having affured
them, that if the people returned to their villages, they
{hould be kindly treated, and having appointed Apol-
lophenes prefident of the Oritae, and left a confiderable
body of troops under Leonatus to fecure their obe¬
dience, he began his march through Gedfofia. In this IO ,
march his troops fuffered incredible hardihips. The His dan-
road was very uncertain and troublefome, on account gerous
of its lying through deep and loofe fands, rifing in many n'iarch
places into hillocks, which forced the foldiers to climb,
at the fame time that it; funk under their feet ; there
were no towns, villages, nor places of refrefhment, to
be met with; fo that, after exceflive marches, they were
forced to encamp among thefe dry fands. As to pro-
vifions, they hardly met with any during their whole
march. The foluiers were therefore obliged to kill their
beads of carriage ; and fuch as were fent to bring fome
corn from the fea fide, were fo grievoufly diftreffed,
that, though it was fealed with the king’s lignet, they
cut open the bags, choofing rather to die a violent death
for difobedience than periih by hunger. When the
king, however, was informed of this, he freely par¬
doned the offenders ; he was alfo forced to accept
the excufes that were daily made for the lofs of
mules, horfes, &c. which were in truth eaten by the
foldiers, and their carriages broken in pieces to avoid
further trouble. As for wTater, their want of it was
a great misfortune ; and yet their finding it in plenty
was fometimes a greater: for, as by the firft they
periftied with third, fo by the latter they were burft,
thrown into dropiies, and rendered incapable of travel.
Frequently they met with no water for the whole day
together : fometimes they were difappointed of it at
night ; in which cafe, if they were able, they march¬
ed on ; fo that it was common with them to travel 30,
40, 50, or even 60 miles without encamping. Num¬
bers through thefe hardihips wTere obliged to lag in the
rear ; and of thele many were left behind, and perilh-
ed ; for indeed fcarce any ever joined the army again.
Their miferies, however, they fuftained with incre¬
dible patience, being encouraged by the example of
their king ; who, on this occaflon, fuftered greater
hardftiips than the meaneft foldier in.his army. At laft

Macedon. they arrived at the capital of Gedrofia, where they re-
- freihed themfelves, and ft aid fome time : after which
they marched into Caramania; which being a very plen¬
tiful country, they there made themfelves ample amends
for the hardfhips and fatigues they had fuftained. Here
they were joined firft by Craterus with the troops un¬
der his command, with a number of elephants: then
came Stafanor prefident of the Arians, and Pharif-
manes the fon of Phrataphernes governor of Parthia.
They brought with them camels, horfes, and other
bealts of burden, in vaft numbers ; having forefeen,
that the king’s march through Gedrofia would be attend¬
ed with the lofs of the greatefl part, if not of all the
cavalry and beads belonging to his army.
During Alexander’s flay in Caramania, he redreffed
the injuries of his people, who had been grievoufly op-
preffed by their governors during his abfence. Here
alfo he was joined by his admiral Nearchus, who
brought him an account that all under his command
were in perfect fafety, and in excellent condition ;
with which the king was mightily pleafed, and, after
having beftowed on him Angular marks of his favour,
fent him back to the navy. Alexander next let out for
Perfia, where great diforders had been committed during
his abfence. Thefe alfo he redreffed, and caufed the
governor to be crucified j appointing in his room Peu-
ceflas, who faved his life when he fought fingly againil
a whole garrifon as above related. The new governor
was no fooner invefted with his dignity, than he laid
afide the Macedonian garb, and put on that of the
Medes ; being the only one of Alexander’s captains,
who, by complying with the manners of the people he
governed, gained their affe&ion.
While Alexander vifited the different parts of Per¬
fia, he took a view, among the reft, of the ruins of Per-
fepolis, where he is faid to have expreffed great for-
row for the deftruftion he had formerly occafioned.
From Perfepolis he marched to Sufa, where he gave
an extraordinary loofe to pleafure j refolving to make
hunfelf and his followers fome amends for the difficul¬
ties they had hitherto undergone : purpofing at the
fame time fo effectually to unite his newr conquered
with his hereditary fubjefts, that the jealoufies and
fears which had hitherto tormented both, ftiould no
longer fubfift. With this view he married two wives
of the blood royal of Perfia ; viz. Barfine, or Statira,
the daughter of Darius, and Paryfaiis the daughter
of Ochus. Drypetis, another daughter of Darius, he
gave to Hephaeftion ; Amaftrine, the daughter of Oxy-
artes the brother of Darius, married Craterus j and
to the reft of his friends, to the number of 80, he gave
other wojnen of the greateft quality. All thefe mar¬
riages were celebrated at once, Alexander bimfelf be¬
llowing fortunes upon them ; he directed likewife to
take account of the number of his officers and foldiers
who had married Afiatic wives; and though they ap¬
peared to be 10,coo, yet he gratified each of them ac¬
cording to his rank. He next refolved to pay the debts
of his army, and thereupon iffued an edicft directing
debts ot his every man to regifter his name and the firm he owed 5
army. with which the foldiers complying flowly, from an ap-
prehcnfion that there was fome defign againft them,
Alexander ordered tables heaped with money to be fet
in all quarters of the camp, and caufed every man’s
debts to be paid on his bare word, without even

came to 20,000 talents. On fuch as had diftinguifhed
themfelves in an extraordinary manner, he beftowed
crowns of gold. Peuceftas had the firft j Leonatus
the fecond •, Nearchus the third; Oneficritus the
fourth ; Hephaeftion the fifth ; and the reft of his
guards had each of them one. After this he made
other difpofitions for conciliating, as he fuppofed, the
differences among all his fubjefts. He reviewed the
30,000 youths, whom at his departure for India he had
ordered to be taught Greek and the Macedonian dif-
cipline j expreffing high fatisfadion at the fine appear¬
ance they made, which rendered them worthy of the
appellation he beftowed on them, viz. that of Epigotii,
e. fucceffors. He promoted alfo, without any di-
fhndion of nation, all thofe who had ferved him faith¬
fully and valiantly in the Indian war. When all theie
regulations wrere made, he gave the command of his
heavy armed troops to Hephaeftion, and ordered him
to march diredly to the banks of the Tigris, while in
the mean time a fleet was equipped for carrying the
king and the troops he retained with him down to the
ocean.

1 hus ended the exploits of Alexander j the greateft
conqueror that ever the world law, at leaft with re-
fped to the rapidity of his conquefts. In 12 years'
time he had brought under his fubjeftion Egypt,
Libya, Alia Minor, Syria, Phoenicia, Paleftine, Ba¬
bylonia, Perfia, with part of India and Tartary. Still,
however, he meditated greater things. He had now
got a great tafte in maritime affairs j and is faid to
have meditated a voyage to the coafts of Arabia and
Ethiopia, and thence round the whole continent of
Africa to the ftraits of Gibraltar. But of this there
is no great certainty ; though that he intended to fub-
due the Carthaginians and Italians, is more than pro¬
bable. AH thefe defigns, however, were fruftrated by
his death, which happened at Babylon in 323 B. C.
He is faid to have received feveral warnings of his ap¬
proaching fate, and to have been advifed to avoid that
city; which advice he either defpifed or could not
follow. He died of a fever after eight days illnefs, a(.
without naming any fucceffor ; having only given his Babylon^
ring to Perdiccas, and left the kingdom, as he faid,
to the moj} worth/.
The chara&er of this great prince has been varioufly H;s charac-
reprefented ; but moft hiftorians feem to have looked ter.
upon him rather as an illuftrious madman than one
upon whom the epithet of Great could be properly be¬
ftowed. From a careful obfervation of his condutft,
however, it muft appear, that he poffeffed not only a
capacity to plan, but likewife to execute, the greateft
enterprifes that ever entered into the mind of any of
the human race. From whatever caufe the notion
originated, it is plain that he imagined himfelf a divine
perfon, and born to fubdue the whole world : and ex¬
travagant and impracticable as this fcheme may appear
at prefent, it cannot at all be looked upon in the fame
light in the time of Alexander. The Greeks were in
his time the moft powerful people in the world in re-
fpeft to their Ikill in the military art, and the Perfians
were the moft powerful with refpeCt to wealth and
numbers. I he only other powerful people in the
world were the Carthaginians, Gauls, and Italian na¬
tions. From a long feries of wars which the Cartha¬
ginians
/
Macedon
M AC C 31
ginians carried on in Sicily, it appeared tnat they
'were by no means capable of contending with the
Greeks even when they had an immenfe fuperiority ot
numbers ; much lefs then could they have futtained
an attack from the whole power of Greece and Afia
united. The Gauls and Italians were indeed very
brave, and of a martial difpofition ; but they were bar-
barous, and could not have refifted armies well
ciplined and under the command of fuch^ a fkiiiul
leader as Alexander. Even long after this time, it ap¬
peared that the Romans themfelves could not have
refilled the Greeks ; fince Regulus, after having de¬
feated the Carthaginians and reduced them to^tne ut-
moft didrefs, was totally unable to refill a Carthagi¬
nian army commanded by a Greek general, and guided
by Greek difcipline.
Thus it appears, that the fcheme of Alexander can¬
not by any means be accounted that of a madman, or
of one who projetts great things without judgement or
means to execute them. If we confider fiom his. ac¬
tions the end which molt probably he had in view,
could his fcheme have been accomplifhed, we lhall find
it not only the greateft but the bejl that can poffibly
be imagined. He did not concjuer to dellroy, enllave,
or opprefs; but to civilize and unite the whole world
as one nation. No fooner was a province concjucred
than he took care of it as if it had been part_ of his
paternal inheritance. He allowed not his loldiers to
opprefs and plunder the Perlians, which they j'616
very much inclined to do } on the contrary, by.giving
into the oriental cuiloms himfelf, he drove to extinguifh
that inveterate hatred which had fo long fubfiiied be¬
tween the two nations. In the Scythian countries
which he fubdued, he purfued the fame excellent plan.
His courage and military {kill, m which he never was
excelled, were difplayed, not with a view to rapine or
defultory concjueil, but to civilize and inuuce the bar*
barous inhabitants to employ themfelves in a moie pro¬
per way of life. “ Midll the hardlhips of a military
life (fays Dr Gillies), obftinate fieges, bloody battles,
and dear bought vi&ories, he dill refpeaed the rights
of mankind/and praclifed the mild virtues of huma¬
nity. The conquered nations enjoyed their ancient
laws and privileges ■, the rigours of defpotifm were foft-
ened •, arts and indudry encouraged j and the proudeil
Macedonian governors compelled, by the authority and
example of Alexander, to obferve the rules of judice
towards their meaneft fubjefts. do bridle the fierce
inhabitants of the Scythian plains, he founded cities
and edablxlhed cplonies on tne banks of the laxartes
and Oxus ; and tbofe dedructive campaigns usually
alcribed to his redlefs aclivity, and blind ambition,
appeared to the difcernment of this extraordinary man
not only eflential to the fecurity of the conqueds
which he had already made, but neceflary for the more
remote and fplendid expeditions which he dill pur-
pofed to undertake, and which he performed with
lingular boldnefs and unexampled fuccefs.” In an¬
other place, the fame author gives his character in the
following words.
“ He was of a low ftature, and fomewhat deform¬
ed ; but the aftivity and elevation of his mind, ani¬
mated and ennobled his frame. By a life of. continual
labour, and by an early and habitual pra£lice of the
gymnaftic exercifes, he had hardened his body againft

the imprefiior.s of cold and heat, hunger and third, MaceJur«
and prepared his robuft conftitution for bearing fuch
exertions of ftrength and aflivity, as have appeared
incredible to the undifciplined foftnefs of modern times.
In generofity and in prowefs,_ he rivalled the greatell
heroes of antiquity j and in the race of glory, having
finally outftripped all competitors, became ambitious
to furpafs himfelf. His fuperior fkill in war gave un¬
interrupted fuccefs to his arms •, and his natural hu¬
manity, enlightened by the philofophy of Greece,
taught him to improve his conquefis to the bed inte-
refts of mankind. In his extenfive dominions he built
or founded not lefs than 70 cities; the fituation of
which being chofen with confummate wifdom, tended
to facilitate communication, to promote commerce,
and to diffufe civility through the greateft nations of
the earth. It may be fufpe£led, indeed, that he mif-
took the extent of human power, when in the courfe
of one reign he undertook to change the face of the
world ; and that he mifcalculated the ftubbornnefs of
ignorance and the force of habit, when he attempted
to enlighten barbarifm, to foften fervitude, and to
tranfplant the improvements of Greece into an Afri¬
can and Afiatic foil, where they have never been
known to flourifti. Yet let not the defigns of Alex¬
ander be too haftily accufed of extravagance. Who¬
ever ferioufly confiders what he actually performed be¬
fore his 33d year, will be cautious of determining what
he might have accompiifhed had he reached the ordi¬
nary term of human life. His refources were peculiar
to himfelf; and fuch views as well as a&ions became
him as would have become none befides. In the lan¬
guage of a philofophical hiftorian, ‘ he feems to have
been given to the world by a peculiar difpenfation of
Providence, being a man like to none other of the
human kind.’
“ From the part which his father Philip and himfelf
afted in the affairs of Greece, his hiftory has been
tranfmitted through the impure channels of exagge¬
rated flattery or malignant envy. The innumerable
fidlions ivhich difgrace the works of his biographers,
are contradidled by the moft authentic accounts of his
reign, and inconfiftent with thofe public tranfadlions
which concurring authorities confirm. In the prefent
work it feemed unneceffary to expatiate on fuch topics,
fince it is lefs the bufinefs of hiftory to repeat or even
to expofe errors than to feleft and imprefs ufeful truths.
An author, ambitious of attaining that purpofe, can
feldom indulge the language of general panegyric.
He will acknowledge, that Alexander’s adlions were
not always blamelefs ; but, after the moft careful ex¬
amination, he will affirm, that his faults were few in
number, and refulted from his fituation rather than
from his charafler.
“ From the firft years of his reign he experienced the
crimes of difaffe£lion and treachery, which multiplied
and became more dangerous with the extent of his
dominions and the difficulty to govern them. Several
of his lieutenants early afpired at independence ; others
formed confpiracies againft the life of their mafter.
The firft criminals were treated with a lenity becom¬
ing the generous fpirit of Alexander : but when
Philotas, the fon of Parmenio, and even Parmenio
himfelf, afforded reafon to fufpeeft their fidelity *, when
the Macedonian youths, who, according to the infti-
- tution
MAC [ 320 ]
edon. tution of Philip, guarded the roj'al pavilion, prepared
to murder their fovereign, he found it neceTary to de¬
part from his lenient fyftem, and to hold with a firmer
hand the reins of government. Elated by unexampled
profperity, and the fubmiffive reverence of vanquished
nations, his loftinefs difgufted the pride of his Euro¬
pean troops, particularly the Macedonian nobles, who
had been accuftomed to regard tbemfelves rathA- as his
companions than fubje&s. The pretenfions which
found policy taught him to form and to maintain, of
being treated with thofe external honours ever claim¬
ed by the monarchs of the Eaft, highly offended the
religious prejudices of the Greeks, who deemed it im¬
pious to proftrate the body or bend the knee to any
mortal fovereign. Yet had he remitted formalities
confecrated by the pra&ice of ages, he muff infenfibly
have loft the refpeft of his Afiatic fubje&s. With a
view to reconcile the difcordant principles of the vic¬
tors and vanquifhed, he affedled an immediate defcent
from Jupiter .Ammon, a claim liberally admitted by the
avarice or fears of the Libyan priefts ; and which, he
had reafon to expedf, could not be very obftinately
denied by the credulity of the Greeks and Macedo¬
nians j wrho univerfally acknowledged that Philip, his
reputed father, rvas remotely defcended from the Gre¬
cian Jupiter. But the fuccefs of this defign, which
might have entitled him, as fon of Jupiter, to the fame
obeifance from the Greeks which the barbarians rea¬
dily paid him as monarch of the Eaft, wTas counter-
adled, at firft by the fecret difpleafure, and afterwards
by^the open indignation, of feveral of his generals and
courtiers. Nor did the conduift of Alexander tend to
extricate him from this difficulty. With his friends
he maintained that equal intercourfe of vifits and en¬
tertainments which charadlerized the Macedonian man¬
ners j indulged the liberal flow of unguarded conver-
fation j and often exceeded that intemperance in wine
wduch difgraced his age and country.”
We fliall conclude this chara£ler of Alexander with
obferving, that he had in viewq and undoubtedly muft
have accomplifhed, the fovereignty of the ocean as well
as of the land. The violent refiftance made by the
Tyrians had ftiown him the ftrength of a commercial
nation ; and it was undoubtedly with a view to enrich
his dominions by commerce, that he equipped the fleet
on the Indus, and wdftied to keep up a communication
with India by fea as well as by land. “ It was chiefly
wdth a view to the former of thefe obje«5ls (fays Dr Ro-
bertfon), that he examined the navigation of the Indus
with fo much attention. With the fame view, on his
return to Sufa, he in perfon furveyed the courfe of the
Euphrates and Tigris, and gave diredtions to remove
the cataradls or dams with which the ancient monarchs
of Perfia, induced by a peculiar precept of their reli¬
gion, which enjoined them to guard with the utmoft
care againft defiling any of the elements, had conftrudt-
ed near the mouths of thefe rivers, in order to (hut out
their fubjedls from any accefs to the ocean. By open¬
ing the navigation in this manner, he propofed, that the
valuable commodities of India (hould be conveyed from
the Perfian gulf into the interior parts of his Afiatic do¬
minions, while by the Arabian gulf they ftiould be car¬
ried to Alexandria, and diftributed to the reft of the
world.
“ Grand and extenfive as thefe fchemes were, the

carrying them into execution, were fo various and lb
proper, that Alexander had good reafon to entertain
fanguine hopes of their proving fuccefsful. At the time
when the mutinous, fpirit of his foldiers obliged him to
relinquiffi his operations in India, he was not 30 years
of age complete. At this dnterprifing period of life, a
prince of a fpirit fo ab'tive, peifevering, and indefati¬
gable, muft have foon found means to refume a favour¬
ite meafure on which he had been long intent. If he
had invaded India a fecond time, he would not, as for¬
merly, have been obliged to force his way through hof-
tile and unexplored regions, oppofed at every ftep by
uations and tribes of barbarians whofe names had never
reached Greece. All Alia, from the ftiores of the Io¬
nian fea to the banks of the Hyphafis, would then have
been fubjecl to his dominion ; and through that 'in-
menfe ftretch of country he had eflabiiflied fuch a chain
of cities .pr fortified ftations, that his armies might have
continued their march with fafety, and have found a
regular fucceffion of magazines provided for their fub-
fiftence. Nor would it have been difficult for him to
bring into the field forces fufficient to have achieved the
conqueft of a country fo populous and extenfive as In¬
dia. Having armed and difciplined his fubjeds in the
eaft like Europeans, they would have been ambitious
to imitate and to equal their inftrudors; and Alexan¬
der might have drawn recruits, not from his fcanty do¬
mains in Macedonia and Greece, but from the vaft re¬
gions of Afia, which in every age has covered the
earth, and aftoniffied mankind with its numerous ar¬
mies. When at the head of fuch a formidable power
he had reached the confines of India, he might have
entered it under circumftances very different from thofe
in his firft expedition. He had fecured a firm footing
there, partly by means of the garrifons which he left in.
the three cities which he had built and fortified, and
partly by his alliance with Taxiles and Porus. Thefe
two Indian princes, won by Alexander’s humanity and
beneficence, which, as they were virtues feldom dif-
played in the ancient mode of carrying on war, excited
of courfe a higher degree of admiration and gratitude,
had continued fteady in their attachment to the Mace¬
donians. Reinforced by their troops, and guided by
their information as well as by the experience which he
had acquired in his former campaigns, Alexander muft
have made rapid progrefs in a country where every in¬
vader from his time to the prefent age has proved fuc¬
cefsful.
“ But this and all his other fplendid fchemes were
terminated at once by his untimely death. In con-
fequence of that, however, events took place which il-
luftrate and confirm the juflnefs of the preceding fpecu-
lations and conjectures, by evidence the moft ftriking
and fatisfa&ory. When that great empire, which the
fuperior genius of Alexander had kept united and in
fubjeClion, no longer felt his fupcrintending controul,
it broke into pieces, and its various provinces were
feized by his principal officers, and parcelled out among
them. From ambition, emulation, and perfonal animo-
fity, they foon turned their arms againft one another j
and as feveral of the leaders were equally eminent for
political abilities and for military {kill, the conteft was
maintained long, and carried on with frequent viciffi-
tudes of fortune. Amidft the various convulfions and
revolutions

the meafures of Alexander for the prefervation of his
conquefts had been concerted with fuch fagacity, that
upon the final reftoration of tranquillity, the Macedo¬
nian dominion continued to be eftablilhed in every part
of Alia, and not one province had lhaken olf the yoke.
Even India, the moft remote of Alexander’s conquefts,
quietly fubmitted to Python the fon of Agenor, and af¬
terwards to Seleucus, who fucceflively obtained domi¬
nion over that part of Alia. Porus and Taxiles, not-
withftanding the death of their benefadtor, neither de¬
clined fubmiflion to the authority of the Macedonians,
nor made any attempt to recover independence.”
With the death of Alexander fell alfo the glory of
the Macedonians ; who very foon relapfed into a fitu-
ation as bad, or worfe, than that in which they had
Caufesof been before the reign of Philip. This was occafioned
the diflolu- principally by his not having diftindlly named a fuc-
ceffor, and having no child of his own come to the
years of difcretion to whom the kingdom might feem
naturally to belong. The ambition and jealoufy of his
mother Olympias, his queen Roxana, and efpecially of
the great commanders of his army, not only prevented
a fucceffor from being ever named, but occafioned the
death of every perfon, whether male or female, who
kwas in the leaft related to Alexander. To have a juft
notion of the origin of thefe difturbances, it is necef-
fary in the firft place to underftand the fituation of the
Macedonian affairs at the time of Alexander’s death.
When Alexander fet out for Alia, he left Antipater,
as we formerly obferved, in Macedon, to prevent any
difturbances that might arife either there or in Greece.
The Greeks, even during the lifetime of Alexander,
bore the fuperiority which he exercifed over them with
great impatience *, and, though nothing could be more
gentle than the government of Antipater, yet he was
exceedingly hated, becaufe he obliged them to be quiet.
One of the laft aftionsof Alexander’s life fet all Greece
in a flame. He had, by an edift, direfled all the cities
of Greece to recal their exiles ; which edidt, when it
was publilhed at the Olympic games, created much
confufion. Many of the cities were afraid, that, when
the exiles returned, they would change the govern¬
ment ; moft of them doubted their own fafety if the
edifl took place j and all of them held this peremptory
decree to be a total abolition of their liberty. No foon-
er therefore did the new7s of Alexander’s death arrive
than they prepared for war.
In Alia the ftate of things was not much better ; not
indeed through any inclination of the conquered coun¬
tries to revolt, but through the diffenfions among the
commanders.—In the general council which was called
foon after the death of Alexander, after much confufion
and altercation, it wTas at laft agreed, or rather com¬
manded by the foldiers, that Aridaeus the brother of
Alexander, who had always accompanied the king, and
had been wont to facrifice with him, thould affume the
fovereignty.——This Aridaeus was a man of very fiender
parts and judgement, not naturally, but by the wicked
praflices of Olympias, who had given him poifonous
draughts in his infancy, left he ftiould ftand in the way
of her fon Alexander or any of his family •, and for this,
or fome other reafon, Perdiccas, Ptolemy, and moft of
the horfe officers, refented his promotion to fuch a de¬
gree, that they quitted the affembly, and even the city. embalmed.

However, Meleager, at the head of the phalanx, vigo- Macedan.
roufly fupported their firft refolution, and threatened' v
loudly to ftied the blood of thofe who affedled to rule
over their equals, and to affume a kingdom which no¬
way belonged to them : Aridaeus was accordingly ar¬
rayed in royal robes, had the arms of Alexander put
upon him, and was faluted by the name of P/ii/i/>, to n<5
render him more popular. Thus were two parties form-A party
ed, at the head of whom were Meleager and Perdiccas;
both of them pretending vaft concern for the public ggr anjj
good, yet, at bottom, defiring nothing more than their another by
owm advantage. Perdiccas was a man of high birth, Perdiccas.
and had a fupreme command in the army, was much in
favour with Alexander, and one in whom the nobility
had put great confidence. Meleager had* become for¬
midable by having the phalanx on his fide, and having
the nominal king entirely in his power ; for Aridaeus,
or Philip, was obliged to comply writh whatever he
thought proper ; and publicly declared, that whatever
he did was by the advice of Meleager •, fo that he made
his minifter accountable for his own fchemes, and no¬
way endangered himfelf. The Macedonians alfo, be-
fides their regard for the deceafed king, foon began to
entertain a perfona! love for Philip on account of his
moderation.
It is remarkable, however, that notwithftanding all
the favours which Alexander had conferred upon his
officers, and the fidelity with wffiich they had ferved
him during his life, only two of them were attached to
the interefts of his family after his death. Thefe were
Antipater, and Eumenes the Cardian, whom he had
appointed his fecretary. Antipater, as we have al.
ready feen, was embroiled with the Greeks, and could
not affift the royal family "tvho were in Alia ; and Eu¬
menes had not as yet fufficient intereft to form a party ny
in their favour. In a ftiort time, however, Perdiccas Meleager
prevailed againft Meleager, and got him murdered jniur,Iered,
by which means the fupreme power for a time fell into aJrg ^ enN
his hands. His firft ftep, in confequence of this power, vided!"
was to diftribute the provinces of the empire among the
commanders in the following manner, in order to pre¬
vent competitors, and to iatisfy the ambition of the
principal commanders of the army. Aridaeus, and the
fon of Roxana, born after the death of his father, were
to enjoy the regal authority. Antipater had the go¬
vernment of the European provinces. Craterus had
the title of prote&or. Perdiccas was general of the
houfehold troops in the room of Hephaeftion. Ptolemy
the fon of Lagus had Egypt, Libya, and that part of
Arabia which borders upon Egypt. Cleomenes, a man
of infamous chara&er, whom Alexander had made re¬
ceiver-general in Egypt, was made Ptolemy’s deputy.-
Leomedon had Syria ; Philotas, Cilicia ; Python, Me¬
dia ; Eumenes, Cappadocia, Paphlagonia, and all the
country bordering on the Euxine fea, as far as Trape-
zus; but thefe were not yet conquered, fo that he was
a governor without a province. Antigonus had Pam-
phylia, Lycia, and Phrygia Major; Caffander, Ca- >
ria ; Menander, Lydia ; Leonatus, Phrvgia on
Hellefpont.

Six temples of extraordinary magnificence were to be
erefted at the expence of 1500 talents each. 4. Caf-
tles, arfenals, havens, and yards for building Ihips, to
be fettled in proper places throughout his empire. * 5.
Several new cities were to be built in Europe and Afia j
thofe in Afia to be inhabited by colonies from Europe,
and thofe in Europe to be filled with Afiatics ; that, by
blending their people and their manners, that hereditary
antipathy might be eradicated which had hitherto fub-
fifted between the inhabitants of the different conti¬
nents. . 6. Laftly, He had proje£ted the building of a
pyramid, equal in bulk and beauty to the biggeft in E-
gypt, in honour of his father Philip. All thefe de-
figns, under pretence of their being expenfive, were re¬
ferred to a council of Macedonians, to be held nobody
knew when or where.
The government, being now in the hands of Perdic-
cas and Roxana, grew quickly very cruel and diftafte-
fhl. Alexander was fcarce dead when the queen lent
for Statira and Drypetis the two daughters of Darius,
one of whom had been married to Alexander and the5
other to Hephaeftion : but as foon as they arrived at
Babylon, caufed them both to be murdered, that no
fon of Alexander by any other woman, or of Hephcef-
tion, might give any trouble to her or her fon Alexan¬
der. Sifygambis, the mother of Darius, no fooner
heard that Alexander the Great was dead, than (he laid
violent hands on herfelf, being apprehenfive of the ca¬
lamities which were about to enfue.
War was firft declared in Greece againft Antipater
in the year 321 B. C. Through the treachery of the
Theffalians, that general was defeated, with the army
he had under his own command. Leonatus was there¬
fore fent from Afia, with a very confiderable army, to
his afliftance •, but both were overthrown with great lofs
by the confederates, and Leonatus himfelf was killed.
In a fhort time, however, Craterus arrived in Greece
with a great army, the command of which he refigned
to Antipater. The army of the confederates amounted
to 25,000 foot and 3000 horfe ; but Antipater com¬
manded no fewer than 40,000 foot, 3000 archers, and
5000 horfe. In fuch an unequal conteft, therefore, the
Greeks were defeated, and forced to fue for peace ;
which they did not obtain but on condition of their re¬
ceiving Macedonian garrifons into feveral of their cities.
At Athens alfo the democratic government was abro¬
gated •, and fuch a dreadful punifhment did this feem to
the Athenians, that 22,000 of them left their country,
and retired into Macedon.
While thefe things w^ere ,doing in Greece, difturb-
ances began alfo to arife in Afia and in Thrace. The
Greek mercenaries, who were difperfed through the
inland provinces of Afia, defpairing of ever being al¬
lowed to return home by fair means, determined to
attempt it by force. For this purpofe, they affembled
to the number of 20,000 foot and 3000 horfe 5 but
were all cut oft’ to a man by the Macedonians. In
Thrace, Lyfimachus was attacked by one Seuthes, a

mander was forced to engage this army with no more
than 4000 foot and 2000 horfe, yet he kept the field
of battle, and could not be driven out of the country.
I erdiccas, m the mean time, by pretending friendfliip
to the royal family, had gained over Eumenes entirely
to his intereft; and at laft put him in poffeflion of the Ambition
province of Cappadocia by the defeat of Ariarathes and crue!-
King or that country, ivhom he afterwards cruelly tJof
cauied to be crucified. His ambition, however, now (^ccas‘
began to lead him into difficulties. At the firft divifion
or the provinces, Perdiccas, to ftrengthen his own au¬
thority, had propofed to marry Nicaea the daughter of
Anti pater j and fo well was this propofal reliftied, that
yer brethren Jolias and Archias conducted her to him,
in order to be prefent at the celebration of the nuptials.
But Perdiccas now had other things in view. He had
been foheited by Olympias to marry her daughter Cleo¬
patra, the widow of Alexander king of Epirus, and
w o then refided at Sardis in Lydia. Eumenes pro¬
moted this match to the utmoft of his power, becaufe
he thought it would be for the intereft of the royal fa¬
mily ; and his perfuafions had fuch an effeft on Perdic¬
cas, that he was fent to Sardis to compliment Cieopa-
tia, and to carry prefents to her in name of her new
lover. In the abfence of Eumenes, however, Alcetas,
the brother of Perdiccas, perfuaded him to marry Ni-
ca:a.’ but> in order to gratify his ambition, he refolved
to divorce her immediately after marriage, and marry
Cleopatra. By this laft marriage, he hoped to have a
pretence for altering the government of Macedon : and,
as a neceflary meafure preparative to thefe, he entered
into contrivances for deftroying Antigonus. Unfortu¬
nately for himfelf, however, he ruined all his fchemes
by his own jealoufy and precipitate cruelty. Cynane,
the daughter of Philip by his fecond wife, had brought
her daughter named Adda, and who was afterwards
named Eurydice, to court, in hopes that King Aridams
might marry her. Againft Cynane, Perdiccas, from
fome political motives, conceived fuch a grudge, that he
caufed her to be murdered. This raifed a commotion-
in the army ; which frightened Perdiccas to fuch a de¬
gree, that he now promoted the match between Ari-
dams and Eurydice j to prevent which, he had murder¬
ed the mother of the young princefs. But, in the mean
time, Antigonus, knowing the1 defigns of Perdiccas
againft himfeif, fted with his ion Demetrius to Greece,
there to take ftielter under the prote6Hon of Antipater
and Craterus, whom he informed of the ambition and
cruelty of the regent.
A civil war was now kindled. Antipater, Craterus, a combi-
Neoptolemus, and Antigonus, were combined againft nation
Perdiccas j and it was the misfortune of the

general, that Eumenes, the moft able general, as well
as the moft: virtuous of all the commanders, was on
the fide of Perdiccas, becaufe he believed him to be
in the intereft of Alexander’s family. Ptolemy, in the
mean time, remained in quiet poffeffion of Egypt ; but
rvithout the leaft intention of owning any perfbn for his

It was now thought proper to bury the body.
Alexander, which had been kept for two years, during

Aridgeus, to whofe care it was committed, fet out from
Babylon for Damafcus, in order to carry the king’s bo¬
dy to Egypt. This was fore againft the will of Per¬
diccas ; for it feems there was a fuperftitious. report,
that wherever the body of Alexander was laid, that
country Ihould flourilh moft. Perdiccas, therefore, out
of regard to his native foil, would have it conveyed to
the royal fepulchres in Macedon j but Aridaeus, plead¬
ing the late king’s exprefs diredlion, was determined to
carry it into Egypt, from thence to be conveyed to the
temple of Jupiter Ammon.— I he funeral was accord¬
ingly conduced wdth all imaginable magnificence.
Ptolemy came to meet the body as far as Syria : but,
inltead of burying it in the temple ot Jupiter Ammon,
erefted a ftately temple for it in the city of Alexan¬

Matters now feemed to wear a better afpeft than

of Alexander’s captains at hand, to be pretettor and
governor of Macedon. This failed not to difguft his
fon Caffander ; who thought he had a natural right to
thefe offices, and of courfe kindled a new civil war in
Macedon. This ivas indeed highly promoted by his
firft actions as a governor. He began with attempt¬
ing to remove all the governors appointed in Greece
by Antipater, and to reftore democracy wherever it
had been abolilhed. The immediate confequence of
this was, that the people refufed to obey their magi-
ftrates j the governors refufed to refign their places,
and applied for afliftance to Caffander. Polyfperchoit
alfo had the imprudence to recal Olympias from Epi¬
rus, and allow her a ihare in the adminiftration •, which
Antipater, and even Alexander himfelf, had always
refufed her. The confequence of all this was, that
Caffander invaded Greece, where he prevailed againft
Polyfperchon : Olympias returned to Macedon, where
flie cruelly murdered Aridams and!;his wife Eurydice ;
lire herfelf was put to death by Caffander, who after¬
wards caufed Roxana and her fon to be murdered, and
Polyfperchon being driven into Etolia, firft raifed to
the crown Hercules the fon of Alexander by the daugh¬
ter of Darius,- and then by the inftigation of Caffandet
murdered him, by w’hich means the line of Alexander
the Great became totally extinft. I2s
Caffander having thus deftroyed all the royal family, Various re-
affumed the regal title, as he had for 16 years before y°h‘tl0ns
had all the power. He enjoyed the title of king
Macedon only three years 5 after which he died, about
298 B. C. By Theffalonica, the daughter of Philip
king of Macedon, he left three fons, Philip, Antipa¬
ter, and Alexander. Philip fucceeded him, but foon
after died of a confumption. A conteft immediately
began between the two brothers, Antipater and Alex¬
ander. Antipater feized the kingdom ; and to fecure
himfelf in it, murdered his mother Theffalonica, if
not with his own hand, at leaft the execrable a£t
was committed in his prefence. Alexander invited
Pyrrhus king of Epirus, and Demetrius the fon of
Antigonus, to aftift him and revenge the death of his
mother. But Pyrrhus being bought off, and a peace
concluded between the brothers, Alexander, being
afraid of having too many proteflors, formed a fcheme
of getting Demetrius affaffinated. Inftead of this, how¬
ever, both he and Antipater were put to death j and

Macedon. Dertiftrius became king of Macedon four
v the death of Caffandev. v
In 287 B. C. Demetrius was driven out by Pyrrhus,
who was again driven out by Lyfimachus two years
after, who was foon after killed by Seleucus Nicanor ;
and Seleucus, in his turn, was murdered by Ptolemy
Ceraunus, who became king of Macedon about 280
B. C. The new king was in a fhort time cut off, with
his whole aimy, by the Gauls; and Antigonus Gonatus,
the fon of Demetrius Poliorcetes, became king of Ma¬
cedon in 278 B. C. He proved fuccefsful againlt the
Gauls, but was driven out by Pyrrhus king of Epirus ;
who, however, foon difobliged his fubjecls to fuch a
degree, that Antigonus recovered a great part of his
kingdom. But in a little time, Pyrrhus being killed
at the liege of Argos in Greece, Antigonus was reftor-
ed to the whole of Macedon ; but fcarcely was he
feated on the throne, when he was driven from it by
Alexander the fon of Pyrrhus. This newT invader was,
in his turn, expelled by Demetrius the fon of Antigo-
nus; who, though at that time but a boy, had almoft
made himfelf mailer of Epirus. In this enterprife,
however, he wTas di (appointed ; but by his means An¬
tigonus was rellored to his kingdom, which he.govern¬
ed for many years m peace. By a Hratagem he made
himfelf mailer of the city of Corinth, and from that
time began to form fchemes for the thorough conquell
of Greece. The method he took to accomplilh this
was, to fupport the petty tyrants of Greece againlf
the free hates : which indeed weakened the power of
the latter ; but involved the whole country in fo many
calamities, that thefe tranfadlions could not redound
much to the reputation either of his arms or his ho¬
nour. About 243 B. C. be died, leaving the king¬
dom to his fon, Demetrius II.
Neither Demetrius, nor his fucceffor Antigonus Do-
fon, performed any thing remarkable. In 22 1 B. C.
the kingdom fell to Philip, the lall but one of the Ma¬
cedonian monarchs. To him Hannibal applied for
aliilfance after the battle of Cannae, which he refufed ;
and the fame imprudence which made him refufe this
affiftance prompted him to embroil himfelf with the
Romans ; and at laft to conclude a treaty with them, by
which he in effefl became their fubjefl, being tied up
from making peace or war but according to their plea-
fure. In 179 B. C. he was liicceeded by his eldell fon
Perfeus, under whom the war with the Romans was re¬
newed. Even yet the Macedonians were terrible in
war; and their phalanx, when properly conduced, feems
to have been abfolutely invincible by any method of
making war known at that time. It confided of
26,000 men, of whom 1000 marched abrealf, and thus
was 16 men deep, each of whom carried a kind of
pike 23 feet long. The foldiers flood fo clofe, that
the pikes of the fifth rank reached their points beyond
the front of the battle. The hindermofl ranks leaned
their pikes on the fhoulders of thofe who went before
them, and, locking them fall, preffed brilkly againlt
them when they made the charge ; fo that the firlt five
ranks had the impetus of the whole phalanx, which
was the reafon why the fhock was generally irrefiltible.
The Romans had never encountered fuch a terrible
enemy ; and in the firll battle, which happened 171
B. C. they were defeated with the lofs of 2200 men,
while the Macedonians loft no more than 60. The ge-

years after nerals of Pei bus now preffed him to ftorra the enemy’s Macedo:
camp : but he being naturally of a cowardly difpofi-
tion, refufed to comply, and thus the bell opportunity
he ever had was loll. Still, however, the Romans gain¬
ed little or no advantage, till the year 168 B. C. when
Paulus iEmilius, a moll experienced commander, was
fent to Macedon. Perfeus norv put all upon the iffue of
a general engagement ; and ^Emilius, with all his cou¬
rage and military experience, would have been defeat¬
ed, had the Macedonians been commanded by a gene¬
ral of the fmallelf courage or condufl. The light¬
armed Macedonians charged with fuch vigour, that
after the battle, fome of their bodies were found with¬
in two furlongs of the Roman camp. When the pha¬
lanx came to charge, the points of their fpears linking
into the Roman fhields, kept the heavy-armed troops
from making any motion ; while, on the other hand,
Perfeus’s light-armed men did terrible execution. On
this occafion, it is faid, that iEmilius tore his clothes,
and gave up all hopes However, perceiving that as
the phalanx gained ground it loft its order in feveral
places, he caufed his own light-armed troops to charge
in thofe places, whereby the Macedonians were foon
put into confufion. If Perfeus with his horfe had on
the firlt appearance of this charged the Romans brilk¬
ly, his infantry would have been able to recover them-
felves ; but inftead of this, he betook himfelf to flight,
and the infantry at lad did the fame, but not till
20,000 of them had loll their lives.
This battle decided the fate of Macedon, which
immediately fubmitted to the conqueror. The coward¬
ly king took refuge in the illand of Samothrace : but
was at lad obliged to furrender to the Roman conful,
by whom he was carried to Rome, led in triumph, and
afterwards moll barbaroully ufed. Some pretenders
to the throne appeared afterwards ; but being unable I30
to defend themfelves againll the Romans, the country Macedonia
was reduced to a Roman province in 148 B. C. To becomes a
them it continued fubje£l till the year X357, when it R-0111*11

MACHIAVEL, Nicholas, a famous political
writer of the 16th century, was born of a diflinguilh-
ed family at Florence. He wnote in his native lan¬
guage w’ith great elegance and politenefs, though he
underftood very little of the Latin tongue •, but he w’as
in the fervice of Marcellus Virgilius, a learned man,
who pointed out to him many of the beautiful paffages
in the ancients, which Machiavel had the art of pla¬
cing properly in his works. He compofed a comedy
upon the ancient Greek model : in which he turned
into ridicule many of the Florentine ladies, and which
w’as fo w’ell received, that Pope Leo X. caufed it to be
'adfed at Rome. Machiavel w^as fecretary, and after¬
wards hiftoriographer, to the republic of Florence.
The houfe of Medicis procured him this laft office,
together with a handiome falary, in order to pacify
his refentment for having fuffered the torture upon
fufpicion of being an accomplice in the conspiracy of
the Soderini againft that houfe, when Machiavel bore
his bufferings without making any confefiion. 'I he
great encomiums he beftowed upon Brutus and Caf-
fius, both in his converfations and writings, made him
ftrongly fufpeefed of being concerned in another con-
fpiracy againft Cardinal Julian de Medicis, who was
afterwards pope under the name of Clement VII. How¬
ever, they carried on no proceedings againft him j but
from that time he turned every thing into ridicule, and
5 ] MAC
gave himfelf up to irreligion. He. died in I5_3°> 3
remedy which he had taken by w7ay of prevention. Of|’ ac ^
all his waitings, that which has made the moft noife,
and has drawm upon him the moft enemies, is a politi¬
cal treatife entitled the Prince; which has been trani-
lated into feveral languages, and wrote againft by many
authors. The world is not agreed as to the motives
of this work fome thinking he meant to recommend
tyrannical maxims; others, that he only delineated
them to excite abhorrence. Machiavel alfo wrote, Re¬
flexions on Titus Livius, which are extremely curious j
The Hiftory of Florence, from the year 1205 to 1494}
and a quarto volume of Poems and other pieces. Mr
Harrington confiders him as a fuperior genius, and as
the moft excellent writer on politics and government
that ever appeared.
MACHINE, (Machina), in the general, fignifieS
any thing that ferves to augment or to regulate mov¬
ing pow’ers: Or it is any body deftined to produce
motion, fo as to fave either time or force. The wmrd
comes from the Greek A4«%«v>), “ machine, invention,
art And hence, in ftriXnefs, a machine is fomething
that confifts more in art and invention, than in the
ftrength and lolidity of the materials j for which rea-
fon it is that inventors of machines are called mgenieurs
or engineers.
Machines are either Ample or compound. The Am¬
ple ones are the feven mechanical powers, viz. lever,
balance, pulley, axis and wheel, wedge, icrew, and in¬
clined plane. See MECHANICS.
From thefe the compound ones are formed by various
combinations, and ferve for different purpoies. See
Mechanics •, alfo Agriculture, Cannon, Centri¬
fugal, Steam, Furnace, Burroughs, Ramsden,
&c. &c.
Machines ufed in w’ar amongft the Greeks were
principally thefe 1. or fealing ladders j
2. The battering ram j 3. The helcpohs ; 4. I he
or tortoife, called by the Romans tejludo \ 5. The o-gupx
or agqer, which was faced wuth ftone, and railed higher
than the w’all: 6. Upon the rxupet. were built wvgye< or
towers of wood ; 7. FsggaM, or oiler hurdles •, 8. Lata-
pnitre, or xaWsAV, from which they threw arrows
with amazing force j and, 9. The AiJhoooAa;, Tre-rps^oAai,
or xtph^ix, from which ftones were call with gieat ve¬
locity.
The principal warlike machines made ufe of by
the Romans were, the ram, the lupus or wolf, the
tejhido or tortoife, the balijla, the catapulia, and the
Jcorpion.
MACHINERY, in epic and dramatic poetry, is
when the poet introduces the ufe of machines ; or brings
fome fupernatural being upon the ilage, in order to
folve fome difficulty or to perform fome explojt out of
the reach of human power.
The ancient dramatic poets never made ufe of ma¬
chines, unlefs wdrere there w7as an j.bfolute neceffity tor ,
fo doing j whence the precept of Horace,
T!ec Deus interjit, nifi dignus vindice nodus
Incident.
It is quite otherwife writh epic poets, who introduce
machines in every part of their poems j lo that nothing
is done without the intervention of the gods. In Mil¬
ton’s Paradife Loft, by far the greater part of the ac¬
tors
MAC [ 326 ] MAC
Machul tors are fupernatural perfonages : Homer and Virgil do
M II . nothing without them and, in Voltaire’s Henriade, the
L.._ac_^enzKf' poet has made excellent ufe of St Louis.
As to the manner in which thefe machines fhould
add, it is fometimes invifibly, by Ample infpirations and
fuggeftions; fometimes by addually appearing under
fome human form *, and, laftly, by means of dreams
and oracles, which partake of the other two. How¬
ever, all thefe fhould be managed in fiich a manner as
pj ^ to keep within the bounds of probability.
CCXCVIII MACHUL, an inftrument of mulic among the
'Hebrews. Kircher apprehends that the name was
given to two kinds of inilruments, one of the ftringed
and the other of the pulfatile kind. That of the
former fort had fix chords j though there is great rea-
fon to doubt whether an inftrument requiring the aid
of the hair-bow, and fo much refembling the violin,
be fo ancient. The fecond kind was of a circular form,
made of metal, and either hung round with little bells,
or furnifhed with iron rings fufpended on a rod or bar
that palled acrofs the circle. Kircher fuppofes that it
wTas moved to and fro by a handle fixed to it, and thus
emitted a melancholy kind of murmur.
MACHYNLETH, a town of Montgomeryfhire
in North Wales, 198 miles from London, and 32 from
Montgomery. It is an ancient town j and has a
market on Mondays, and fairs on May 16, June 26,
July 9, September 18, and November 25, for fheep,
horned cattle, and horfes. It is feated on the river
Douay, over which there is a large ftone bridge, which
leads into Merionethfhire. It was here that Owen
Glyndwr exercifed the firft a6ts of his royalty in 1402.
Here he accepted the crown of Wales, and affembled a
parliament ; and the houfe wherein they met is now
handing, divided into tenements.
MACKENZIE, Sir George, an able lawyer,
a polite fcholar, and a celebrated wit, was born at
Dundee in the county of Angus in Scotland in 1636,
and Itudied at the univerfities of Aberdeen and St An¬
drew’s *, after which he applied himfelf to the civil law,
travelled into France, and profecuted his ftudy in that
faculty for about three years. At his return to his
native country he became an advocate in the city of
Edinburgh ; and foon gained the charadter of an emi¬
nent pleader. He did not, however, fuffer his abili¬
ties to be confined entirely to that province. He had
a good tafle for polite literature $ and he gave the pub¬
lic, from time to time, inconteftable proofs of an un¬
common proficiency therein. He had pradlifed but a
few' years, when he was promoted to the office of a
judge in the criminal court 5 and, in 1674, was made
king’s advocate, and one of the lords of the privy coun¬
cil in Scotland. He w'as alfo knighted by his majefty.
In thefe ftations he met w’ith a great deal of trouble,
on account of the rebellions which happened in his
time ; and his office of advocate requiring him to adt
with feverity, he did not efcape being cenfured, as if
in the deaths of fome particular perfons who were exe¬
cuted he had firetched the law's too far. But there
does not feem to have been any jufi foundation for this
clamour againfi: him ; and it is generally agreed, that
he acquitted himfelf like an able and upright magi-
firate. Upon the abrogation of the penal law’s by
King James II. our advocate, though he had always
been remarkable for his loyalty, and even cenfured for
1
his zeal againfi; traitors and fanatics, thought himfelf Mackerel,
obliged to refign his polt •, being convinced, that he Maclaurin.
could not difcharge the duties of it in that point with a v ^ f
good confcience. But he was foon after reftored,
and held his offices till the Revolution j an event which,
it feems, he could not bring himfelf to approve. He
had hoped that the prince of Orange would have re¬
turned to his own country when matters were adjufted
between the king and his fubje£ts j and upon its prov¬
ing otherwife, he quitted all his employments in Scot¬
land, and retired into England, refolving to fpend the
remainder of his days in the univerfity of Oxford. He
arrived there in September 1689, and profecuted his
ftudies in the Bodleian library, being admitted a flu-
dent there by a grace paffed in the congregation, June
2. 1690. In the fpring following, he went to Lon¬
don j where he fell into a diforder, of which he died
in May 1691. His corpfe was conveyed by land to
Scotland, and interred there wfith great pomp and fo-
lemnity. “ The politenefs of his learning, and the
fprightlinefs of his wit, were (fays the reverend Mr
Granger) confpicuous in all his pleadings, and {hone
in his ordinary converfation.” Mr Dryden acknow¬
ledges, that, he was unacquainted with what he calls the
beautiful turn of 'ipords and thoughts in poetry^ till they
were explained and exemplified to him in a converfa¬
tion with that noble wit of Scotland Sir George Mac¬
kenzie.-—He wrote feveral pieces of hiftory and anti¬
quities ; Inftitutions of the laws of Scotland ; Elfays
upon various fubjedls, &c. His works were printed
together at Edinburgh in 1716, in 2 vols. folio.
MACKEREL. See Scomber, Ichthyology//mfcr.
MACLAURIN, Colin, a mofi: eminent mathema¬
tician and philofopher, was the fon of a clergyman, and
born at Kilmoddan in Scotland in 1698. He was fent
to the univerfity of Glafgow in 1709 •, where he con¬
tinued five years, and applied himfelf to ftudy in a
moft intenfe manner. His great genius for mathema¬
tical learning difcovered itfelf fo early as at twelve
years of age; when, having accidentally met with an
Euclid in a friend’s chamber, he became in a few days
matter of the firft fix books without any affiftance :
and it is certain, that in his 16th year he had invent¬
ed many of the propofitions which were afterwards
publifhed under the title of Geometria Organica. In
his 15th year he took the degree of mafter of arts; on
which occafion he compofed and publicly defended a
thefis On the power of Gravity, with great applaufe.
After this he quitted the univerfity, and retired to a
country-feat of his uncle, who had the care of his
education ; for his parents had been dead fome time.
Here he {pent two or three years in purfuing his fa¬
vourite ftudies 5 but, in 1717, he offered himfelf a
candidate for the profefforffiip of mathematics in the
Marifchal college of Aberdeen, and obtained it after
a ten days trial with a very able competitor. In 1719,
he went to London, where he became acquainted witji
Dr Hoadly then biffiop oi Bangor, Dr Clarke, Sir
Ifaac Newton, and other eminent men 5 at which time
alfo he was admitted a member of the Royal Society j
and in another journey in 1721, he contradled an in-
timacyfwith Martin Folkes, Elq. the prefident of it,
which lafted to his death.
In 1722, Lord Polwarth, plenipotentiary of the king
of Great Britain at the congrcfs of Cambray, engaged
him
MAC
Maclaurin. Kim to go as a tutor and companion to Kis eldeft fen, who
i ».-v was t])en to fet out on hJg travels. After a fiiort flay at
Pan's, and vifiting other towns in France, they fixed
in Lorrain; where Maclaurin w’rote his piece On the
Percuffion of Bodies, which gained the prize of the
Royal Academy of Sciences for the year 1724. But
his pupil dying foon after at Montpelier, he returned
immediately to his profeihon at Aberdeen. He was
hardly fettled here, when he received an invitation to
Edinburgh •, the curators of that univerfity being de-
firous that he ihould fupply the place of Mr James
Gregory, whofe great age and infirmities had render¬
ed him incapable of teaching. He had fome difficul¬
ties to encounter, arifing from competitors, who had
good intereft with the patrons of the univerfity, and
alfo from the want of an additional fund for the new
profeffor ; which however at length were all furmount-
ed, principally by the means of Sir Ifaac Newton. In
November 1725, he was introduced into the univerfity.
After this, the mathematical claffes foon became very
numerous, there being generally upwards of 100 young
gentlemen attending his leflures every year •, who being
of different {landings and proficiency, he was obliged to
divide them into four or five claffes, in each of wffiich
he employed a full hour every day, from the firft of
November to the firft of June.
Pie lived a bachelor to the year 1733 : but being
not lefs formed for fociety than for contemplation, he
then married Anne, the daughter of Mr Walter Stew¬
art folicitor-general to his late majefty for Scotland.
By this lady he had feven children, of whom two fons
and three daughters, together with his wife, furvived
him. In 1734, Berkeley, biftiop of Cloyne, publilh-
ed a piece called “ The Analyft in which he took
occafion, from fome difputes that had arifen concern¬
ing the grounds of the fluxionary method, to explode
the method itfelf, and alfo to charge mathematicians
in . general wdth infidelity in religion. Maclaurin
thought himfelf included in this charge, and began an
anfwer to Berkeley’s book : but, as he proceeded, fo
many difeoveries, fo many new theories arid problems
occurred to him, that inflead of a vindicatory pamph¬
let, his work came out, A complete fyftem of fluxions,
with their application to the moft confiderable pro¬
blems in geometry and natural philofophy. This wrork
was publifhed at Edinburgh in 1742, 2 vols. 410 •, and as
it coft him infinite pains, fo it is the moft confiderable
of all his works, and will do him immortal honour.
In the mean time, he was continually obliging the
public with fome performance or obfervation of his
own •, many of which were publiffied in the fifth and
fixth volumes of the “ Medical EtTays” at Edin¬
burgh. Some of them wrere likewdfe publilhed in the
Philofophical Tran factions ; as the following : 1. Of
the conftruftion and meafure of curves, N° 356.

In the midft of thefe ftudies, he was always ready
to lend his affiftance in contriving and promoting any
fcheme which might contribute to the fervice of his
country. When the earl of Morton fet cut in 1739
for Orkney and Shetland, to vifit his eftates there,
he defired Mr Maclaurih to affift him in fettling the
geography of thofe countries, which is very errone¬
ous in all our maps 5 to examine their natural hiflory,
to furvey the coafts, and to take the meafure of a de¬
gree of the meridian. Maclaurin’s family affairs, and
other connexions, would not permit him to do this ;
he drew, however, a memorial of what he thought
neceffary to be obferved, furnifhed the proper inftru-
ments, and recommended Mr Short,. the famous op¬
tician, as a fit operator for the management of them.
He had ftill another fcheme for the improvement of
geography and navigation, of a more extenfive nature;
wffiich wjas the opening a paffage from Greenland to
the South fea by the north pole. That fuch a paf¬
fage might be found, he was fo fully perfuaded, that
he has been heard to fay, if his fituation could admit
of fuch adventures, he wmuld undertake the voyage, .
even at his own charge. But when fchemes for finding
it w^ere laid before the parliament in 1744, and him¬
felf confulted by feveral per fons of high rank concern¬
ing them, before he could finilffi the memorials he pro-
pofed to fend, the premium was limited to the difeo-
very of a north-weft paffage : and he ufed to regret,
that the word weft w^as inferted, becaufe he thought
that paffage, if at all to be found, muft lie not far from
the pole.
In 1745, having beer) very a6tive in fortifying the
city of Edinburgh againft the rebel army, he was obli¬
ged to fly from thence to the north of England ;
where he was invited by Herring, then archbiftiop of
York, to refide wuth him during his flay in this coun¬
try. In this expedition, however, being expofed to
cold and hardftrips, and naturally of a weak and ten¬
der conftitution, he laid the foundation of an illnefs
which put an end to his life, in June 1746, at the age
of 48.
Mr Maclaurin was a very good as wTell as a very
great man, and wTorthy of love as well as admiration.
His peculiar merit as a philofopher was, that all his
ftudies wrere accommodated to general utility ; and we
find, in many places of his wmrks, an application even
of the moft abftrufe theories, to the perfedting of me¬
chanical arts. He had refolved, for the fame purpofe,
to compofe a courfe of practical mathematics, and to
refeue feveral ufeful branches of the fcience from the
bad treatment they often met with in lefs Ikilful hands.
But all this his death prevented ; unlefs we fhould
reckon, as a part of his intended work, the tranfiation
of Dr David Gregory’s “ Practical Geometry,”
which he revifed, and publilhed with additions, 1745.
In his lifetime, hov’ever, he had frequent opportuni¬
ties of ferving his friends and his country by his great
fkill. Whatever difficulty occurred concerning the
conftuufting or perfecting of machines, the working of
mines, the improving of manufactures, the conveying
of water, or the execution of any other public work,

—"V J ployed to terminate fome difputes of confequence that
had arifen at Glafgow concerning the gauging of vef-
fels; and for that purpofe prefented to the commilTion-
ers of excife two elaborate memorials, with their de-
monftrations, containing rules for which the officers
now aft. He made alfo calculations relating to the
provilion, now eftabliffied by law, for the children and
w-idows of the Scots clergy, and of the profeflors in
the univcrfities, entitling them to certain annuities and
fums, upon the voluntary annual payment of a certain
fum by the incumbent. In contriving and adjufting
this wife and ufeful fcheme, he beftowed a great deal
of labour, and contributed not a little towards bring¬
ing it to perfeftion. It may be faid of fuch a man,
that “ he lived to fome purpofe $” which can hardly
be faid of thofe, how uncommon foever their abilities
pnd attainments, who ipend their whole time in ahftraft
/peculations, and produce nothing to the real ufe and fer-
vice of their fellow7 creatures.
Of his works, we have mentioned his Geometria Or-
ganica, in which he treats of the defcription of curve
lines by continued motion. We need not repeat what
has been faid concerning his piece which gained the
prize of the Royal Academy of Sciences in 17 24. In
1740, the academy adjudged him a prize, which did
him Hill more honour, for folving the motion of the
tides from the theory of gravity j a queftion wffiich
had been given out the former year, without receiving
any folution. He had only ten days to draw this pa¬
per up in, and could not find leilure to tranfcribe a
fair copy ; fo that the Paris edition of it is incorreft.
He afterwards revifed the whole, and inferted it in
his Treatife of Fluxions \ as he did alfp the fuhftance
of the former piece. Thefe, wuth the Freatife of
Fluxions, and the pieces printed in the Philofophical
Tranfaftions, of which we have given a lilt, are all
the writings which our author lived to publith. Since
' his death, two volumes more have appeared ; his Al¬
gebra, r* J his Account of Sir Ifasic Newton’s Philo¬
fophical Difcoveries. His Algebra, though not finilh-
ed by himfelf, is yet allowed to be excellent in its
kind •, containing, in no large volume, a complete ele¬
mentary treatife of that fcience, as far as it has hither¬
to been carried. His Account of Sir Itaac Newton’s
Philofophy was occafioned in the following manner :
Sir Ifaac dying in the beginning of 1728, his nephew,
Mr Conduitt, propofed to publifh an account of his
life, and defired Mr Maclaurin’s affiflance. The lat¬
ter, out of gratitude to his great benefaftor, cheer¬
fully undertook, and foon finiffied, the hiltory of the
progrefs which philofophy had made before Sir Ifaac’s
time, and this was the firft draught of the work in
hand \ which not gomg forward, on account of Mr
Conduitt’s death, was returned to Mr Maclaurin.—
To this he afterwards made great additions, and left
it in the ftate in which it now appears. His main
defign feems to have been, to explain only thofe parts
ef Sir Ifaac’s philofophy which have been, and dill
are, controverted : and this is fuppofed to be the rea-
fon why his grand difeoveries concerning light and
colours are but tranfiently and generally touched upon.
For it is known, that ever fmee the experiments, on
which his doftrine of light and colours is founded,

not been contefted ; whereas his accounting for the —y-—"
celeftial motions, and the other great appearances of
nature, from gravity, is mifunderftood, and even ridi¬
culed by fome to this day.
MACQUER, Philippe, advocate of the parlia¬
ment of Paris, where he was born in 17 20, being
defeended from a refpeftable family. A weaknefs
in his lungs having prevented him from engaging in
the laborious exercifes of pleading, he dedicated him¬
felf to literary purfuits. His works are, 1. VAbrege
Chronologique de PHijloire KccleJiaJIique, 3 vols, 8vo.
written in the manner of the prdident Henault’s Hi-
dory of France, but not poffeffed of equal fpirit and
elegance. 2. Les Annales Romaines, 17565 8vo ; ano¬
ther chronological abridgement, and much better fup-
ported than the former. Into this work the author
has introduced every thing mod worthy of notice which
has been written by Saint Evremond, Abbe Saint-
Real, Prefident Montefquieu, Abbe Mably, &c. con¬
cerning the Romans \ and, if we except a difference of
dyle, which is eafily difcernible it is, in other refpefts,
a very judicious compilation. 3. Abrege Chronologique
de VHiJloire d'Efpagne et de Portugal, 1759, 1765, in
2 vols, 8vo. This book, in point of accuracy, is
worthy of the prefident Henault, by whom it was be¬
gun j but it difplays no diferimination of charafter nor
depth of refearch. The author received affidance from
M. Lacombe, whofe talents for chronological abridge¬
ment are well known. The republic of letters fudain-
ed a lofs by the death of M. Macquer, which happen¬
ed on the 27th of January 1770, at the age of 50. As
to his charafter, he was indudrious, agreeable, moded,
and fincere, and an enemy to all fooliih vanity and af-
feftation. He had a cold imagination, but a correft
tade. He had an eager third for knowledge of every
kind, and he had neglefted no ufeful branch of dudy.
He had a diare in the Diftionary of Arts and Profef-
dons, in 2 vols 8vo, and in the Tranflation of the Sy¬
philis of Fracador published by Lacombe.
Macquer, Pierre Jofeph, brother to the former,
was born at Paris the 91b of Oftober 1718, and died
there February 16. 1784. He was a member of the
Academy of Sciences, and late profeffor of pharmacy j
and was engaged in the Journaldes Spavans, for the ar¬
ticles of medicine and chemidry. With the latter
fcience he was intimately acquainted. He had a
(hare in the Pharmacopoeia Parijienjis, publilhed in 1758,
in 410. His other works are, 1. Piemens de Chmne
theorique ; Paris, 1749, 1753, 1 2rao ; which have been
trandated into Englith and German.—2. Elemens dc
Cliimiepratique, 1751. 2 vols 12mo. Thefe two works
were republiffied together, in 1756, in 3 vols. i2mo.
3. Plan (Pun cours de Chimie experimentale et raifonee,
1757, i2mo-, in the compofition of which he was
aflbeiated with M. Beaume. 4. Formula Medicamento-

Sole, 1763. 6. Diciionnaire de Chimie, contenant la
Theorie et la Pratique de cet art, 1766, 2 vols. 8vo ;
which has been trandated into German, with notes j
and into Englidi, with notes, by Mr Keir. Macquer
has, by his labours and writings, greatly contributed to
render ufeful an art which formerly tended only to rum
the health of the patient by foreign remedies, or to

„ Ph?--us- , MACRIN, Salmon, one of the beft Latin poets
of the 16th century, was born at Loudun. His true
name was John Salmon ; but he took that of Macnn,
from his being frequently fo called in ridicule by Fran¬
cis I. on account of his extraordinary leannefs. He
was preceptor to Claudius of Savoy, count of Tende j
' and to Honoi ius the count’s brother j and wrote fe-
veral pieces of poetry in lyric verfe, which wrere fo ad¬
mired, that he was called the Horace of his time. He
died of old age, at Loudun, in 1555.—Charles Macrin,
his fon, was not inferior to him as a poet, and furpaffed
him in his knowledge of the Greek tongue. He was
preceptor to Catharine of Navarre, the lifter of Henry
the Great; and perifhed in the maffacre on St Bartho-
lomew’s day in 1572.
MACROBII, a people of Ethiopia, celebrated
for their juftice, and the innocence of their man¬
ners : alfo a people in the ifland Meroe. The Hyper¬
boreans were alfo called Macrobii: They generally

they obtained their name /3ia;, long life.')
MACROBIUS, Ambrosius Aurelius Theodo¬
sius, an ancient Latin writer, who flourilhed towards
the latter part of the fourth century.— Of what coun¬
try he was, is not clear: Erafmus, in his Ciceronianus,
feems to think he was a Greek ; and he himfelf tells
us, in the preface to his Saturnalia, that he was not a
Roman, but laboured under the inconveniences of
writing in a language which was not natural to him.
Of what religion he was, Chriftian or Pagan, is uncer¬
tain. Barthius ranks him among the Chriftians ; but
Spanheim and Fabricius fuppofe him to have been a
heathen. This, however, is certain, that he was a
man of confular dignity, and one of the chamberlains
or mafters of the wardrobe to Theodofius ; as appears
from a refcript direfted to Florentius, concerning thofe
who were to obtain that office. He wmote a Commen¬
tary upon Cicero’s Somnium Scipionis, and feven books
of Saturnalia, which treat of various fubjedls, and are
an agreeable mixture of criticifm and antiquity. He
w7as not an original writer, but made great ufe of other
people’s works, borrowing not only their materials, but
even their language, and for this he has been fatirically
rallied by fome modern authors, though rather unfairly,
confidering the exprefs declaration and apology which
he makes on this head, at the very entrance of his
work. “ Don’t blame me,” fays he, “ if what I have
colledled from multifarious reading, I (hall frequently
exprefs in the very words of the authors from whom I
have taken it : for my view in this prefent work is,
not to give proofs of my eloquence, but to colledt and
digeft into fome regularity and order fuch things
as I thought might be ufeful to be known. I fhall
therefore here imitate the bees,'w7ho fuck the beft: juices
from all forts of dowers, and afterwards work them
up into various forms and orders with fome mixture of
their own proper fpirit.” The Somnium Scipionis and
Saturnalia have been often printed $ to which has been
added, in the later editions, a piece entitled De Differen-
tiis et Societatibus Graci Latinique Verbi.
MACROCEPHALUS (compounded of fxctx^
u great,” and zitpuAn “ head,”) denotes a perfon with
Vol. XII. Part L
a head larger or longer than the common fize. Ma- Macroce-
crocephali, or Long-heads, is a name given to a cer* ''1 s
tain people, who, according to the accounts of authors, |\7acrooirvp.
were famous for the unfeemly length of their heads : / - "■ J
yet cuftom fo far habituated them to it, that inftead of
looking on it as a deformity, they efteemed it a beauty,
and, as foon as the child was born, moulded and fa-
Ihioned its head in their hands to as great a length as
poflible, and afterwards ufed all fuch rollers and band¬
ages as might feem moft likely to determine its grow¬
ing long. The greater part of the iffanders in the
Archipelago, fome of the people of Affa, and even
fome of thofe of Europe, ftill prefs their children’s
heads out lengthwife. We may obferve alfo, that the
Epirots, many people of America, &c. are all bom
with fome Angularity in the conformation of their
heads*, either a flatnefs on the top, twro extraordinary
protuberances behind, or one on each fide 5 Angularities
which we can only regard as an effeft of an ancient and
ft range mode, which at length is become hereditary in
the nation. According to the report of many travel¬
lers, the operation of compreftmg the head of a child
lengthwife, while it is yet foft, is with a view infen-
fibly to enlarge the interval between the tw:o eyes, fo
that the vifual rays turning more to the right and left,
the fight would embrace a much larger portion of the
horizon ; the advantage of which they are well ac¬
quainted with, either in the conftant exercife of hunt¬
ing, or on a theufand other occafions. Ever fince the
16th century, the miffionaries eftablilhed in the coun¬
tries inhabited by the favages of America, have en¬
deavoured to deftroy this cuftom *, and we find in the
feffions of the third council of Lima, held in 1585? a
canon which exprefsly prohibits it. But if it has been
repreffed one wray, the free negroes and Maroons, al¬
though Africans, have adopted it, fince they have
been eftabiilhed among the Caribs, folely with the
view of diftinguithing their children, which are born
free, from thofe who are born in ftavery. The Oma-
quas, a people of South America, according to P.
Veigh, prefs the heads of their children fo violently
between two planks that they become quite lharp at
the top, and flat before and behind. They fay they
do this to give their heads a greater refemblance to
the moon.

in the barony of Mufkerry, county of Cork, and pro¬

MACTATIO, in the Roman facrifices, fignifies
the adl of killing the vidfim. This was performed
either by the prielt himfelf, or fome of his inferior
officers, whom w7e meet with under the names ofpopa,
agones, culirarii, and uicUmarii; but, before the beaft
w as killed, the prieft, turning himfelf to the eaft, drew
a crooked line with his knife, from the forehead to
the tail. Among the Greeks, this ceremony was per¬
formed moll commonly by the prieft, or, in his abfence,
by the molt honourable perfon prefent. If the facri-
fice was offered to the celeltial gods, the vidtim’s
throat was bent up towards heaven •, if to the infer¬
nal, or to heroes, it was killed with its throat towards
the ground. The manner of killing the animal w'as
by a ftroke on the head, and, after it wras fallen,
thruding a knife into its throat. Much notice wras
taken, and good or ill fuccefs predidted, from the
firuggles of the beall, or itsr quiet fubmiffion to the

MADAGASCAR, the largeft of the African
iflands, is fituated between 430 and 510 of E. Long,
and between 12° and 26° of S. Lat. ; extending in
length near 1000 miles from north-north-eaft to fouth-
fouth-weft, and about 300 in breadth w here broadeft.
It was difeovered in 1506 by Laurence Almeyda \ but
the Perfians and the Arabians were acquainted with it
from time immemorial under the name of Serandib.
Alphonzo Albuquerque ordered Ruy Pereira dy Con-
thinto to vilit the interior parts, and that general in¬
truded Tritlan d’Acunha with the furvey. The Por-
tuguefe called it the ifland of St Lawrence ; the Trench
who vifited it in the reign of Henry IV. named it IJle
Dauphine; its proper name is Madegaffe. It is now,
however, by common confent, called Madagafcar.
This large ifland, according to many learned geo¬
graphers, is the Cerne of Pliny, and. the Menuthiafde
of Ptolemy. It is everywhere watered by large rivers,
dreams and rivulets, which have their fources at the
foot of that long chain of mountains which runs
through the whole extent of the ifland from ead to
wed. The two highed promontories are called Viva-
gora and Botijtmene.
Thefe mountains (according to the abbe Reckon*)
enclofe within their bofoms a variety of precious mine- Madagaf-
rals and ufeful foffils. The traveller (who for the Aril car-
time rambles over favage and mountainous countries, v
interfedled with valleys and with hills, where nature left
to herlelf brings forth the mod lingular and the mo't
varied productions) is involuntarily lurprifed and ter¬
rified at the fight of precipices, the fummits of which
are crowned with monilrous trees, that feem coeval
with the world. His adonilhment is redoubled at the
noife or thofe grand cafcades, the approach to which
is generally inacceffible. But to thofe view7s fo fub-
limely pi&urefque, rural feenes foon fucceed ; little
hills, gently riling grounds, and plains, the vegetation
of xvhich is never repreffed by the intemperance or the
viciflitude of the feafons. The eye contemplates with
pleafure thofe vad favannas which nourifh numberlefs
herds of bullocks and of (heep. You behold a flou-
riihing agriculture, produced almod folely by the fer¬
tilizing womb of nature. The fortunate inhabitants
of Madagafcar do not bedew the earth with their
fweat they fcarcely dir the ground with a rake, and
even that flight preparation is fufficient. They ferape
little holes at a fmall didance from each other, into
which they fcatter a few grains of rice, and cover them
with their feet ; and fo great is the fertility of the foil,
that the lands fovvn in this carelefs manner produce a
hundred fold.
The foreds prefent a prodigious variety of the mod
ufeful and the mod beautiful trees ; ebony, wood for
dying, bamboos of an enormous thicknefs, and palm
trees of every kind. The timber employed in Ihip-
building is no lefs common than thofe kinds fo much
prized by the cabinetmaker. We are told by the
French governor Flacourt, in his hidory of this iflandf, j ^
that in the year 1650 he fent to France 52,000 weight Grawi IJle
of aloes of an excellent quality. All of thefe various ^
trees and duubs are furrounded by an infinite numberrans 1 *
of parafitical plants j muffirooms of an infinite diverfity
of kinds and colours are to be met with everywhere in
the woods; and the inhabitants know well how to di-
dinguiflr thofe which are prejudicial to the health.
They collect large quantities of ufeful gums and refins j
and out of the milky fap of a tree, denominated by them
Jinguiore, the inhabitants, by means of coagulation,
make that lingular fubdance known to naturalills by
the name of gum elajlic. (See Caoutchouc and Ja-
TROPHA.)
Befides the aromatic and medicinal herbs which a-
bound in the foreds, the ifland produces flax and hemp
of a length and drength which furpafs any in Europe.
Sugar-canes, wax, honey of different kinds, tobacco,
indigo, white pepper, gum-lac, ambergris, filk, and cot¬
ton, would long fince have been objefts of commerce
which Madagafcar would have yielded in profufion, if
the Europeans, in vifiting the ifland, had furniffied
the inhabitants with the neceffary information for pre¬
paring and improving thefe feveral produflions.
The fugar-canes (as we are informed by another tra¬
veller;};) are much larger and finer than any in the Wed l Ives's'
Indies 5 being as thick as a man’s wrid, and fo full of Voyage to
juice, that a foot of them will weigh two pounds.
When the natives travel, they carry a fugar-cane along
with them, which will fupport them for two or three
days. Here are alfo plenty of tamarinds *, and fuch
quantities of limes and oranges, that very large calks
may
MAD [ 35
Madagaf- ttiay be filled with their juices at a trilling expence, as
car- they may be purchafed for iron pots, mufkets, powder,
1 v ' ball, &c. During the fliort time that Admiral Wat-
fon’s fquadron ftaid here in 1754, Mr Ives preferved
about half a hogfnead full of thofe juices, w^hich prov¬
ed afterwards of the greateft fervice to the fhips crews.
It muft be obferved, however, that no good water is
to be had at St Auguftine in the fouth-weft part of the
ifland, wdiere fnips ufually touch, unlefs boats are fent
for it four or five miles up the river j and inftead of
filling their calks at low w7ater (as is the cafe in moft
other rivers), they muft begin to fill at about a quarter’s
flood : The reafon affigned for this is, that the river
has a communication with the fea at other places be-
fides this of St Auguftine’s bay •, and it has been found
by experience, that the fea water brought into the river
by the flood tide is not difcharged till a quarter’s flood
of the next tide in St Auguftine’s bay j and for three
miles up the river, the water is always very brackiih, if
not quite fait.
The abundance and variety of provifions of every
kind, which a fine climate and fertile foil can produce,
are on no part of the globe, according to M. Rochon,
fuperior to thofe of Madagafcar: game, wild-fowl,
poultry, filh, cattle, and fruits, are alike plentiful. T-he
oxen, Mr Ives alfo informs us, are large and fat, and
have each a protuberance of fat between the (boulders,
■weighing about 20 pounds. Their flelh is greatly
efteemed by all the European nations trading to In¬
dia, and (hips are fent to Madagafcar on purpofe to
kill and fait them on the ifland. The protuberance
of fat above mentioned is particularly efteemed after
it has lain feme time in fait ; but our author fays,
that he could not join in the encomiums either on this
piece or the beef in general; as the herbage on which
the creatures feed gives their flelh a particular tafte,
which to him wTas difagreeable. The flieep differ little
from the goats ; being equally hairy, only that their
heads are fomewhat larger : their necks referable that
of a calf, and their tails w^eigh at leaft ten pounds.
Vaft quantities of locufts rife here from the low lands
in thick clouds, extending fometimes to an incredible
length and breadth. The natives eat thefe infefls, and
even prefer them to their fineft filh. Their method
of dreffing them is to ftrip off their legs and wings,
and fry them in oil.
The inhabitants (termed Melagaches or Madecaffes'),
M. Rochon informs us, are in perfon above the middle
lize of Europeans. The colour of the Ikin is different
in different tribes : among fome it is of a deep black,
among others tawny; fome of the natives are of a copper
colour, but the complexion of by far the greateft number
is olive. All thofe who are black have woolly hair like
the negroes of the coaft of Africa : thofe, on the other
hand, who referable Indians and Mulattoes, have hair
equally ftraight with that of the Europeans 5 the nofe
is not broad and flat •, the forehead is large and open ;
in Ihort, all the features are regular and agreeable.
Their phyfiognemy difplays the appearance of frank-
nefs and of fatisfaflion •, they are defirous only of learn¬
ing fuch things as may adminifter to their neceftitics *,
that fpecies of knowledge which demands refleflion is
indifferent to them : fober, agile, aflive, they fpend the
greateft part of their time either in deep or in amufe-
ment. In fine, according to the Abbe, the native of
i ] M A D
Madagafcar, like favagesin general, poffeffes a characler IWaciagai-
equally devoid of vice and of virtue j the gratifications,
of the prefent moment folely occupy his reiledtions ;
he poffeffes no kind of forefight whatever 5 and he can¬
not conceive the idea that there are men in the world
who trouble themfelves about the evils of futurity.
The population of the ifland has been eftimated at
four millions j but this calculation is thought exag¬
gerated by our author, and indeed it appears incredible
to us. Every tribe or fociety inhabits its own can¬
ton, and is governed by its oivn cuftoms. Each of
thefe acknowledges a chief; this chief is fometimes
ele£tive, but more ufually hereditary. The lands are
not divided and portioned out, but belong to thofe
who are at the trouble of cultivating them. Thefe
iflanders make ufe of neither locks nor keys j the
principal part of their food confifts in rice, filh, and
flelh ; their rice is moiftened with a foup which is fea-
foned with pimento, ginger, faftron, and aromatic
herbs. They difplay wonderful cunning in catching
a variety of birds, many of which are unknown in Eu¬
rope ; they have the pheafant, the partridge, the quail,
the pintado, the wild duck, teal of five or fix different
kinds, the blue hen, the black paroquet, and the turtle¬
dove, in great plenty j and alfo a bat of a monftrous
fize, which is much prized on account of its exquifite
flavour. Thefe laft are fo hideous in their appearance*
that they at firft terrify the European bailors : but after
they have vanquilhed their repugnance to them, they
prize their flefh infinitely before that of the pullets of
their own country. The Melag&ches alfo catch an im-
menfe quantity of fea-filh : fuch as the dorado, the
foie, the herring, the mackarel, the turtle, &c. with
oyfters, crabs, &c. The rivers afford excellent eels,
and mullets of an exquifite flavour.
The inhabitants near St Auguftine’s bay, Mr Ives
informs us, fpeak as much broken Englilh as enables
them to exchange their provifions for European ar¬
ticles. Thefe, on the part of the Melagaches are cattle,
poultry, milk, fruit, rice, fait, porcelain, potatoes,
yams, filh, lances, and (hells. From the Europeans
they receive mufleets, pow'der, bullets, flints, c/outies,
(including handkerchiefs, and linen of all kinds),
beads, iron pots, &c.—Silver, which they call mamla,
is in great efteem with them, and is made by them
into bracelets for their wives.
That part of the ifland at which the Englifh fqua¬
dron touched, is the dominions of the king of Baba,
who, by the account of Mr Ives, feemed greatly to
affeft to be an Englilhman. They had no fooner
touched at the ifland, than they were -waited on by one
called Robin Hood, and another perfon, both of whom
bore the office of purfers. Along with thefe were
PJii/ibey the general ; John Anderfon and Frederic
Martin, captains. Nor did the king himfelf and his
family difdain to pay them a vifit *, who, in like man¬
ner wTere diftinguiihed by Engliflr names •, the king’s
eldeft fon being called the prince of Wales, and the
court not being without a duke of Cumberland, a
prince Auguftus, princeffes, &c. as in England. All
thefe grandees came on board naked, excepting only
a flight covering about their loins and on their (boul¬
ders, made of a kind of grabs growing on the ifrnd ',
which they had adorned with fmall glals brads by way
of border or fringe. Their hair ic'embled that or the
T t 2 Indians
MAD f 332 ] MAD
Madagaf- Indians in be3n<^ long and black, ratber than tbe wool-
cai' ly beads of the African negroes. “ 'I'he wives of the
Pdelagnches (according to our author) take great pains
with their hufbands hair j foraetimes putting it in
large and regular curls ; at other times braiding it in
great order, and making it fhine with a particular oil
which the ifland produces. The men always carry in
their hands a wooden lance headed with iron, which
is commonly made very neat ; and they are fuch ex¬
cellent markfmcn, that they will ftrike with it a very
ifnall obje£l at 30 or 40 yards dillance. They have
alio commonly a muiket, which they get from Euro¬
peans in exchange for cattle, and are always fure to
keep in excellent order. 1 am forry to fay (continues
Mr Ives) that the English are frequently guilty of
great irnpofitions in this kind of traffic, by dilpofing
of cheap and ill-tempered barrels among the poor in¬
habitants, who fometimes lofe their lives by the buril-
tng of thefe pieces. Such iniquitous practices as
theie mutt in the end prove injurious to the nation •,
and has indeed already made the name of more than
one-half of thefe traders truly infamous among the de¬
luded but hitherto friendly Madagafcarians.
“ They are a civil and good-natured people, but
caiily provoked, and apt to ffiow their refentment on
the lead provocation, efpecially when they think
themielves injured or flighted. Another chara£terif-
tic of them is, the very high notions of dignity they
entertain of their king *, which is carried to fuch a
height, that they are never more fenfibly hurt than
when they imagine he is treated with incivility or dif-
refpedt. This mighty monarch refides in a town
built with mud, about 1 2 miles up the country from
St Auguftine’s bay. On the eaft fide of the bay, as
you enter, there refided one Pxdnce William, a rela¬
tion and tributary to the king •, but who in mofl cafes
aided as an independent prince, and always ufed his
utmoft endeavours with the officers to caufe them buy
their provifions from him, and not from the king or
his fubjefts. In this prince's territories, not far from
the fea, are the remains of a fort built by Avery the
pirate.
“ All the women of Madagascar, excepting the
very poorefl fort, wear a covering over their breads
and fhoulders, ornamented with glafs beads, and none
go wbthout a cloth about their loins. They common¬
ly walk with a long {lender rod or dick. The men
are allowed to marry as many women as they can
Support.
“ During our day at this ifland (fays Mr Ives), I
obferved with great concern, feveral miferable objefts
in the lad dage of the venereal difeafe. They had
not been -able to find any cure ; and as far as I could
learn, their doctors are totally ignorant of medicine.
The only method they ufe for curing all didempers,
as ■well external as internal, is the wearing on the arm
or neck a particular charm or amulet; or befmearing
the part affecled with earth moidened with the juice
of fome plant or tree, and made up into foft pade.
“ J took Some pains to learn their religious tenets j
and find that they worfhip one Univerfal Father •,
whom, when they fpeak in Englidi, they call God;
and in whom they conceive all kinds of perfe£Hon to
refide. The fun they look upon as a glorious body ;
and, I believe* as a Spiritual being, but created and
dependent. They frequently look up to it with won¬
der, if not with praife and adoration. They make
their Supplications to the One Almighty, and offer fa-
crifices to him in their didreffes. I had the curiofity
to attend a Sacrifice, at the hut of John Anderfon,
whofe father had for a long time been affiicled with
ficknefs. About funfet an ox was brought , into the
yard ; and the fon, who officiated as pried, flew it.
An altar was reared nigh, and the pod of it was
Sprinkled with the blood of the viclim. The head
after its being fevered from the body, was placed,
with the horns on, at the foot of the altar : the caul
was burned on the fire, and mofl of the pluck and en¬
trails boiled in a pot. The fick man, who was brought
to the door, and placed on the ground fo as to face
the lacrifice, prayed often, and feemingly with great
fervency. His eyes were fixed attentively towards the
heavens, and his hands held up in a Supplicating po-
dure. The ceremony ended with the fan's cutting up
the ox into Small pieces j the greated part of which
he diflributcd among tbe poor Slaves belonging to his
father and himfelf 5 referving, however, fome of the
bed pieces for his own ufe. Upon the whole, I faw
fo many circumflances in this Madagafcarian facrifice,
fo exactly refembling thofe defcribed in the Old Te-
flament as offered up by the Jews, that I could not
turn my thoughts back to the original, without being
fenfibly flruck by the e.\a£tnefs of the copy.”
When the Squadron firfl arrived at Madagafcar, the
king of Baba, a man of about 60 years of age, was
ill of the gout. Having demanded of Admiral Wat-
fon fome prefents, the latter complimented him, among
other things, with fome brandy. The monarch then
alked him if he had any doctor with him, and if he
was a great do£tor, and a king’s doctor ? To all which
being anfwered in the affirmative, he defired him to
bring fome mahomets (medicines) for his fick knee.
With this requifition Mr Ives defigned to comply}
but having waited until fome officers Should be ready
ta accompany him, his majefly, in the mean time,
took fuch a dofe of brandy as quickly fent the gout
into his head, and occafioned his death. Mr Ives ob-
ferves, that it happened very luckily for him that the
monarch’s deceafe happened without his having taken
any of the medicines intended for him, as it would
have been impoffible to avoid the imputation of hav¬
ing poifoned him, which would certainly have been re-
fented by his loyal fubjedfls.
The king’s death occafioned great confufion} the
grandees being defirous that it Should be concealed for
fome time. This,'" however, was found impoffible } op
which they fet off for the Mud Town about 11 o’clock
the fame evening. All the inhabitants of the village
followed their example} leaving only the dogs, who
fet up the mofl hideous howling. Captain Frederic
Martin coming to take leave of the Englifh, begged
with great earneflnefs for a freffi fupply of gunpow¬
der } whifpering that the king was dead, and that
they flrould in all probability go to war about making
another. They had been formerly told, that one who
had the title of duhe of Baba would certainly fucceed
to tbe throne } but they afterwards learned, that Phi-
libey the general having efpoufed the caufe of Ra-
phani the late king’s fon, and taken him under his tu,-
telage and prote&ion, this youth, who was only abcroj:
MAD [ 333 1 MAD
Madagaf- i($ vears of ago, fucceeded his father as king of
car* Baba.
™ The following is a defcription of the fouthern divi-
{ion of the illand, from the Abbe Rochon.
“ That part of Madagafcar in which Fort Dauphin
is fituated is very populous. Almoft all the xdllages
are placed on eminences, and furrounded with two rows
of llrong palifadoes, fomewhat in the manner of fuch
of our fences as are compofed of hurdles and turf.
Within, is a parapet of folid earth about four feet in
height *, large pointed bamboos placed at the dillance
of five feet from each other, and funk in a pit, form
a kind of loop-holes, which contribute towards the de¬
fence of thefe villages, fome of which are befides for¬
tified with a ditch ten feet in breadth and fix in
depth. The dwelling of the chief is called a donac.
When the chiefs go abroad, they are always provided
with a mulket and a Hick armed with iron, and adorn¬
ed at the extremity with a little tuft of cow’s hair.
They wear a bonnet of red wool. It is chiefly by the
colour of their bonnet that they are diftinguilhed from
their fubjedts. Their authority is extremely limited:
however, in the province of Carcanojfi, the lands by
cuttom belong to their chiefs, who diftiibute them a-
mong their iubjedls for the purpofes of cultivation ;
they exadf a trifling quit-rent in return, which in their
language is called faenfa. The people of Carcanoffi
are not altogether ignorant of the art of writing •, they
even poflefs fome hiftorical works in the Madagafcar
tongue : but their learned men, whom they term Om-
biq/Jes, make ufe of the Arabic characters alone. They
have treatifes on medicine, geomancy, and judicial a-
lirology $ the molt renowned live in the province of
Matatane; it is in that diflridt that magic ftill remains
in all its glory •, the Matanes are actually dreaded by
the other Madecaffees on account of their excellence
in this delufive art. The Ombiafles have public fchocls
in which they teach geomancy and aftrology. The
natives have undoubtedly learned the art of writing
from the Arabians, who made a conqueft of this ifland
about 300 years fince.
“ The people of the province of AnoJJ:, near Fort
Dauphin, are lively, gay, fenfible, and grateful 5 they
are pafiionately fond of women ; are never melancholy
in their company ; and their principal occupation is
to pleafe the fex *, indeed, whenever they meet their
wives, they begin to fing and dance. The women, from
being happy, are always in good humour. Their live¬
ly and cheerful characler is extremely pleafing to the
Furopeans. I have often been prefent at their aflem-
bhes, where affairs of importance have been agitated j
1 have obierved their dances, their fports, and their a*
mufcments, and I have found them free from thofe
exceffes which are but too common among polifhed
nations. Indeed I was too young as this time for my
obfervatxons to be of much weight j but if my experi¬
ence be infufficient to infpire confidence, I beg the
reader will rather confider the nature of things, than
the relations given by men without principles or intel¬
ligence, who fancy that they have a right to tyrannize
over the inhabitants of every country which they can
fubdue. If the people of Madagafcar have fometimes
availed themfelves of treachery, they have been forced
to it by the tyranny of the Europeans. y The weak
have no other arms againit the flrong. Could they
defend themfelves by any other means from our artil- Madagaf-
lery and bayonets ? They are uninformed and helplels 5 Ciir‘
and we avail ourfelves of their weaknefs, in order to
make them fubmit to our covetoufnefs and caprice.
They receive the mo A; cruel and oppreflive treatment,
in return for the hofpitality which they generoufly be¬
llow on us 5 and we call them traitors and cowards,
when we force them to break the yoke with which we
have been pleafed to load them.”
In the fecond volume of Count Benyowfky’s Me¬
moirs and Travels we have the following account of
the religion, government, See. of the people of this
illand.
“ The Pvtadagafcar nation believe in a Supreme Being,
whom they call Zaw/wre, which denotes creator of all
things. They honour and revere this Being j but
have dedicated no temple to him, and much lefs have
they fubftituted idols. They make facrifices, by kill¬
ing oxen and Iheep, and they addrefs all thefe libations
to God. It has been afferted, that this nation likewife
makes offerings to the devil: but in this there is a de¬
ception ; for the piece of the facrificed beaft which is
ufually thrown into the fire is not intended in honour
of the devil, as is ufually pretended. This cuflom is
very ancient, and no one can tell the true reafon of it.
With regard to the immortality of the foul, the Ma¬
dagafcar people are perfuaded, that, after their death,
their fpirit will return again to the region in which the
Zanhare dwells ; but they by no means admit that the
fpirit of man, after Ills death, can fuffer any evil. As
to the diftin&ion of evil or good, they are perfuaded
that the good and upright man ftiall be recompenfed,
in this life, by a good Hate of health, the conftancy
of his friends, the increafe of his fortunes, the obedi¬
ence of his children, and the happinefs of beholding-
the profperity of his family : and they believe that the
wicked man’s fate lhall be the contrary to this. The
Madagafcar people, upon this conviftion, when they
make oaths, add benedictions in favour of thole who
keep them, and curfes againit thofe who break them.
In this manner it is that they appeal to the judgement
of Zanhare, in making agreements-, and it has never
been known, or heard of, that a native of Madagafcar
has broken his oath, provided it was made in the ufual
manner, which they fay was preferibed by their fore¬
fathers.
“ As to their kings and form of government, &c.
the Madagafcar people have always acknowledged
the line of Ramini, as that to which the rights of Am-
panfacabe or fovereign belongs. They have confider-
ed this line as extinCl fince the death of Dian Rami-
r.i Larizon, which happened 66 years ago, and whofe
body was buried upon a mountain, out of which the
river Manangourou fprings ; but having acknowledged
the heir of this line on the female fide, they re-elta-
blilhed this title in the year 1776. The right of the'
Ampanfacabe confifts in nominating the Rohandrians
to aflift in the cabars^ at which all thofe who are cit¬
ed are bound to appear, and the judgement of the Am¬
panfacabe in his cabar is decifive. Another preroga¬
tive of the Ampanfacabe is, that each Rohandrian
is obliged to leave him by will a certain proportion
of his property, which the fucceffors ufually purchafe
by a flight tribute or fine. Thirdly, The Ampanfa¬
cabe has a right. to exacf from each Rohandrian one-/
tenth::
MAD C 334 ] MAD
tenth of the produce of his land, and a number of
horned cattle and Haves, in proportion to the riches of
the country poffefled by each Rohandrian. The fecond
order is compofed of the Rohandrians, or princes. Since
the lofs of the Ampanfacabe, three of thefe Rohan--
drians have aflumed the title of kings, namely the Ro¬
handrian of the province of Mahavelou, named Hiavi;
of the province of Voemar, named Lambouin ; and a
third at Bombetoki, named Cimanounpou. 7'he third
order confiils of the Voadziri, or lords of a diftridf,
compofed of feveral villages. The fourth order con-
fifts of the Lohavohits, or chiefs of villages. The
fifth order, Ondzatzi, who are freemen, compofe
the attendants or followers of the Rohandrians, Voad¬
ziri, or Lohavohits. The fixth order confifts of Om-
biafTes, or learned men ; and this order forms the war¬
riors, workmen, phyficians, and diviners: thefe laft
poffefs no charge. The feventh order confifts of Am-
purias or Haves.
“ Having made inquiries from Bombetoki patting to
the northward, and as far as Itapere, the refult proved
that there are 38 Rohandrians aftually reigning, and
287 Voadziri. With refpedl to the Lohavohits, Ond¬
zatzi, and Ombiaffes, it was not pOiTrble to obtain any
accurate determination of their number. Thefe or¬
ders preferve a regular gradation, refpedling which it
would be very difficult to give a detailed account.
They live in the manner we read of concerning the
ancient patriarchs. Every father of a family is prieft
and judge in his own houfe, though he depends upon
the Lohavohits, who fuperintends his condudl. This
lalf is anfwerable to his Voadziri, and the Voadziri to
"the Rohandrian.
“ The Madagafcar people having no communication
with the main land of Atthiopia, have not altered
their primitive laws ; and the language throughout
the whole extent of the iHand is the fame. It would
be a raffi attempt to determine the origin of this na¬
tion 5 it is certain that it confifts of three diftimfl
races, who have for ages paft formed intermixtures
which vary to infinity. The firft race is that of Zafe
Ibrahim, or defcendants of Abraham but they have
no veftige of Judaifm, except circumcifion, and feme
names, fuch as Ifaac, Reuben, Jacob, &.c. This race
is of a brown colour.— The fecond race is that of Za-
feramini : with refpeft to this, fome books which are
fiill extant among the Ombiaffes, affirm that it is
not more than fix centuries fince their arrival at Ma¬
dagafcar.—With refpedl to the third race of Zafe
Canambou, it is of Arabian extradlion, and arrived
much more lately than the others from the coafts of
./Ethiopia : hence it poffeffes neither power nor cre¬
dit, and fills only the charges of writers, hiftorians,
poets. &c.
“ In regard to arts and trades, the Madagafcar na¬
tion are contented with fuch as are nec^ffary to make
their moveables, tools, utenfils, and arms for defence ;
to conftmft their dwellings, and the boats which are
neceffary for their navigation 5 and laftly, to fabricate
cloths and Huffs for their clothing. They are de-
iirous only of poffeffing the neceffary fupplies of im¬
mediate utility and convenience, '('he principal and
moft refpe&ed bufinefs, is the manufinflure of iron
and fteel. The artifts in this way call themlelves am-
pn.nefa vihe. I hey are very expert in fuling the ore,
1
and forging utenfils, fuch as hatchets, hammers, an- Madagaf-
vils, knives, fpades, fagayes, razors, pincers or tweez- car.
ers for pulling out the hair, &c. The fecond clafs
confifts of the goldfmiths {ompanefa vo/a mena}-. they call;
gold in ingots, and make up bracelets, buckles, ear¬
rings, drops, rings, &.c. 7'he third are called ompavil-
langa,- and are potters. The fourth are the ompanevat-
la, or turners in wood, who make boxes called valla,
plates, wooden and horn fpoons, bee-hives, coffins, &c.
7'he fifth ompan cacafou, or carpenters. They are very
expert in this bufmefs, and make ufe of the rule, the
plane, the compaffes, &c. The fixth are the ompania-
vi, or ropemakers. They make their ropes of diffe¬
rent kinds of bark of trees, and likewife of hemp. 7'he
feventh, ampan lamba, or weavers. This bufinefs is
performed by women only, and it would be reckoned
difgraceful in a man to exercife it. The ombiajfes are
the literary men and phyficians, who give advice only.
The herauvit% are comedians and dancers.
“ The Madagafcar people always live in fociety j
that is to fay, in towns and villages. 7'he towns are
furrounded by a ditch and pallifades (as already men¬
tioned), at the extremities of which a guard of from 1 2
to 20 armed men is kept. The houfes of private peo¬
ple confift of a convenient cottage, furrounded by fe¬
veral fmall ones : the mafter of the houfe dwells in the
large!!, and his women or Haves lodge in the fmaller.
Thefe houfes are built of wood, covered with leaves of
the palm tree or ftraw.
“ 7'he houfes of the great men of the country are
very fpacious; each houfe is compofed of two walls
and four apartments : round about the principal houfe
other fmaller habitations are built for the accommoda¬
tion of the women, and the whole family of the chief j
but the Haves cannot pafs the night within them.—
Moft of the houfes inhabited by the Rohandrians are
built with tafte and admirable fymmetry.”
The French attempted to conquer and take poffef-
fion of the whole iHand, by order, and for the ufe of,
their Moft Chriftian Majefties Louis XIII. and XIV.
and they maintained a footing on it from the year
1642 to 1657. During this period, by the moft cruel
treachery, they taught the native princes the barbarous
traffic in fl.ives, by villanoufly felling to the Dutch go¬
vernor of Mauritius a number of innocent people, who
had been affifting them In forming a fettlement at
Fort Dauphin.
The Abbe Rodion tells us, that the infalubrity of the
air in PTadagafcar determined his countrymen in 1664
to quit that immenfe bland, in order to eftablilh them-
felves at fo inconfiderable a place as the ifle of Bour¬
bon, which is fcarcely perceptible in a map of the
globe : but it is apparent, from the account of the Hate
of the French affairs on the ifland of Madagafcar, in
1661, when Flacourt’s narrative was publiffied, that
their ill treatment of the natives had raifed fuch a ge¬
neral and formidable eppofition to their refidence in the
country, that the French were obliged to abandon their
poffeffions for other reafons than the unhealthy qualities
of the climate. We have not room here for a detail of
all the oppreffive meafures of the French, which the
abbe himfelf candidly cenfures in the ftrongeft terms •,
but ffiall extrad the following narrative, both becaufe
it is interefting in itfelf, and exhibits the caufes and the
means of their expulfion.

La Cafe, one of the French officers employed by
the governor of Fort Dauphin againft the natives,
was fo fuccefsful in all his enterprifes, that they called
him Deaan Pour, the name of a chief who had for¬
merly conquered the whole ifland. Ihe French go¬
vernor, jealous of his renown, treated him hardily, and
refufed to allow him the rank or honours due to his
valour. The fovereign of the province of Amboulle,
called Deaan Rafcitat, taking advantage of his difcon-
tent, prevailed on him to become his general. Five
Frenchmen followed him. Deaan Nong, the daugh¬
ter of Rafcitat, captivated by the perfon and heroilm
of La Cafe, offered him her hand with the confent of
her father. The chief, grown old, infirm, and arrived
at the lail: ftage of exidence, had the iatisfa61ion of
fecuring the happinefs of his fubje&s, by appointing
his fon-in-law abfolute mader of the rich province of
Amboulle. La Cafe, in marrying Deaan Nong, re¬
fufed to take the titles and honours attached to the
fovereign power : he would accept of no other cha-
rafter, than that of the fird fubjefl of his wife, who
was declared fovereign at the death of her father. Se¬
cure in the affesdion of this princefs, who was not
only poffeffed of perfonal charms, but of courage and
great qualities, he was beloved and refpebted by her
family, and by all the people of Amboulle, who reve¬
renced him as a father ; and yet, how much foever he
wifhed it, he was unable to contribute to the profperity
of his countrymen at Fort Dauphin, whom he knew to
be in the utmod didrefs. The governor, regarding
him as a traitor, had fet a price on his head, and on
the heads of the five Frenchmen who had followed
him. The neighbouring chiefs, irritated at this treat¬
ment of a man whom they fo much venerated, unani-
moufiy refufed to fupply the fort with provifions. This
occafioned a famine in the place, wrhich, with a conta¬
gious fever and other maladies, reduced the French gar-
rifon to 80 men.
The edablidiment at Fort Dauphin, on the point
of being totally dedroyed, was preferved for a fhort
time from ruin by the arrival of a veffel from France,
commanded by Kercadio an officer of Britanny, who,
with the affidance of a young advocate who had been
kidnapped on board the veffel, prevailed on the envi¬
ous and implacable governor Chamargou to make
peace with La Cafe and his fovereign fpoufe Deaan
Nong. This peace, however, laded but for a diort
time ; the French, redlefs and infolent to the neigh¬
bouring nations, again drew on them the vengeance
of the natives. Even the few friends whom they had
been able to acquire by means of La Cafe, w^re ren¬
dered hodile to them by the tyrannic zeal of the mif-
fionaries •, who, not contented w-ith being tolerated
and allowed to make converts, infided on Deaan Ma-
nang, fovereign of Mandrarey, a powerful, courageous,
and intelligent chief, well difpofed to the French, to
divorce all his wives but one. This prince, not con¬
vinced of the neceffity of fuch a meafure, affured them
that he wras unable to change his habits and w7ay
of living, which were thofe of his forefathers. “ You
would allow me (fays he) to have one wife ; but if
the poffeffion of one woman is a bleffing, why ffiould
a numerous feraglio be an evil, while peace and con¬
cord reign among thofe of wffiom it is compofed ?

foldiers, if he hefitated in complying
mands. It is eafy to imagine, fays M. Keen , witli
what indignation this language mud have been beard
in the domic or palace of this prince. The fsrmdcs af-
lailed the miffionary on all lides ; loaded him with ex¬
ecrations and blows $ and, in their fury, would doubt-
lefs have afforded him no more quarter than the Thra¬
cian women did Orpheus, if Deaan Manang, not'.vuh-
danding his own agitation, had not made ufe of all bis
authority to fave him.
In order to free himfelf from the perfecution of this
pried, he removed with his family 70 or 80 miles up
into the country; but he was foon followed by Father
Stephens and another miffionary, with their attendants.
The chief, Manang, dill received them civilly ; but he
intreated them no longer to infid on the converfion of
him and his people, as it was impeffible to oblige them
to quit the cudoms and manners of their ancedors.
The only reply which Father Stephen made to this
intreaty, was by tearing off the oli, and the amulets

his own religion ; and, throwing them into the fire, he
declared war againd him and his nation. This violence
indantly cod him and his followers their lives: they
wTere all maffacred by order of Manang, who vowed
the dedru61ion of all the French in theidand ; in which
intention he proceeded in a manner that has been re¬
lated by an eyewitnefs, who wTas afterwards provincial
commiffary of artillery, in a narrative publhhed at
Lyons in 1722, entitled, Voyage de Madagafcar. “ Our
yoke (fays the Abbe Rochon) was become odious and
infupportable. Hidorians, for the honour of civilized
nations, diould bury in oblivion the affiifling narratives
of the atrocities exercifed on thefe people, whom we
are pleafed to call barbarous, treacherous, and deceitful,
becaufe they have revolted againd European adventurers,
whofe lead crime is that of violating the facred rites of
hofpitality.”
It was about the year 1672 that the French were to¬
tally driven from the iiland of Madagafcar; and no
confiderable attempts were made to form fredi edablifh-
ments there till within thefe few7 years, by M. de Mo-
dave, and by Count Benyowlki; neither of which was .
attended with fuccefs, for reafons given by the Abbe,
but which we have not room to detail.

from which the red take their name, is about 55
Englidi miles long, and jo miles broad ; and was fird:
difeovered on the 2d of July, in the year 1419, by
Joao Gonzales Zarco, there being no hidorical founda¬
tion for the fabulous report of its difeovery by one
Machin an Englifhman. It is divided into two capi-
tanias, named Funchal and Maxico, from the towns of

v Funchal and Galhettaj the latter being a town with the
title of a county, belonging to the family of Caflello
Melhor. The fecond capitania likewife comprehends
two judicatures, viz. Maxico (read Malhico) and San
Vicente.
Funchal is the only citadel or city in the ifland,
which has alio feven villas or towns 5 of which there
are four, Calhctta, Camara de Lobos, Ribeira Braba,
and Ponta de Sol in the capitania of Funchal, which
is divided into 26 parilhes. The other three are in
the capitania of Maxico, which conlifts of 17 parilhes ;
thefe towns are called Maxico, San Vicente, and Santa
Crux.
There is one curiofity in the town of Funchal, which
deferves to be taken notice of, and that is a chamber
in one of the corners of the Francifcan convent, the
walls and ceiling of which are completely covered with
rows of human fkulls and human thigh bones, fo ar¬
ranged that in the obtufe angle made by each pair of
the latter, eroding each other obliquely, is placed a
Ikull. The only vacant fpace that appears is in the
centre of the fide oppofite to the door, on which there
is an extraordinary painting above a kind of altar, but
what the fubjedt it is intended to reprefent, it is difficult
to determine. A figure probably intended for St Fran¬
cis, the patron faint, feems to be intent on trying in a
balance the comparative weight of a {inner and a faint.
A dirty lamp fufpended from the ceiling, and juft glim¬
mering in the focket, ferves dimly to light up this dif-
mal den of fkulls. The monk who attends as (hew-
man, is careful to imprefs on the minds of thofe who
vifit it, the idea that they are all relicks of holy men
who died on the ifland, although Mr Barrow is of opi¬
nion that the church-yard muft have been frequently
robbed, in order to accumulate fuch a prodigious num¬
ber of Ikulls, which from a rough computation made
by that gentleman, could not be under 3000.
The governor is at the head of all the civil and mi-
litary departments of this ifland, of Porto-Santo, the
Salvages, and the Ilhas Defartas j which laft only con¬
tain the temporary huts of fome fifhermen, who refort
thither in purfuit of their bufinefs j his falary is com¬
puted to be vrorth 2000I. per annum, 200I. of which
is in the form of a prefent from the Englifti mer¬
chants.
The law department is under the corregidor, wffio is
appointed by the king of Portugal, commonly fent
from Lilhon, and holds his place during the king’s
pleafure. All caufes come to him from inferior courts
by appeal. Each judicature has a fenate ; and a Juita
or judge, whom they choofe, prefides over them. At
Funchal he is called Jui% da Fora; and in the ab-
fence, or after the death of the corregidor, afts as
his deputy. The foreign merchants eledt their own
judges, called the Provudor, who is at the fame time
colleftor of the king’s cuftoms and revenues, which
amount in all to about 12,oool. fterling. Far the
greateft part of this fum is applied towards the fala-
ries of civil and military officers, the pay of troops,
and the maintenance of public buildings. This revenue
a/ifes, fiift from the tenth of all the produce of this

The ifiand has but one company of regular foldiers
of 100 men : the reft of the military force is a militia
confiding of 3000 men, divided into companies, each
commanded by a captain, who has one lieutenant un¬
der him and one enfign. There is no pay given to
either the private men or the officers of this militia 5
and yet their places are much fought after, on account
of the rank which they communica.v. Thefe troops
are embodied once a-year, and exercifed once a-month.
All the military are commanded by the Scrjeantc M6r«
The governor has two Capita nos de Sal about him, who
do dmy as aides de-camp.
The fecular priefts on the ifland are about 1200,
many of whom are employed as private tutors. Since
the expulfion of the Jeluits, no regular public fchool
is to be found here ; unlefs wre except a feminary,
where a prieft, appointed for that purpofe, inftrutts
and educates ten Undents at the king’s expence. Thefe
wear a red cloak over the ufual black gowns worn
by ordinary {Indents. All thoie who intend to go
into orders, are obliged to qualify themfelves by
ftudying in the univerfity of Coimbra, lately re-efta-
bliihed in Portugal. There is alfo a dean and chap¬
ter at Madeira, with a bilhop at their head, whofe
income is confiderably greater than the governor’s 5
it confifts of no pipes of wine, and of 40 muys of
wheat, each containing 24 bufliels j which amounts
in common years to 30C0I. flerling. Here are like¬
wife 60 or 70 Francifcan friars, in four monafteries,
one of which is at Funchal. About 320 nuns live on
the ifland, in four convents, of the order of Merci,
Sta Clara, Incarnacao, and Dom Jefus. Thofe of
the laft mentioned inftitution may marry whenever
they choofe, and leave their monaftery.
In the year 1768, the inhabitants living in the 43
parifties of Madeira, amounted to 63.913, of whom
there were 31,341 males and 32,572 females. But
in that year 5243 perfons died, and no more than
2198 children were born ; fo that the number of the
dead exceeded that of the born by 3045. It is high¬
ly probable that fome epidemical diftemper carried off
fo difproportionate a number in that year, as the
ifland would ftiortly be entirely depopulated if the
mortality were always equal to this. Another cir-
cumftance concurs to ftrengthen this fuppofition, name¬
ly, the excellence of the climate. The weather is in
general mild and temperate : in fummer, the heat is
very moderate on the higher parts of the ifland, whither
the better fort of people retire for that feafon •, and in
the winter the fnow remains there for feveral days,
whilft it is never known to continue above a day or two
in the lower parts.
The common people of this ifland are of a tawny-
colour, and well ffiaped ; though they have large feet,
owing perhaps to the efforts they are obliged to make
in climbing the craggy paths of this mountainous
country. Their faces are oblong, their eyes dark j
their black hair naturally falls in ringlets, and begins to
crifp in fome individuals, which may perhaps be owing
to intermarriages with negroes \ in general, they are
hard featured, but not difagreeable. 'I heir women
are too frequently ill-favoured, and want the florid
complexion, which, when united to a pleafing affem-

Madeifas blage of regular features, gives our northern fair ones
 <v ; the°fuperiority over all their fex. They are fmall,
have prominent cheek bones, large feet, an ungraceful
gait, and the colour of the darkeft brunette. The
jutt proportion of the body, the fine form of their
hands, and their large lively eyes, feem in fome mea-
fure to compenfate for thofe defers. The labour¬
ing men, in fummer, wear linen trowfers, a coarfe
fliirt, a large hat, and boots ; fome have a fhort jacket
made of cloth, and a long cloak, which they fome-
times carry over their arm. The women wear a pet¬
ticoat, and a fhort corfelet or jacket, clofely fitting
their fhapes, which is a fimple, and often not an in¬
elegant, drefs. They have alio a fhort but wide
cloak •, and thofe that are unmarried tie their hair on
the crown of their head, on which they wear no co¬
vering.
The country people are exceeding fober and frugal 5
their diet in general confiding of bread and onions,
or other roots, and little animal food. However,
they avoid eating tripe, or any offals, becauie it is
proverbially faid of a very poor man, “ He is reduced
to eat tripe.” Their common drink is water, or an
infufion of the remaining rind or fkin of the grape
(after it has paffed through the wine prefs), which
when fermented acquires fome tartnefs and acidity, but
cannot be kept very long. The wine for which the
iHand is fo famous, and which their own hands prepare,
feldom if ever regales them.
Their principal occupation is the planting and raif-
ing of vines •, but as that branch of agriculture re¬
quires little attendance during the greateil part of the
year, they naturally incline to idlenefs. 1 he warmth
of the climate, which renders great provifion againd
the inclemencies of weather unneceffary, and the eafe
with which the cravings of appetite are fatisfied, mud
tend to indolence, wherever the regulations of the
legidature do not counteract it, by endeavouring, with
the profpeft of increafing happinefs, to infufe the Ipi-
rit of indudry. It feetns the Portuguefe government
does not purfue the proper methods againd this dan¬
gerous lethargy of the date. They have lately order¬
ed the plantation of olive trees here, on fuch fpots as
are too dry and barren to bear vines •, but they have
not thought of giving temporary adidance to the la¬
bourers, and have offered no premium by which thefe
might be induced to conquer their reludance to inno¬
vations and averfion to labour.
The vineyards are held only on an annual tenure,
and the fanner reaps but four-tenths of the produce,
fmce other four tenths are paid in kind to the owner
of the land, one tenth to the king, and one to the
clergy. Such fmall profits, joined to the thought of
toiling merely for the advantage of others, if improve¬
ments were attempted, entirely preclude the hopes of
a future increafe. Oppreffed as they are, they have
however preferved a high degree of cheer!ulnefs and
contentment ; theif labours are commonly alleviated
with fongs, and in the evening they affemble from
different cottages to dance to the drowfy mufic ol a
guitar.
The inhabitants of the towns are more ill-favoured
than the country people, and often pale and lean.
The men wear French clothes, commonly black, which
do not feem to fit them, and have been in falhion in

the polite world about half a century ago. i treir la- ^
dies are delicate, and have agreeable features : but tne
charafteriftic jealouly of the men Hill locks them up,
and deprives them of a happinels which the country
women, amidft all their diftreffes, enjoy. Many ol tne
better people are a fort of petite noblejje, which we
wmuld cz\\gentry, whole genealogical pride makes them
unfociable and ignorant, and caufes a ridiculous affetla-
tion of gravity. The landed property is in the hands
of a few ancient families, who live at Funchal, and in
the various towns on the ifland.
Madeira confiixs of one large mountain, whofe
branches rife everywhere from the fea towards the
centre of the illand, converging to the fummit, in the
midft of which is a depreffion or excavation, called the
Val by the inhabitants, always covered with a frefii
and delicate herbage. The {tones on the ifland feem to
have been in tbe fire, are full of holes, and or a black-
ifh colour; in Ihort, the greater part of them are lava.
A few of them are of the kind which the Derbyibire
miners call dunjlone. The foil of the whole iliand is
a tarras mixed with fome particles of clay, lime, and
fand, and has much the fame appearance as fome
earths on the ifie of Afcenfion. I'rom this circum-
ftance, and from the excavation of the fummit of the
mountain, it is probable, that in fome remote period
a volcano has produced the lava and the ochreous par¬
ticles, and that the Val w-as formerly its crater.
Many brooks and fmall rivulets defeend from the
fummits in deep chafms or glens, which feparate the
various parts of the ifland. The beds of the brooks are
in fome places covered with {tones of all fizes, carried
down from the higher parts by the violence of winter
rains or floods of melted fnow. ihe water is conduct¬
ed by wears and channels in the vineyards, where each
proprietor has the ufe of it for a certain time 5 fome
being allowed to keep a conftant fupply of it, fome
to ufe it thrice, others twice, and others only once a-
week. As the heat of the climate renders this fupply
of water to the vineyards abfolutely neceffary, it is
not without great expence that a new vineyard can be
planted } ior the maintenance of which, the owners muff
purchafe water at a high price, from thofe who are
conftantly fupplied, and are thus enabled to fpare fome
of it.
Wherever a level piece of ground can be contrived
in the higher hills, the natives make plantations of ed-
does enclofed by a kind of dike to caufe a ftagnation,
as that plant fucceeds beftin fwampy ground. Its leaves
ferve as food for bogs, and the country people ufe the
roots for their own nourithment.
The fweet potato is planted for the fame purpofe,
and makes a principal article of diet \ together with
chefnuts, which grow in extenfive woods, on the higher
parts of the ifland, where the vine will not thrive.
Wheat and barley are likewife fown, efpecially in
fpots where the vines nre decaying through age, or
where they are newly planted. But the crops do not
produce above three months proviflons $ and the in¬
habitants are therefore obliged to have recourie to
other food, befides importing confiderable quantities
of corn from North America in exchange for wine.
The want of manure, and the inaSh uy of the people,
are in fome meafure the caufes of this difadvantage ”,

-• here, they could net raife corn fufficient for their con-
“ fi mption. They make their thrcfhing floors of a cir¬
cular form, in a corner ot a field, which is cleared and
beaten folid for the purpoie. The (heaves arc laid
round about it; and a iquare board, duck full of (harp
llints below, is dragged over them by a pair of oxen,
the driver getting on it to increafe its weight. This
machine cuts the thaw as if it had been chopped, and
trees the grain from the hulk, from which it is after¬
wards feparated.
The great produce of Madeira is the wine, from
which it has acquired fame and fupport. Where the
foil, expofure, and fupply of water, will admit of it,
the vine is cultivated. One or more walks, about a
yard or two wide, interfeft each vineyard, and are
included by Hone walls two feet high. Along thefe
walks, which are arched over with laths about feven
feet high, they ereft wooden pillars at regular di-
llances, to luppoit a lattice-work ot bambocs, which
Hopes down from both lides of the walk, till it is only
a foot and a half or two feet high, in which elevation
it extends over the whole vineyard. The vines are in
this manner fupported from the ground, and the peo¬
ple have rqom to root out the weeds which fpring up
between them. In the feafon of the vintage, they
creep under this lattice-work, cut off the grapes, and
lay them into balkets : feme bunches of theie grapes
weigh fix pounds and upwards. This method of keep¬
ing the ground clean and moift, and ripening the grapes
in the ihade, contributes to give the Madeira wanes
that excellent flavour and body for which they are re¬
markable. The owners of vineyards are however
obliged to allot a certain fpot of ground for the growth
of bamboos ; for the lattice-work cannot be made with¬
out them : and it is faid fome vineyards lie quite ne-
glefted for Tvant of this ufeful reed.
The wines are not all of equal gcodnefs, and con-
fequently of different prices. The beft, made of a
vine imported from Candia by order of the Infante jrf
Portugal, Don Henry, is called Madeira Mahnfeij, a
pipe of which cannot be bought on the fpot for lefs
than 40I. or 42I. (lerling. It is an exceeding rich
fweet wire, and is only made in a fmall quantity. The
next fort is a dry wine, fuch as is exported for the Lon¬
don market, at 30I. or 31k fterling. the pipe. Inferior
forts for the Fail India, Well India, and North Ameri¬
can markets, fell at 28k 25I. and 20k fterling. About
30,000 pifes, upon a mean, are made every year, each
containing 110 gallons. About 13,000 pipes of the
better forts are exported : and all the reft is made into
brandy for the Bra2ils, converted into vinegar, or con-
lamed at home.
The large ft quantity of this article exported in the
courfe of one year, is faid to have amounted to 15.000
pipes, valued at 500,000!. of which 5,500 pipes were
fent to the Eaft Indies, 4,500 to England, 3,000 to
to the Weft Indies, and 2,000 to America.
The enclofures of the vineyards confift of walls, and
hedges of prickly pear, pomegranates, myrtles, bram¬
bles, and wild rofes. The gardens produce peaches,
apricots, quinces, apples, pears, walnuts, chefnuts, ahd
many other European fruits; together with now and
then fome tropical plants, fuch as bananas, goavas, and
fine-apples.
All the common domeftic animals of Europe are
38 ] MAD
likewife found at Madeira; and their mutton and beef,
though fmall, is very well tailed. Their horfes are
fmall, but fure-footed ; and with great agility climb
the difficult paths, which are the only means of com¬
munication in the country. They have no v.’heel-car-
riages of any kind : but in the town they ufe a fort
of drays or fledges, formed of two pieces of plank
joined by crofs pieces, which make an acute angle be¬
fore ; thefe are drawn by oxen, and are ufed to tranf-
port calks of wine, and other heavy goods, to and
from the warehoufes.
The animals of the feathered tribe, which Jive wild
here, are more numerous than the wild quadrupeds ;
there being only the common gray rabbit here, as a
rt prefentative of the laft-mentioned clal’s. Tame birds,
fuch as tuikeys, geei'e, ducks, and hens, are very rare,
which is perhaps owing to the fcarcity of corn.
1 here are no fnakes whatfoever in Madeira ; but
all the houf s, vineyards, and gardens, iwarrn with liz--
ards. The friars of one of the convents complained
to Mr Forller, that thefe vermine deftroyed the fruit
in their garden ; they had therefore placed a brafs-
kettle in the ground to catch them, as they are con-
liantly running about in quell of food. In this man¬
ner they daily caught hundreds, which could not get
out on account of the fmooth lides of the kettle, but
were forced to periih.
The fhores of Madeira, and of the neighbouring
Salvages and Defertas, are not without filh ; but as
they are not in plenty enough for the rigid obfervance
of Lent, pickled herrings are brought fiom Gotten-
burg in Englilh bottoms, and falted cod from New
York and other American ports, to fupply the defici¬
ency.

two ftately bridges here over the Manzanares, a great
many magnificent churches, convents, hofpitals, and
padaces. The royal palace, which ftands on the weft
fide of the town, on an eminence, is fpacious and mag¬
nificent, confifting of three courts, and commanding a
fine profpeft. At the eaft end of the town is the pra-
do, or pardo 5 which is a delightful plain, planted with
regular rows of poplar trees, and watered with a grca>-
many fountainswhere the nobility and genti y take
the air on horfeback, or in their coaches, and the com¬
mon people on foot, or divert themfelves with a variety
of fports and exercifes. Almoft all the ftreets of Ma¬
drid are ftraight, wide, clean, and well paved. The
largeft and moft frequented are the ftreet of Alcala,
that of Atocha, that of Toledo, and the Ca//e Grande
or great ftreet. Madrid has alfo feverat fquares, which
in general are not very regular, d. he principal are
thofe of San Joachim, Sol, Lafganitas, San Domingo,
La Cevado, and the Plaza Mayor. The latter^ efpe-
cially deferves notice for its fpacioufnefs and regularity,
and the elegant and lofty houfes it contains. It is 1 53^
feet in circuit. The houfes, of which there are 136,
are of five ftories, ornamented with balconies; the firft
of which, fupported by pillars, forms a piazza round
the fquare, where the inhabitants may walk under co¬
ver. In the middle of the fquare a market is kept.—
The ftreets and fquares of Madrid, except the Plaza
Mayor which has been juft deferibed, are ornamented
with fountains in a very ill tafte. d nofe moft to oe di-
ft'mguilhed in this particular are the fountain of the
fmall irregular fquare called P/axa di Antonio Martin,
and that of the fquare named Puerto del Sol. I he
others are not more magnificent though lefs ridiculous.
The water of all thefe fountains is excellent } and the
air of Madrid, though the weather be variable and un¬
certain, is extremely pure. It was this purity of the
air and excellent quality of the water which induced
Philip II. and his fucceffors to fix their refidence in this
city. It is alfo well fupplied with provifions of all kinds
at reafonable rates 5 and the court, with the refort and
refidence of the quality, and the high colleges and of¬
fices that are kept here, occafion a brilk. trade and cir¬
culation of money.
The facred edifices in this city have nothing remark¬
able in their architefture } thofe of St Pafqual, St Ifa-
bella, and the Carmelites, contain highly valuable col-
lefilions of piiffures, which may be feen with admiration
even after the paintings of the Efcurial and the new pa¬
lace. The church of St Ifidro, which heretofore be¬
longed to the Jefuits, has a portal which has efcaped
the contagion of the age in which it was built. There
is another church much more modern, which on ac¬
count of its mafs has a venerable appearance, but which
true tafte may juftly difavow : it is that of St Saleias,
or the Vifitation, founded by Ferdinand VI. and the
queen Barbara his wife.—The convent of St Francis
* Bourgo- has already been fome years building *, and there are
anne's hopes that it will become one of the fined produflicns
•vets in arc]iite£lure in the capital.—Beiides a variety of cha-
vitzble foundations, there are here three confraternities,
the revenues of which are appropriated to the fuccour
of the wretched : and an inftitution fimilar to the Mont
de Piete in Paris, the principal objeft of which is to ad
vance money to the neceflitous.
The city of Madrid contains 15 gates, 18 parithes,
35 convents of monks, and 31 of nuns; 39 colleges,
hofpitals, or houfes of charity ; 7398 dwelling-houfes,
and about 160,coo inhabitants. The Lombard tra¬
veller, Father Caimo, tells us, that 50,000 ftieep and
1 2,000 oxen are annually confumed there ; to which
his editor has added a ludicrous eftimate of the onions
and leeks devoured there, which he lays amount to
979000000000000000000000000000045. But this
writer (M. Bourgoanne obferves) would not at pre-
fent have any reafon to complain ol the difagreeable
fmells of the ftreets, nor would he find all the per¬
fumes of Arabia neceffary to defend himfelf from them.
By the vigilance of the modern police, for which (M.
Bourgoanne informs us) it is indebted to the Count
d’Aranda, it is rendered one of the cleaneft cities in
Europe.
There are four academies in Madrid : The firft is
the Spanilh academy, founded in 17I4> invitation of
the French academy, and confifting of 24 members,
including the preiident. Its device is a crucible on
burning coals, with the motto hmfna, Jixa, y da efplen-
der; “ it purifies, fixes, and gives luftre.” Its firft
objedl was the compilation of a di&ionary of the Spa-
nith language, which was published in fix volumes folio,
and of which a new edition, with great additions, has
been lately put to die prefs. The lame academy is
alfo employed on a fuperb edition of Don (ftuixotte,
adorned with elegant engravings far fuperior to the
laft, and collated with ail the former editions. The
fecond is the academy of hiftory ; which owes its ori¬
gin to a fociety of individuals, the objedl of whofe
meetings was to preferve and illuftrate the hiftorical
monuments of the kingdom of Spain. Their labours
met the approbation ol Philip V. who in 1738 con¬
firmed the ftatutes by a royal cedula. This academy

MAECENAS, Caius Cilnius, the great friend and
counfellor of Auguftus Caefar, was himfelf a very polite
fcholar, but is chiefly memorable for having been the
patron and prote&or of men of letters. He was de¬
fended fiom a moft ancient and illuftrious origin, even
from the kings of Hetruria, as Horace often tells us •,
but his immediate forefathers were only of the equef-
trian order. He is fuppofed to have been born at Rome,
becaufe his family lived there ; but in wrhat year, anti¬
quity does not tell us. It fays as little about his educa¬
tion ; but we know it muft have been of the moft libe¬
ral kind, and perfectly agreeable to the dignity and
fplendour of his birth, fince he excelled in every thing
that related to arms, politics, and letters. How Mse-
cenas fpent his younger years is alfo unknown to us,
any farther than by effeCls ; there being no mention
made of him by any writer before the death of Julius
Caefar, which happened in the year of Rome 709.
Then Oftavius Caefar, who was afterwards called Au-
gujlus, w'ent to Rome, to take polTeffion of his uncle’s
inheritance ; and then Maecenas became firft publicly
known, though he appears to have been Auguftus’s in¬
timate friend, and as it fhould feem guardian, from his
childhood. From that time he accompanied him
through all his fortunes, and was his counfellor and
advifer upon all occafions ; fo that Ptedo Albinovanus
jmfiy called him Ca-far is dextram, “ Csefar’s right-
hand.”
In A. R. 710, the year that Cicero was killed and
Ovid born, Maecenas diftinguifhed himfelf by his cou¬
rage and mibtary fkill at the battle of Modena, where
the con fills Hirtius and Panfa were {lain in fighting
againft Antony j as he did afterwards at Philippi.
[ 34° ]
MAE
After this laft battle began the memorable friendxhip
between Maecenas and Horace. Horace, as Suetonius
relates, was a tribune in the army of Brutus and Caf-
fius, and upon the defeat of thofe generals made a pri-
foner of war. Maecenas, finding him an accompliihed
man, became immediately his friend and protector;
and afterwards recommended him to Auguftus, who
reftored to him his eftate with no frnall additions. In
the mean time, though Maecenas behaved himfelf well
as a foidier in thefe and other battles, yet his principal
province was that of a minifter and counfellor. He
was the adviler, the manager, the negociator, in every
thing that related to civil affairs. When the league
was made at Brundufium between Antony and Au¬
guftus, Ma?cenas was fent to act on the part of Au¬
guftus. 1 his we learn from Horace in his journey to
Biundufium:
Hue venturus erat Maecenas optimus, atque
Cocceius, mijji magnis de rebus uterque
Legati, avtrfos fohti componere amicos. Sat. v. lib. 1.
And afterwards, when this league was near breaking,
through the iufpicions of each party, Macaenas was fent
to Antony to ratify it anew.
In the year 717, when Auguftus and Agrippa went
to Sicily to fight Sextus Pompeius by lea, Maecenas
went with them ; but foon after returned, to appeafe
fome commotions which were rifing at Rome : for
though he ufually attended Auguftus in all his military
expeditions, yet whenever there was any thing to be
done at Rome either with the fenate or people, he was
always defpatched thither for that purpofe.
Upon the total defeat of Antony at A&ium, Meece-
nas returned to Rome, to take the government into his
hands, till Auguftus could fettle forne neceffary affairs
in Greece and Afia. Agrippa foon followed Maecenas j
and when Auguftus arrived, he placed thefe two great
men and faithful adherents, the one over his civil, the
other over his military concerns. While Auguftus was
extinguilhing the remains of the civil war in Afia and
Egypt, young Lepidus, the fon of the triumvir, was
forming a fcheme to affaflinate him at his return to
Rome. This confpiracy was difeovered at once, by the
extraordinary vigilance of Maecenas •, who, as Velleius
Paterculus fays, “ obferving the rath councils of the
headftrong youth with the fame tranquillity and calm-
nefs as if nothing at all had been doing, inftantly put
him to death, without the leaft noife and tumult $ and
by that means extinguithed another civil war in its very-
beginning.” '
The civil wmrs being now sat an end, Auguftus re¬
turned to Rome ; and from this time Maecenas indulged
himfelf at vacant hours in literary amufements, and the
converfation of men of letters. In the year 734 Virgil
died, and left Auguftus and Maecenas heirs to what he
had. Maecenas was excefiively fond of this poet, who,
of all the wits of the Auguftan age, flood higheft in his
efteem ) and if the Georgies and the ^Eneid be owing
to the good tafte and encouragement of this patron, as
there is fome reafon to think, pofterity cannot comme-
n !*rate him with too much gratitude. Horace may be
ranked next to Virgil in Maecenas’s good graces : we
have already mentioned how and at what time their
friendlhip commenced. Propertius alfo acknowledges
Maecenas for his favourer and prote£for,it hb. ii. eleg. 7.
Nor

Maecenas. Nor mud Varius be forgot, though we have nothing of
'v ' his remaining •, fince we find him highly praifed by both
Virgil and Horace. He was a writer of tragedies ; and
Quintilian thinks he may be compared with any of the
ancients. In a word, Maecenas’s houfe was a place of
refuge and welcome to all the learned of his time ; not
only to Virgil, Horace, Propertius, and Varius, but to
Fundarius, whom Horace extols as an admirable writer
of comedies : to Fulcus Ariftiys, a noble grammarian,
and Horace’s intimate friend: to Plotius I ucea, who
affifted Varius in correcting the iEneid after the death
of Virgil ; to Valgius, a poet and very learned man,
who, as Pliny tells us, dedicated a book to Auguftus,
De ufu Herbarum ; to Afinius Pollio, an excellent tra¬
gic writer 5 and to feveral others, whom it would be
tedious to mention. All thefe dedicated their works,
01 fome part of them at lealt, to Maecenas, and cele¬
brated his praifes in them over and over : and we may
obferve farther, what Plutarch tells us, that even Au-
gullus himfelf infcribed his Commentaries to him and to
Agrippa.
Maecenas continued in Augutlus’s favour to the end
of his life, but not uninterruptedly. Auguftus had an
intrigue with Maecenas’s wife : and though the minifter
bore this liberty of his mailer very patiently, yet there
was a coldnefs on the part of Auguftus, which, how¬
ever, foon went off. Maecenas died in the year 745 ;
but at wrhat age we cannot precifely determine, though
we know he muft have been old. He mult have been
older than Auguftus, becaufe he was a kind of tutor to
him in his youth : and then find him often called an
old man by Paedo Albinovanus, a cotemporary poet,
whofe elegy upon his dead patron is (till extant. He
made Auguftus his heir ; and recommended his friend
Florace to him in thofe memorable laft words, “ Hora-
tii Flacci, ut mei, memor e/?o,” &c. Horace, how¬
ever, did not probably furvive him long, as there is no
elegy of his upon Maecenas extant, nor any account of
one having ever been written, which there certainly
would have been had Horace furvived him any time.
Nay, Father Sanadon, the French editor of Horace,
will have it, that the poet died before his patron ; and
that thefe laft wmrds were found only in Maecenas’s
will, which had not been altered.
Maecenas is faid never to have enjoyed a good ftate
of health in any part of his life : and many Angularities
are related of his bodily conftitution. Thus Pliny tells
us, that he was always in a fever •, and that, for three
years before his death, he had not a moment’s ileep.
Though he was certainly an extraordinary man, and
poffeffed many admirable virtues and qualities, yet it is
agreed on all hands, that he was very luxurious and ef¬
feminate. “ Maecenas (fays Velleius Paterculus) was
of the equeftrian order, but fprung from a moft illuf-
trious origin. He vvas a man, who, when bufinefs re¬
quired, was able to undergo any fatigue and watching j
who confulted properly upon all occafions, and knew as
well how to execute what he had confulted •, yet a man
who in fea'ons of leifure was luxurious, foft, and effe¬
minate, almoft beyond a woman. He was no lefs dear
to Caefar than Agrippa, but diftinguiftied by him with
fewer honours •, for he always continued of the equef¬
trian rank, in which he was born : not that he could
not have been advanced upon the leaft intimation, but
he never folicited it,” .
But let mcralifts and politicians determine of Muece- Ma'elftrom *
nas as they pleafe, the men of letters are under high v
obligations to celebrate his praifes and revere his memo¬
ry : for he countenanced, protected, and fupported, as
far as they w’anted his fupport, all the wits and learn¬
ed men of his time *, and that, too, out of a pure and
dilinterefted love of letters, when he had no little views
of policy to ferve by their means : whence it is no
wonder, that all the proteflors and patrons of l earning,
ever fince, have ufually been called Maecenas's.
MAELSTROM, a very dangerous whirlpool on
the coaft of Norway, in the 68th degree of latitude, in
the province of Nordland, and the diftrifl of Lofoden,
and near the ifland of Mofkoe, from w'hence it alfo
takes the name of MofkoeJlrom. Its violence and
roarings exceed that of a catarafl, being heard to a
great diftance, and without any intermiftion, except a
quarter every fixth hour, that is, at the turn of high
and low water, when its impetuofity feems at a (land,
wThich fhort interval is the only time the filhermen can
venture in ; but this motion foon returns, and, however
calm the fea tpiay be, gradually increafes with fuch a
draught and vortex, as abforb whatever comes within
their Iphere of aclion, and keep it under water for
fome hours, when the fragments, ftfivered by the
rocks, appear again. This circumftance, among o~
thers, makes ftrongly againft Kircher and others, who
imagine that there is here an abyfs penetrating the
globe, and iffuing in fome very remote parts, which
Kircher is fo particular as to aftign, for he names the
gulf of Bothnia. But after the moft exadl refearches
which the circumftances will admit, this is but a con-
jeffure without foundation •, for this and three other
vortices among the Ferroe iflands, but fmaller, have
no other caufe than the collifion of w7aves ri'.lng and
falling, at the flux and reflux, againft a ridge of rocks
and (helves, which confine the water fo that it precipi¬
tates itfelf like a catarafl ; and thus the higher the
flood rifes, the deeper muft the fall be ; and the na¬
tural refult of this is a whirlpool or vortex, the pro¬
digious fuilion whereof is fufficiently known by leffer
experiments. But what has been thus abforbed, re¬
mains no longer at the bottom than the ebb lafts ; for
the Tuition then ceafes, and the flood removes all at¬
traction, and permits whatever had been funk to make
its appearance again. Of the fituation of this amazing
Molkoe-ftrom we have the following account from Mr
Jonas Ramus : “ The mountain of Helfeggen, in Lo¬
foden, lies a league from the ifland Ver, and betwixt
thefe two runs that large and dreadful ftream called
MoJkoe-Jlrom, from the ifland Molkoe, which is in the
middle of it, together with feveral circumjacent illes,
as Ambaaren, half a quarter of a league northward,
Iflefen, Hoeholm, Kieldholm, Suarven, and Back-
holm. Mofkoe lies about half a quarter of a mile
fouth of the ifland of Ver, and betwixt them thefe
fmall iflands, Otterholm, Fiimen, Sanflefen, Stock¬
holm. Betwixt Lofoden and Molkoe, the depth of
the water is between 36 and 40 fathoms ; but on the
other fide, towards Ver, the depth derreafes, fo as not
to afford a convenient paffage for a vt-ffel, without the
rilk of fplitting on the recks, which ha. pens even in
the calraeft wTeather : when it is flood, the ftream runs
up the country between Lofoden and Molkoe with a
boifterous rapidity : but the roar of. its impetuous ebb

inevitably abforbed and carried down to the bottom,
and there beat to pieces againfl the rocks ; and when
the water relaxes, the fragments thereof are thrown up
again. But thefe intervals of tranquillity are only at
the turn of the ebb and flood, and calm weather ; and
lafl: but a quarter of an hour, its violence gradually re¬
turning. When the ftream is moft boifterous, and its
fury heightened by a ftorm, it is dangerous to come
within a Norway mile of it : boats, ihips, and yachts
having been carried away, by not guarding againft it
before they were within its reach. It likewile happens
frequently, that whales come too near the ftream, and
are overpowered by its violence ; and then it is impof-
fible to defcribe their bowlings and bellowings in their
fruitlefs if niggles to difengage themfelves. A bear
once attempting to fwim from Lofoden to Moikoe,
with a deiign of preying upon the iheep at paflure in
the ifiand, afforded the like fpeftacle to the people •,
the ftream caught him, and bore him down, whilft he
roared terribly, fo as to be heard on fhore. Large
flocks of firs and pine trees, after being abforbed by
the current, rife again, broken and torn to inch a de¬
gree as if briftles grew on them. This plainly {hows
the bottom to confift of craggy rocks, among which
they are whirled to and fro. This ftream is regulated
by the flux and reflux of the fea •, it being conftantly
high and low water every fix hours. In the year 1645,
early in the morning of Sexagefima Sunday, it raged
with fuch noife and impetuofity, that on the illand
.of Mofkoe, the very if ones of the houfes fell to the
ground.”

MAESTRICHT, an ancient, large, and flrong
town of the Netherlands, ceded to the Dutch by the
treaty of Munfter. The townhoufe and the other
public buildings are bandfome, and the place is about
four miles in circumference, and ftrongly fortified. It
is governed jointly by the Dutch and the bithop of
Liege.; however, it has a Dutch garrifon. The in¬
habitants are noted for making excellent fire arms, and
fome fay that in the arfenal there are arms fufficient
for a whole army. Both Pauifts and Proteftants aie
allowed the free exercife of their religion, and the ma-
glftrates are compoled of both. It is feated on the
river Maefe, which feparates it from Wyck, and with
which it communicates by a bandfome bridge. Mae-
ftricht revolted from the Spaniards in but was
reduced in 1579. Lotus XiV. became mafter of it

which he called The thirteenth bock of the JEneid: this
was as humoroufly tranflated into Englifh a few years fince

by his love of learning, which made him undertake fe¬
veral voyages into France, England, and Germany.
He converfed with the learned in all thofe countries,
and obtained their friendftiip and efteem. He was a
member of the academy of the Arcadia at Rome, an
honorary foreign member of that of Infcriptions at
Paris; and died in 1755. He wrote many works in

inftrument, formed of 20 chords arranged in pairs,
and tuned to unifon or octave, fo that they yielded
ten founds 5 the invention rvhereof is alcribed by fome
to Sappho •, by others, to the Lydians; and by fome,
to Timotheus of Miletus. The other was a kind of
flute, which at the fame time yielded very high and
very low notes. The former kind was at lead; much
improved by Timotheus of Miletus, who is faid to
have been impeached of a crime, becaufe by increafing
the number of chords he fpoiied and diicredited the
ancient mufic.
MAGAZINE, a place in which (lores are kept,
of arms, ammunition, proviflons, &c. Every forti¬
fied town ought to be furnilhed with a large maga¬
zine, which fhould contain (lores of ail kinds, fuffi-
cient to enable the garrifon and inhabitants to hold
out a long fiege ; and in which (miths, carpenters,
wheelwrights, &c. may be employed in making every
thing belonging to the artillery 5 as carriages, wag¬
gons, &c.
Powder Magazine, is that place where the powder
is kept in very large quantities. Authors differ greatly
both with regard to their fituation and cohflrudlion ;
but ail agree that they ought to be arched and bomb¬
proof. In fortifications, they are frequently placed in
the rampart ; but of late they have been built in differ¬
ent parts of the town. The firlt powder magazines
tvere made with Gothic arches : but M. Vauban find¬
ing them too weak, conftrufled them in a femicircular
form; vvhofe dirnenfionsare 60 feet long within, and 25
broad ; the foundations are eight or nine feet thick, and
eight Tet high from the foundation to the fp ing of the
arch ; rhe floor is two feet from the ground, v/hich
keeps it from dampnefs.
One of our engineers of great experience fome time
fince had obfei ved, that after the centres of femicircu¬
lar arches are ftruck, they fettle at thee rown and rife
up at the hunches, even with a (Iraight horizontal ex- Magazine,
trades, and dill much more fo in powder magazines,
whole outfide at top is formed like the roof of a houfe,
by two inclined planes joining in an angle over the top
of the arch, to give a proper defeent to the rain; which
effects are exactly what might be expected agreeable
to the true theory of arches. Now, as this (hrinking
of the arches mult be attended with very ill confequen-
ces, by breaking the texture of the cement after it has
been in (ome degree dried, and alfo by opening the
joints of the voufl'oirs at one end, fo a remedy is pro¬
vided for this inconvenience with regard to bridges,
by the arch of equilibration in Mr Hutton’s book on
bridges ; but as the ill eff'edl is much greater in powder
magazines, the fame ingenious gentleman propofed to
find an arch of equilibration (or them alio, and to con-
ftx’udl it when the fpan is 20 feet, the pitch or height
10 (which are the fame dimenli ms as the femicircie),
the inclined exterior walls at top forming an angle of
113 degrees, and the height of their angular point a-
bove the top of the arch equal to feven feet. This very
curious quefiion was anfwered in 1775 by the reverend
Mr Wildbore, to be found in Mr Hutton’s Mifcellanea
Mathemaiica.
Artillery Magazine. In a liege, the magazine is
made about 25 or 30 yards behind the battery, towards
the parallels, and at leail three feet under ground, to
hold the powder, loaded (hells, portfires, &c. Its (ides
and roof mull be well fecured with boards to prevent
the earth from falling in : a door is made to it, and a
double trench or paffage is funk from the magazine to
the battery, one to go in and the other to come out at,
to prevent confulion. Sometimes traveries are made in
the paflages to prevent ricochet (hot from plunging into
them.

was The Gentleman's, let on foot by the projector Mr
Edward Cave in the year 1731 : (fee the article Cave).
This, as Dr Kippis obferves *, “ may be confidered as *Biog.Briti
lomething of an epocha in the literary hiltory of this A-rt*
country. The periodical performances before that time ^AVE-
were almoft wholly confined to political traniaclions,
and to foreign and domeflic occurrences ; but the
monthly magazines have opened a wav . for every kind
of inquiry and information. The intelligence and dif-
cuffion contained in them are very extenfive and va¬
rious : and they have been the means of diffufing a ge¬
neral habit of reading through the nation, which in a
certain degree hath enlarged the public underitanding.
Many young authors, who have afterwards rifen to con-
fiderable eminence in the literary world, have here
made their firll attempts in compofition. Here too are
preferved a multitude of curious and ufeful hints, obfer- ~
vations, and tafts, which othervvife might have never
appeared ; or it they had appeared in a more evanefeent
form, would have incurred the danger of being loll. If

Magdalen, it were not an invidious talk, the hiftory of them would weft by
be no incurious or unentertaining fubjedf. The maga¬
zines that unite utility with entertainment, are undoubt¬
edly preferable to thofe [if there have been any fuch')
which have only a view to idle and frivolous amufe-
tnent. It may be obferved, that two of them, The
Gentteman's and The London, which laft was begun the
year after the former, have amidft their numerous rivals
preferved their reputation to the prefent day. They
have both of them, in general, joined inftruftion with
pleafure; and this likewife hath been the cafe with
fome others of a latter origin.”—The original London
Magazine, it is believed, has been difcontinued for
fome years paft.—The next oldelt publication of this
kind is that entitled The Scots Magazine; which was
commenced at Edinburgh a few years poilerior to the
appearance of the Gentleman's at London ; which, like
it, has furvived many rivals ; and which Hill fubfifts,
defervedly efteemed for the chaltenefs of its plan and
the accuracy of its information.

Religions of St Magdalen, a denomination given to
divers communities of nuns, conlifting generally of pe¬
nitent courtezans *, fometimes alfo called Magdalenettes.
Such are thofe at Metz, eftablifhed in 1452 ; thofe at
Paris, in 1492; thofe at Naples, firft eftablilhed in
1324, and endowed by Queen Sancha, to ferve as a
retreat for public courtezans, who fhould betake them-
felves to repentance •, and thofe of Rouen and Bour-
deaux, which had their original among thofe of Paris in
1618. In each of thefe monalteries there are three
kinds of perfons and congregations \ the firft confift of
thofe w7ho are admitted to make vows, and thefe bear
the name of St Magdalen ; the congregation of St Mar¬
tha is the fecond, and is compofed of thofe whom it is
not judged proper to admit to vows; finally, the con¬
gregation of St Lazarus is compofed of luch as are de¬
tained there by force'.
The religious of St Magdalen at Rome were eftablifh-
ed by Pope Leo X. Clement VIII. fettled a revenue
on them and farther appointed, that the eftefts of all
public proftitutes, dying inteftate, ihould fall to them 5
and that the teftaments of the reft (hould be invalid
unlefs they bequeathed a portion of their effedls, which
was to be at leaft a fifth part, to them.

the principality of Anhalt and Halberftadt, Magde-
on the eaft by Upper Saxony with part of Branden- i burg-
burg, and on the weft by the duchy of Wolfenbuttle.
The Saale circle, and that of Luxkenwalde, are fepa-
rated from the reft, and furrounded on all fides by a
part of Upper Saxony. This country is for the moft
part level; but fandy, marihy, or overgrown with
woods. There are fait fprings in it fo rich, that
they are fufficient to fupply all Germany with that
commodity. The Holz circle is the moft fruitful
part of it. In the Saale circle, where wood is fcarce,
there is pit-coal: and at Rothenburg is a copper-mine
worked. The duchy is well watered, for the Elbe
pafles through it •, and the Saale, Havel, After, Ohre,
and Elfter, either rife in, or wafti fome part of it in
their eourle. The w7hole duchy, exclufive of that part
of the county of Mansfeldt which is connefted with it,
is faid to contain 29 cities, fix towns, about 430 vil¬
lages, and 330,000 inhabitants. The ftates of the
country confift of the clergy, .the nobility, and de¬
puties of the cities. Before it became fubjedf to the
electoral houfe of Brandenburgh, frequent diets were
held in it j but at prefent no diets are held, nor
have the ftates the direftion of the finances as for¬
merly. Before the Reformation, it was an arch-
biftiopric, fubjeft in fpirituals to the pope alone, and
its prelate was primate of all Germany •, but embracing
the Reformation, it chofe itfelf adminiftrators, till the
treaty of Munfter in 1648, when it was given, toge¬
ther with the bilhopric of Halberftadt, to the eledlor
of Brandenburgh, as an equivalent for the Hither Po¬
merania, granted by that treaty to the king of Sweden.
Lutheranifm is the predominant religion here } but Cal-
vinifts, Jews, and Roman Catholics, are tolerated. Of
the laft there are five convents, who never embraced
the Reformation. Aft the Lutheran pariihes, amount¬
ing to 314, are fubjedt to 16 infpeftors, under one ge¬
neral fuperintendant; only the clergy of the old town
of Magdeburg are under the dire&ion of their fenior.
The Jews have a fynagogue at Halle. The manufac¬
tures of the duchy are cloth, Hull's, ftockings, linen, oil-
Ikins, leather, and parchment 5 of which, and grain
of aft forts, large quantities are exported. 1 he arms
of it are, Party per pale, ruby, and pearl. I he king
of Pruffia, as duke of Magdeburg, fits and votes be¬
tween the eleilor of Bavaria, as duke of Bavaria, and
the eleftor palatine, as palfgrave of Lautern. Of the
ftates of the circle of Lower Saxony he is the firft. His
matricular affeffment for the duchy is 43 horfe and 196
foot, or 1300 florins monthly, and to the chamber of
Wetzlar 343 florins and 40 kruitzers. lor the civil
government of the duchy there is a council of regency,
with a war and demefne chamber •, and for the eccle-
fiaftical a\'onfiftory and general fuperintendant. The
revenues of the duchy, arifing from the falt-wOrks, de¬
mefne, and taxes, fome of which are very heavy and
oppreflive, are faid to amount to 80c,000 rixdollars
annually. With refpeft to fait, every houfekeeper in
the Pruflian dominion is obliged to buy a certain
quantity for himfelf and wife •, and alfo for every child
and fervant, horfe, cow, calf, and (beep, that be pof-

of all Lower Saxony, and formerly even of all Germany.
It ftands on the Elbe, in E. Long. 12. 9. N. Lat.
' 52. 16. It is a city of great trade, ftrongly fortified,
and very ancient. Its name fignifies the maiden city;
which, fome imagine, took itsdfe from the temple of
Venus, which is faid to have flood here anciently, and
to have been deftroyed by Charlemagne. The founder
of the city is fuppofed to have been Otho I. or his em-
prefs Editha, daughter to Edmund the Saxon kmg. of
England. The fame emperor founded a Benedicfine
convent here, which he afterwards converted into an
archbifhopric, of which the archbifhop was a count-
palatine, and had very great privileges, particularly that
of wearing the archiepifcopal pallium, and having the
erofs borne before him, befides many others. I he firft
tournament in Germany is faid to have been appointed
near this city, by the emperor Henry the Fowler-, but
thefe paftimes were afterwards abolifhed, becaufe they
eccafioned fuch envy and animofity among the nobi¬
lity, that feveral of them killed one another upon the
Ipot. The fituation of the city is very convenient and
pleafant, upon the banks of the Elbe, amid ft fpacious
fruitful plains, and on the road betwixt High and
Low Germany. It has been a great fufferer by fires
and fleges 5 but by none fo much as that in 1631
when the emperor’s general, Count Tilly, took it by
ftorm, plundered and fet it on fire, by which it was
entirely reduced to afhes, except the cathedral, the
convent of our Lady, and a few cottages belonging
to fifhermen j of 40,000 burghers, not above 400
efcaping. The foldiers fpared neither age nor fex ;
but ripped up w-omen with child, murdered fucking
"infants in fight of their parents, and ravifhed young
women in the ftreets -, to prevent which violation,
many of them flung themfelves into the Elbe, and
others into the fire. The city is now populous, large,
and well built, particularly the broad ftreet and ca¬
thedral fquare. The principal buildings are the. king’s
palace, the governor’s houfe, the armoury, guildhall,
and cathedral. The laft is a fuperb ftru&ure in the
antique tafte, dedicated to St Maurice, which has a
fine organ, the mafter pipe of which is fo big, that a
man can fcarce clafp it with both arms; it alfo con¬
tains the tombs of the emperor Otho and the emprefs
Editha-, a fine marble flatue of St Maurice, a por¬
phyry font, an altar in the choir of one ftone of di¬
vers colours, curioufly wrought, and many other cu-
xiofities. They fhow here a bedftead and table which
belonged to Martin Luther, when he was an Auguf-
tine friar in a cloifter of this city before the Refor¬
mation. Among the relics, they pretended to have
the bafon in which Pilate wafhed his hands after his
condemnation of our Saviour -, the lantern w-hich Judas
made ufe of when he apprehended him } and the lad¬
der on which the cock crowed after St Pei.er denied
him. The chapter confifts of a provoft, fixteen major
and feven minor canons -, befides which, there are four
other Lutheran .collegiate foundations, and a Lutheran
convent dedicated to our Lady, in which is a fchool
or feminary. Here is alfo a gymnafiurn, with an aca¬
demy, in which young gentlemen are inflrudfed in
the art of war. The canons of the chapter, which,
except the change of religion, is upon the fame footing
as before the Roformation, muft make proof of their
nobility. The prebends and dignities are all in the

computed at 1 2,600 crowns a-year. Here is a great an-,
trade, and a variety of manufactures. The chief are
thofe of woollen cloths and fluffs, filks, cottons, linen,
ftockings, hats, gloves, tobacco and fnuff. The city
was formerly one of the Hanfe and Imperial towns.
Editha, confort to Otho I. on whom it was conferred
as a dowry, among many other privileges and advan¬
tages, procured it the grant of a yearly fair. The bur-
gravate of this city was anciently an office of great
power j having the civil and criminal jurifdiCtion, the
office of hereditary cupbearer being annexed to it ; and
was long held as a fief of the archbiftiopric, but after¬
wards became an imperial fief, which was again con¬
ferred on the archbiihopric by the ele&or of Saxony,
upon certain conditions. f

MAGELLAN, Ferdinand ok, an eminent na¬
vigator, was by birth a Portuguefe, of a good family.
He ferved in the Eaft Indies with reputation for five
years under Albuquerque, and in 1510 he greatly di-
ftinguifhed himlelf at the battle of Malacca. Deeming
his fervices poorly repaid by his own court, he entered
into the employment of Charles \ . king of Spain. He
has been charged with peculation by fome of his coun¬
trymen, who have afligned this as the reafon why he
quitted Portugal. In conjunftion with Ruy Folero he
formed the bold defign of difcovexing a new paffage by
the weft to the Molucca iflands, which he offered to
prove fell within the divifion of the globe afligned by
the pope to the crown of Caftile. It is faid that he
firft propofed this enter prize to Emanuel king of Per-
tugal, who rejedled it, as opening a way for other na¬
tions to have accefs to the Eaft Indies, the trade -of
which was now monopolized by the Portuguefe. The
propofition was agreed to by the king of Spam, and on
the 20th of September 1519 Magellan failed from San
Lucar with five ftiips and 236 men under his command.
His officers foon murmured at this appointment, confi-
dering it as a difgrace to be commanded by a rene¬
gade Portuguefe; and when the fleet was lying at a
port in South America which they named San Julian,
a confpiracy was formed againft him by three of the
captains, which he difeovered and quelled. He caufed
the captain of one of the fliips to be affaflinated, he
boarded a fecond, and fecured the mutineers, and the
third fubmitted.
The coaft on which they lay was that of Patagonia ;
and this firft voyage contains accounts of the extraordi¬
nary ftature of the natives. About the end of Odlober
they reached a cape, to which they gave the name of
Dee las Virgines^ forming the entrance of the ftraits
which bear the name of Magellan. He exerted all his
authority to induce his men to venture on this unknown
paffage, with the view of crofting a vaft ocean beyond
it, at the hazard of running ftiort of provifions, of which
a fupply for three months was all he had remaining.
One of his fhips abandoned him, and made the beft of
her way to Europe. The reft proceeded, and on the

Magellan of November they difcovered tlie South fea,
which made Magellan Ihed tears of joy. They conti¬
nued their voyage over this ocean, now viftted for the
firft time by Europeans, and were not long in fuffering
thofe evils from famine which they had apprehended.
The men were reduced to the neceflity of eating the
hides with which the rigging was covered. The
weather proved fo uniformly calm and temperate, that
they gave to the ocean the name of Pacific. They
came in fight of the Ladrones on the 6th of March, fo
called from the thieviih difpofition of the inhabitants j
and from thence they failed to the Philippines. At
Zebu Magellan obtained with little difficulty the con-
verfion of the king j and on condition of his becoming
a vaffal of Spain, the Portuguefe affifted him in re¬
ducing fome neighbouring chieftains, and the crofs was
erefted over fome burnt villages.
With about 50 men Magellan landed upon Matan,
whofe chief refufed to fubmit to Zebu, and an engage¬
ment between them lafted for the greater part of the
day. His troops having Ipent all their ammunition,
found it necefiary to retreat, during which Magellan
rvas wounded in the leg by an arrow, beaten down, and
at laft flain with a lance. This happened in 1521.
By this a£t of imprudence he loft the honour of being
the firft circumnavigator of the globe, which fell to the
lot of Cano, who brought his ffiip home by the Eaft In¬
dies. Yet Magellan has fecured an immortal name
among maritime difcoverers, by the commencement of
this great enterprize, in which he difplayed extraordi¬
nary fkill and refolution, but difregarded juftice and
humanity, then almoft univerfal among adventurers of
this clafs.
Straits of Magellan, a narrow paffage between the
ifland of Terra del Fuego and the fouthern extremity
of the continent of America. This paffage was firft
difcovered by Ferdinand Magellan, who failed through
it into the South fea, and from thence to the Eaft Indies.
Other navigators have paffed the fame way •, but as
thefe ftraits are exceedingly difficult, and fubjeift to
florms, it has been common to fail by Cape Horn,
rather than through the ftraits of Magellan. See Straits
Le Mairk, and Terra del Fuego.

himfelf fo much in this laft ftudy, that the Venetians
fent him into the ifland of Cyprus in quality of judge
of the admiralty. When the Turks beiieged Fama-
gufta, he performed all the fervices that could be ex¬
pelled from the moft excellent engineer : he invented
mines and machines for throwing fire, by means of
which he deftroyed all the works of the befiegers, and
in an inftant overthrew what had coft the Turks infi-
346 1 MAG
nite labour. But they had their revenge •, for, taking
the city in 1571, they plundered his library, carried
him loaded with chains to Conftantinople, and treated '
him in the moft inhuman and barbarous manner. He
neverthelefs comforted himfelf from the example of
iEfop, Menippus, Epiftetus, and other learned men ;
and, after palling the whole day in the meaneft drud¬
gery, he fpent the night in writing. He compofed,
by the help of his memory alone, treatifes filled with
quotations, which he dedicated to the Imperial and
French ambaffadors. Thefe minifters, moved by com-
paffion for this learned man, refolved to purchafe him }
but while they were treating for his ranfom, Maggi
found means to make his elcape, and to get to the
Imperial ambaffador’s houfe j when the grand vifir be¬
ing enraged at his flight, and remembering the great
milchief he had done the Turks during the fiege of
Famagufta, fent to have him feized, and caufed him
to be ftrangled in prifon in 1572. His principal works
are, 1. A Treatife on the Bells of the Ancients. 2. On
the Deftrudlion of the World by Fire. 3. Commen¬
taries on ./Emilius Probus’s Lives of Illuftrious Men.
4. Commentaries on the Inftitutes Thefe works are
.written in elegant Latin. Fie alfo wrote a treatife on
fortification in Italian j and a book on the fituation of
ancient Tufcany.
He ought not to be confounded with his brother
Bartholomew} Maggi, a phyfician at Bologna, who
wrote a treatife of gunffiot wounds : nor with Vincent
Maggt, a native of Breffe, and a celebrated profeffor of
humanity at Ferrara in Padua, who was the author of
feveral works.
MAGGOT, the common name of the fly-worm
bred in fleffi, from the egg of the great blue fleffi fly.
Notwithftanding the diftafte for this animal, its figure
and ftru£ture of parts are greatly worth attending to $
and may ferve as a general hiftory of the clafs of worms
produced from the eggs of flies.
This animal is white and rielhy •, its body is compofed
of a number of rings, like the bodies of caterpillars and
other fimilar infe£ls ; and is Capable, at the pleafure of
the animal, of affuming different figures •, being at times
more or lefs extended in length, and confequently more
or lefs thick.
Notwithftanding that this animal has no legs, it is
able to move itfelf very fwiftly ; and in its firft attempt
to move its body, is extended to its greateft length,
and affumes fomething of the figure of a pointed cone.
The pointed part of the cone is the head of the ani¬
mal, and is not feparated from the next ring by any
deeper furrow than the reft of the rings are from one
another. In fome ftates of the animal, one may fee
two ffiort horns thruft out from the head ; but more
generally two fcaly hooks are obfervable : thefe are,
however, fometimes hid, and have each of them a cafe
or ffieath j into which the animal can retraft them at
pleafure. Thefe hooks are bent into an arch, the con¬
cavity of which is towards the plane on which the crea¬
ture is placed j and they are th ckeft at their infertion
in the head, and thence diminiffi gradually, till they
terminate in a fine ffiarp point.
Thefe two hooks are placed in a parallel direflion,
and can never come together, and therefore cannot
ferve in the place of teeth for grinding the food *, but
merely to pull and fever it in pieces, that it may be of
a
Mag-gi,
Maggot.
MAG [ 347 ] M A G
a proper fize for the mouth of the creature* Befides
thefe hooks the maggot has a kind of aart, which is
about a third part of their length, and is_ placed at an
equal diilance between them. This alfo is brown and
fcaly like them ; it is quite ftraight, and terminates in
a fine point. The hooks have as it were two fcaly
thorns at their points; and this dart feems intended,
by reiterated llrokes to divide, and break the pieces
of delh thefe have feparated from the reft into fmaller
parts. Immediately below7 the apertures for the egrefs
of the hooks, is placed the mouth of the animal ; the
creature does not fhow7 this little opening unlefs pref-
fed : but if the preffure is properly managed it will
fufficiently open it, and there may be difcovered with¬
in it a fmall protuberance, which may very naturally
be fuppofed either the tongue or the fucker of the ani¬
mal. The hooks in thefe creatures not only fupply
the place of teeth, but alio of legs j fince it is by faft-
ening thefe hooks into the fubftance it is placed on,
and then drawing up its body to it, that it pulls itfelf
along.
The back of this creature low7ers itfelf by degrees as
it approaches the extremity of the belly; and near the
place where the back begins to lower itfelf, are placed
the creature’s two principal organs of refpiration. One
may perceive there are two fmall roundiih brown fpots:
they are very eafily diftinguifhable by the naked eye,
becaufe the reft of the body of the creature is w'hite ;
but if we take in the afiiftance cif glafles, each of thefe
fpots appears to be a browm circular eminence raifed
a little above the reft of the body. On each of thefe
fpots one may alio difcover three oblong oval cavities,
fomething of the iliape of button holes; thefe are fitu-
ated in a parallel direftion to one another, and their
length nearly in a perpendicular diredtion to that of
the body of the animal. Thefe apertures are fo many
liigmata or air-holes ; openings deftined to admit the
air necefiary to the life of the animal. It has fix of
thefe ftigmata, three in each fide of its body.
The great tranfparency of the body of this animal
gives us an opportunity alfo to diftinguiftr that it has
on each fide a large white veffel running the whole
length of the body. It is eafy to follow7 the courfe of
thefe veffels through their whole length, but they are
moft diftincl of all towards its hinder part; and they
are always feen to terminate each in the brown fpot
above mentioned ; this leaves us no room to doubt that
they are the twro principal tracheae.
The ramifications of the two great tracheae are very
beautifully feen in this creature, efpecialiy on its belly ;
and it is remarkable, that no veffel analogous to the
great artery in the caterpillar clafs can be difcover¬
ed in thefe ; though, if there were any fuch, their great
tranfparence muft needs make them very eafily diftin-
guifiiable ; nor could its dilatations and contradlions,
if fo confiderable as in that clafs of animals, be lefs fo.
See Caterpillar, Entomoi.ogy Index.
Malpighi imagined, that this artery in the caterpil¬
lar clafs w’as a feries of hearts; in its place, however,
there may be feen in thefe animals a true heart. It is
eafy to obferve in thefe creatures, about the fourth
ring of their body, a fmail flefhy part, w7hich has al¬
ternate contractions and dilatations; and is not only
difcoverable in the body by means of its tranfparence,
but on making a proper fe&ion of them in the fecond,
third, and fourth, will be thrown out of the body of Majjh
the creature, and continue its beats for fome time af-;
tenvards.
MAGI, or Magians, an ancient religious feel in
Perfia, and other eaftern countries, who maintained
that there were two principles, one the caufe of all
good, the other the caufe of all evil: and, abominating
the adoration of images, they worftfipped God only by-
fire ; which they looked upon as the brighteft and moll
glorious fymbol of Oromafdes, or the good god; as
darknefs is the trueft fymbol of Arimanius, or the evil
god. This religion was reformed by Zoroafter, w7ho
maintained that there wras one fupreme independent
Being; and under him two principles or angels, one
the angel of goodnefs and light, and the other of evil
and darknefs; that there is a perpetual ftruggle be¬
tween them, which (hall laft to the end of the world ;
that then the angel of darknefs and his dilciples flrall
go into a wrorld of their own, where they lhall be pu-
nifiied in cverlafting darknefs ; and the angel of light
and his difciples fiiall alfo go into a world ©t their own,
rvhere they fhallbe rewarded in everlafting light.
The priefts of the magi wrere the moil fkilful ma¬
thematicians and philofophers of the ages in which
they lived, infomuch that a learned man and a magian
became equivalent terms. The vulgar looked on their
knowdedge as fupernatural; and hence thofe who prac-
tifed wicked and milchievous arts, taking upon them-
felves the name of magians, drew on it that ill fig-
nification which the word magician now bears among
us.
This fed ftill fubfifts in Perfia under the denomina¬
tion of gaursy where they watch the facred fire with
the greateft care, and never luffer it to be extinguilh-
ed.
MAGIC, (Magia, Mxyux), in its ancient fenfe,
the fcience or difeiphne and dodftrine of the magi, or
wife men of Perfia. See Magi.
The origin of magic and the magi is aferibed to
Zoroafter. Salmafius derives the very name from Zo¬
roafter, who, he lays, was furnamed Mog, whence
Magus. Others, inftead of making him the author of
the Perfian ‘philofophy, make him only the reftorer
and improver thereof; alleging, that many of the Per¬
fian rites in ufe among the magi were borrowed from
the Zabii among the Chaldeans, who agreed in many
things with the magi of the Perfians ; whence fome
make the name magus common both to the Chaldeans
and Perfians. Thus Plutarch mentions, that Zoroafter
inftituted magi among the Chaldeans, in imitation
whereof the Perfians had theirs too.
Magic, in a more modern fenfe, is a fcience which
teaches to perform wonderful and furprifing effeds.
The word magic originally carried with it a very-
innocent, nay, laudable meaning ; being ufed purely
to fignify the ftudy of wifdom, and the more fublime
parts of knowledge; but in regard the ancient magi
engaged themfelves in aftrology, divination, forcery,
&c. the term magic in time became odious, and was
only ufed to fignify an unlawful and diabolical kind of
fcience, depending on the affiftance of the devil and
departed fouls.
If any wonder how fo vain and deceitful a fcience
ftiould gain fo much credit and authority over men’s
minds, Pliny gives the reafon of it. It is, fays he,
X x 2 becaufe
MAG [3
Magic, becaufe it has polTeffed itfelf of three fciences of the
t”rr~”v moft eftcem among men : taking from each all that
is great and marvellous in it. Nobody doubts but it
had its firft origin in medicine ; and that it infmuated
itfelf into the minds of the people, under pretence of
affording extraordinary remedies. To thefe fine pro-
mifes it added every thing in religion that is pompous
and fplendid, and that appears calculated to blind and
captivate mankind. Laftly, It mingled judicial allro-
logy with the reft ; perfuading people, curious of fu¬
turity, that it faw every thing to come in the heavens.
Agrippa divides magic into three kinds j natural, ce-
leftial, and ceremonial or fuperftitious.
Natural Magic is no more than the application of
natural aftive caufes to paftive fubjefts j by means
whereof many furprifing, but yet natural, effefts are
produced.
In this way many of our experiments in natural
philofophy, efpecially thofe of eleddricity, optics, and
magnetifim, have a kind of magical appearance, and
r.rnong the ignorant and credulous might eafily pafs
for miracles. Such, without doubt, have been fome
of thofe miracles wrought by ancient magicians, whofe
knowledge of the various powers of nature, there is
reafon to believe, was much greater than modern va-
f See Stil- nity will fometimes allow f.
Imgfiepfs Baptifta Porta has a treatife of natural magic, or of
^ncr^5 ^ecrets f°r performing very extraordinary things by na-
hook ii. tural caufes. The natural magic of the Chaldeans
c. 2. was nothing but the knowledge of the powders of
fimples and minerals. The magic which they called
theurgia, confifted wholly in the knowledge of the ce¬
remonies to be obferved in the worfhip of the gods, in
order to be acceptable. By virtue of thefe ceremonies
they believed they could converfe wdth fpiritual beings,
and cure difeafes.
Celejhal Magic borders nearly on judiciary aftrolo-
gy : it attributes to fpirits a kind of rule or dominion
over the planets, and to planets a dominion over men ;
and on thofe principles builds a ridiculous kind of fy-
flem. See Astrology.
Superjhtious or Gaelic Magic confifts in the invoca¬
tion of devils. Its effects are ufually evil and wicked,
though very ftrange, and feemingly furpafling the
powers of nature } fuppofed to be produced by virtue
of fome compaft, either tacit or exprefs, with evil fpi¬
rits : but the truth is, thefe have not all the power that
is. ufually imagined, nor do they produce thofe effedts
ordinarily afcribed to them.
, This fpecies of magic, there is every reafon to be¬
lieve, had its origin in Egypt, the native country of
paganifm. The firft magicians mentioned in hiftory
were Egyptians; and that people fo famed for early
wnfdom believed not only in the exiftence of daemons,
the great agents in magic (fee DiEMON), but alfo that
different orders of thofe fpirits prefided over the ele¬
ments of earth, air, fire, and water, as well as over the
petfons and affairs of men. Hence they afcribed every
difeafe with which they vvere afflidted to the immedi¬
ate agency of fome evil daemon. When any perfon was
feized with a fever, for inltance, they did not think
it neceffary to fearch for any natural caufe of the dif¬
eafe : it was immediately attributed to fome daemon
which had taken poffeffion of the body of the patient,
] M A G
and which could not to be ejected but by charms and in- Magic,
cantations. ' * — y ^
Thefe fuperftitious notions, which had fpread from
Egypt over all the eaft, the Jews imbibed during their
captivity in Babylon. Hence we find them in the
writings of the New Teftament attributing almoft every
difeafe to which they were incident to the immediate
agency of devils (fee Possession). Many of the fame
impious fuperftitions were brought from Egypt and
Chaldea by Pythagoras, and tranfmitted by him and his
followers to the Platonifts in Greece. This is apparent
from the writers of the life of Pythagoras. Jamblicus,
fpeaking of the followers of that philofopher, fays ex-
prefsly, that they cured certain difeafes by incantations j
and Porphyry adds, that they cured difeafes both of
the mind and of the body by fongs and incantations.
This w;as exa&ly the pra&ice of the Egyptian priefts,
who were all fuppofed to keep up a conftant inter-
courfe with daemons, and to have the power of con-
trouling them by magical charms and facred fongs.
Agreeably to this practice of his mafters, we are told
that Pythagoras directed certain difeafes of the mind,
doubtlefs thofe which he attributed to the agency of
daemons, to be cured partly by incantations, partly by
magical hymns, and partly by mujic.—ym 4/vXetf

That there are different orders of created fpirits,
whether called daemons or angels, whofe powers in-
telle61ual and adlive greatly furpafs the powers of man,
reafon makes probable, and revelation certain. Now
it was the univerfal belief of the ancient nations, fays
the learned Moftieim *, and efpecially of the orientals, * See his
that certain founds and words, for the moft part bar- edition of
barous, were highly grateful, and that others viere^'f^,0^ st
equally difagreeable, to thefe fpirits. Hence, wrhen Sy^em, ^
they wiftied to render a daemon propitious, and to em¬
ploy him on any particular office, the magicians com-
pofed their facred fongs of the words which were be¬
lieved to be agreeable to him 5 and when it was their
intention to drive him from themfelves or others, they
fung in a ftrain which they fancied a daemon could not
hear but with horror. From the fame perfuafion arofe
the cuftom of fufpending from the neck of a fick. per¬
fon, whofe difeafe was fuppofed to be inflidled by a
daemon, an amulet, fometimes made of gold and fome¬
times of parchment on which was written one or more
of thofe words which daemons could not bear either to
hear or to fee : and in a didadfic poem on the healing
art ftill extant, we are taught by Serenus Sammonicus,
that the word Abracadabra is an infallible remedy
for a femitertian fever or ague 5 and to banilh grief of
heart, Marcel/inus thinks nothing more effedtual than
the word x.x^ioiyKuv. In more modern times, as we are
informed by Agrippa, the words ufed by thofe in com-
padl with the devil, to invoke him, and to fucceed in
what they undertake, are, Dies, mies, jefquet, benedoe-
fet, douvima, enitemaus. There are a hundred other
formulas of words compofed at pleafure, or gathered
from feveral different languages, or patched from the
Hebrew or formed in imitation of it. And among
the primitive Chriftians there was a fuperftitious cu¬
ftom, of which we fufpedl fome remains may yet be
found among the illiterate vulgar in different countries.
MAG
Magic, of faftening to the neck of a fick perfon, or to the bed
—v on which he lay, fome text from the New Teftament,
and elpecially the firfl two or three verfes of the gofpel
of St John, as a charm undoubtedly efficacious to baniffi
the difeafe.
That magicians who could thus cure the fick, wTere
likewife believed to have the powxr of inffidting dif-
eafes, and of working miracles, by means of their fub-
fervient daemons, need not be doubted. Ancient writ¬
es of good credit are full of the wonders which they
performed. We {hall mention a few of thofe which
are beft attefied, and inquire uffiether they might not
have been effe&ed by other means than the interpofition
of daemons.
The firft magicians of whom wre read are thofe
who in Egypt oppofed Mofes. And we are told, that,
when Aaron cad down his rod, and it became a fer-
pent, they alfo did the like with their enchantments j
“ for they caft dowm every man his rod, and they be¬
came ferpents.” This was a phenomenon which, it
muft be confeffed, had a very miraculous appearance ;
and yet there feems to have been nothing in it which
might not have been effedfed by flight of hand. The
Egyptians, and perhaps the inhabitants of every coun¬
try where ferpents abound, have the art of depriving
them of their power to do mifehief, fo that they may
be handled without danger. It was eafy for the magi¬
cians, who wrere favoured by the court, to pretend that
they changed their rods into ferpents, by dexterouf-
ly fubftituting one of thofe animals in place of the rod.
In like manner they might pretend to change water
into blood, and to produce frogs ; for if Mofes gave
in thefe inflances, as we know he did in others, any
previous information of the nature of the miracles
which were to be wrought, the magicians might eafi-
ly provide themfelves in a quantity of blood and num¬
ber of frogs fufficient to anfwer their purpofe of de¬
ceiving the people. Beyond this, however, their
power could not go. It flopped where that of all
workers in legerdemain muft have ftopt—at the failure
of proper materials to work with. Egypt abounds
with ferpents ; blood could be eafily procured j and
without difficulty they might have frogs from the ri¬
ver : But when Mofes produced lice from the duft of
the ground, the magicians, who had it not in their
power to col1e6l a fufficient quantity of thefe animals,
were compelled to own this to be an effedl of divine
agency.
The appearance of Samuel to Saul at Endor is the
next miracle, feemingly performed by the power of ma¬
gic, which we ffiall confider. It was a common pre¬
tence of magicians, that they could raife up ghofts
from below, or make dead perfons appear unto them to
declare future events; and the manner of their incanta¬
tion is thus deferibed by Horace :
 Pallor utrafque
Fecerat horrendas afpedlu. Scalpere terram
Unguibus, et pullam divellere mordicus agnam
Coeperunt: cruor in foffam confufus, ut inde
Manes elicerent, animas refponfa daturas.

M A G
With a black lamb’s thick-ftreaming gore,
Whofe members with their teeth they tore j
That they might charm the fprights to tell
Some curious anecdotes trom hell.” FrAxcis.
Whether the witch of Endor made ufe of fuch infer¬
nal charms as thefe, the {acred hiftorian has not in¬
formed us; but Saul addrefled her, as if he believed
that by fome form of incantation flie could recal
from the (late of departed fpirits the foul of the
prophet who had been for fome time dead. In the
fubfequent apparition, however, which was produced,
fome have thought there was nothing more than a
trick, by which a cunning woman impofed upon Saul’s
credulity, making him believe that fome confidant of
her own was the ghoit of Samuel. But had that been
the cafe, (lie would undoubtedly have made the pretend¬
ed Samuel’s anfwer as pleafing to the king as poffible,
both to fave her own life, which appears from the con¬
text to have been in danger, and likewife to have pro¬
cured the larger reward. She would never have told
her fovereign, flie durit not have told him, that he
himfelf ffiould be ffiortly {lain, and his fons with him }
and that the hoft of Ifrael ffiould be delivered into the
hands of the Philiflines. For this reafon many critics,
both Jewiffi and Chriftian, have fuppofed that the ap¬
parition was really a daemon or evil angel, by whofe
affiftance the woman ivas accuflomed to work wonders,
and to foretel future events. But it is furely very-
incredible, that one of the apoftate fpirits of hell Ihould
have upbraided Saul for applying to a forcerefs, or
flrould have accofied him in fuch words as thefe: ‘4 Why
haft thou difquieted me, to bring me up ? Wherefore
doft thou afk of me, feeing the Lord is departed from
thee, and is become thine enemy ! For the Lord hath
rent the kingdom out of thine hand, and given it to
thy neighbour, even to David. Becaufe thou obeyedll
not the voice of the Lord, therefore the Lord hath done
this thing to thee this day.” It is to be obferved far¬
ther, that what was here denounced againft Saul was
really prophetic, and that the event anfwered to the
prophecy in every particular. Now, though we do
not deny that there are created fpirits of penetration
vaftly fuperior to that of the moft enlarged human un-
derftanding } yet we dare maintain, that no finite intel¬
ligence could by its own mere capacity have ever found
out the precife time of the two armies engaging, the
fuccefs of the Philiftines, the confequences of the
victory, and the very names of the perfons that were
to fall in battle. Saul and his fons were indeed men
of tried bravery, and therefore likely to expofe them¬
felves to the greateft danger : but after the menaces
which he received from the apparition, he would have
been impelled, one ftiould think, by common prudence,
either to chicane wuth the enemy, or to retire from
the field without expofing himfelf, his fons, and the
wffiole army, to certain and inevitable deftrmflion ; and
his a£ling differently, with the confequences of his
conduft, wrere events which no limited underftanding
could either forefee or certainly foretel. If to thefe
circumftances wre add the fuddennefs of Samuel’s ap¬
pearance, wdth the effedl which it had upon the for-
cerefs herfelf, we ffiall find reafon to believe, that the
apparition wTas that of no evil daemon. There is not,
we believe, upon record, another inftance of any per-
fon’s
C 349 1

Magic, fon’s pretending to raife a gboft from below, without
' previoufly uling fome magical rites or fome form of
incantation. As nothing of that kind is mentioned in
the cafe before us, it is probable that Samuel appear¬
ed before he was called. It is likewife evident from
the narrative, that the apparition was not what the
woman expeded ; for we are told, that “ when (he
faw Samuel, (lie cried out for fear.” And when the
king exhorted her not to be afraid, and afked what (he
faw, “ the woman faid, I fee gods (elohirri) afcending
out of the earth.” Now, had (he been accuftomed to
-do fuch feats, and known that what (lie faw was only
her fubfervient daemon, it is not conceivable that (he
could have been fo frightened, or have miftaken her
familiar for elohim in any fenfe in whicli that word can
be taken. We are therefore flrongly inclined to adopt
the opinion of thofe who hold that it was Samuel him-
felf who appeared and prophefied, not called up by
the wretched woman or her dmmons, but, to her utter
confufion, and the difgrace of her art, fent by God
to rebuke Saul’s madnefs in a mod afte&ing and mor¬
tifying wTay, and to deter all others from ever ap¬
plying to magicians or daemons for affiftance when re-
fufed comfort from heaven. For though this hypo-
thefis may to a fuperficial thinker feem to tranfgrefs
the rule of Horace—Nec deus interfile See.—wdiich is
as applicable to the interpretation of feripture, as to
the introduftion of fupernatural agency in human com-
pofitions $ yet he wdio has (ludied the theocratical con-
ftitution of Ifrael, the nature of the oflice wThich
was there termed regal, and by wdrat means the admi-
niftration was in emergencies condudfed, will have a
different opinion 5 and at once perceive the dignus viti-
dice nodus.
The hidden and wmnderful deftrudfion of the army
of Brennus the Gaul, has likewife been attributed to
* magic, or, what in this inquiry amounts to the fame
thing, to the interpofition of evil fpirits, whom the
priefts of Apollo invoked as gods. Thofe barbarians
had made an inroad into Greece, and invefted the tem¬
ple of Apollo at Delphi, with a viewT to plunder it of the
facred treafure. Their numbers and courage over¬
powered all oppolition j and they were juft upon the
point of making themfelves mailers of the place, when,
Judin informs us, that, to encourage the bedeged, the
prieds and prophetefs “ adveniffe deum cla?nant; eum-
que fe vidiffe dedlientem in templum per culminis a-
perta fadigia. Dum omnes opem dei fuppficiter im-

This was unquedionably an extraordinary event :
and it mud be aferibed either to the immediate inter-
podtion of the Supreme Being, to natural means, or
to the agency of dsemons : there is no other alterna¬
tive. But it is altogether incredible that the Supreme
Being fhould have miraculoufly interpofed to defend
the temple of a pagan divinity. It is very difficult to
fuppofe that an earthquake, produced in the ordinary
courfe of nature, (hould have been foretold by the.
prieds, or that it could have happened fo opportunely
for the prefervation of their treafure from the hands
of fierce barbarians. Nothing, therefore, it has been
faid, remains, but either to allows the earthquake to
have been produced by evil fpirits, or to deny the
truth of the hidorian’s relation. But the catadrophe
of Brennus’s army is recorded in the fame manner by
fo many ancient waiters of good credit, that we can¬
not call in quedion their veracity j and therefore, be¬
ing unwdlling td admit the agency of daemons into this
affair, it wdll be incumbent on us to (how by what
human contrivance it might have been effected ; for its
arrival at fo critical a juncture will not eafily differ us
to fuppofe it a mere natural event.
“ The inclination of a Pagan pried (fays Bldicp
Warburton f) to affid his god in extremity, will | y?liian
hardly be quedioned j and the inclination of thofe at1 ^
Delphi was not ill feconded by their public manage¬
ment and addrefs. On the fird rumour of Brennus’s
march againd them, they iffued orders, as from the
oracle, to all the region round, forbidding the coun¬
try people to fecret or bear away their wine and pro-
vilions. The effedls of this order fucceeded to their
expe&ations. The half-darved barbarians finding, on
their arrival in Phocis, fo great a plenty of all things,
made (hort marches, difperfed themfelves over the
country, and revelled in the abundance that w'as pro¬
vided for them. This refpite gave time to the friends
and allies of the god to come to his affidance. Their
advantages of dtuation likewife fupported the meafures
which they had taken for a vigorous defence. The
town and temple of Delphi were feated on a bare and
cavernous rock, defended on all fides wdth precipices
indead
“ (A) Called aloud that the god had arrived : That they had feen him leap into the temple through the aper¬
ture in the roof: That whild they were all humbly imploring his help, a youth of more than human beauty,
accompanied by tw'o virgins in armour, bad run to their affidance from the neighbouring temples of Diana and
Minerva j and that they had not only beheld thefe things with their eyes, but bad alfo heard the whizzing
of his bowr and the clangor of his arms. They therefore earnedly exhorted the befieged not to negletff the
heavenly fignal, but to (ally out upon their enemies, and partake with the divinities of the glory of the vic¬
tory.” With thefe words the foldiers being animated, eagerly ruffied to battle : and were themfelves quickly

inftead of walls. A large recefs within affumed the
form of a theatre 5 fo that the ftiouts of foldiers, and
the founds of military inftruments, re-echoing from
rock to rock, and from cavern to cavern, increafed the
clamour to an immenfe degree ; which, as the hifto-
rian obferves, could not but have great effe&s on ig¬
norant and barbarous minds. The playing off theie
panic terrors was not indeed of itfelf fufficient to re-
pulfe and diffipate an hoft of fierce and hungry invaders,
but it enabled the defenders to keep them at bay till
a more folid entertainment was provided for them, m
the exp/ojion and fall of that portion of the rock at
the foot of which the,, greater part of the army lay en¬
camped.
“ Among the caverns in the facred rock, there was
one which, from an intoxicating quality difcovered
in the iteam which iffued from it, was rendered very
famous by being fitted to the recipient of the prieftefs
of Apollo (b). Now, if we only fuppofe this, or any
other of the vapours emitted from the numerous fif-
fures, to be endowed with that un&uous, or otherwife
inflammatory quality, which modern experience fhows
to be common in mines and fubterraneous places, we
can eafily conceive how the priells of the temple
might, without the agency of daemons, be able to
work the wonders which hiftory fpeaks of as effefted
in this tranfa&ion. For the throwing down a lighted
torch or two into a chafm whence fuch a vapour
iffued, would fet the whole into a flame •, which by
fuddenly rarefying and dilating the air, wmuld, like
fired gunpowder, blowT up all before it. That the
priefts, the guardians of the rock, could be long ig¬
norant of fuch a quality, or that they would divulge
it w’hen difcovered, cannot be fuppofed. Strabo re¬
lates, that one Onomarchus, with his companions, as
they were attempting by night to dig their way
through to rob the holy treafury, were frightened
from their work by the violent (baking of the rock ;
and he adds, that the fame phenomenon had defeated
many other attempts of the like nature. Nowq whe¬
ther the tapers which Onomarchus and his companions
were obliged to ufe while they w7ere at work, inflamed
the vapour, or whether the priefts of Apollo heard
them at it, and fet fire to a countermine, it is certain
a quality of this kind would always (land them in ftead.
Such then (prefumes the learned prelate) wTas the expe¬
dient (c) they employed to diflodge this neft of hornets,
which had fettled at the foot of their facred rock $ for
the ftorm of thunder, lightning, and hail, which fol¬
lowed, was the natural effetff of the violent concuflions

thing particular or important in the fa<fts, but becaufe
fome credit feems to have been given to the narration
by the difcerning Cudworth. Philoftratus, in his life
of Apollonius Tyanceus, informs us that a laughing
demoniac at Athens was cured by that magician, who
ejected the evil fpirit by {Treats and menaces 5 and the
biographer adds, that the daemon, at his departure, is
faid to have overturned a ftatue which flood before the
porch where the cure was performed. The other in-
ftance is of the fame magician freeing the city of
Ephefus from the plague, by ftoning to death an old
ragged beggar whom Apollonius called the plague, and
who appeared to be a deemon by his changing himfelf
into the form of a Jljaggcd dog.
That fuch tales as thefe ftiould have been thought
worthy of the flighteft notice by the incomparable au¬
thor of the Intellectual Syltem, is indeed a wonderful
phenomenon in the hiftory of human nature. The
whole ftory of Apollonius Tyanceus, as is now well
known, is nothing better than a collection of the moft
extravagant fables * : but were the narrative fuch as * See Pri-
that credit could be given to the faCts here related,
there appears no neceflity in either cafe for calling in ^’^cker's'
the agency of evil fpirits by the power of magic.— Hijiorv of
The Athenians of that age were a iuperftitious peo- Philofophy,

tifed in the art of deceiving the multitude. For fuch
a man it was eafy to perfuade a friend and confidant Cudworth's

much difficulty the ftatue might be fo undermined as Syjlem.
inevitably to tumble, upon a violent concuflion being
given to the ground at the time of the departure of
the pretended demon. If fo, this feat of magic
dwindles down into a very trifling trick performed by
means both Ample and natural. The other cafe of the
poor man at Ephefus, who was ftoned to death, is
exaftly fimilar to that of thofe innocent women in our
own country, whom the vulgar'in the laft century
were inftigated to burn for the fuppofed crime of witch¬
craft. We have no reafon to fuppofe that an Ephefian
mob was lefs inflammable or credulous than a Britilh
mob, or that Apollonius played his part with lefs (kill
than a Chriftian demonologift j and as the fpirits of
our witches, who were facrificed to folly and fana-
ticifm, were often fuppofed to migrate from their
dead bodies into the bodies of hares or cats accidentally
palling by, fo might this impoftor at Ephefus per¬
fuade his cruel and credulous inftruments, that the
fpirit of their viftim had taken poffeflion of the body
of thefhagged dog.

thefe fiffures was the tripod placed, from which the
prieftefs gave the oracle. Now' we learn from St
Chryfoftom, that the prieftefs w'as a woman : Quae
in tripodes fedens expanfa malignum fpiritum per interna
immiffum, et per genitales partes fubeuntem excipiens,
furore repleretur, ipfaque refolutis crinibus bacchare-
tur, ex ore fpumam emittens, et fie furoris verba loque-
batur.” By comparing this account w'ith that quot¬
ed above from Juftin, which is confirmed both by
Paufanius and by Strabo, it is evident, that what
Chryfoftom calls malignum fpiritum was a particular
kind of vapour blown forcibly through the fiffure of
the rock. But if there be a vapour of fuch a quality
as, if received per partes genitalesy would make a woman
furious, there is furely no neceflity for calling into
the feene at Cumae the agency of a demon or evil fpi-
rit. Befides, it is to be remembered, that in all my-
ftical and magical rites, fuch as this w'as, both the
priefts, and the perfons confulting them, prepared
themfelves by particular kinds of food., and fometimes,

which they had done or intended. This being the

Efficiently account for the change of the fibyl’s ap¬
pearance, even though the inhaled vapour (hould not Magic,
have poffeffed that efficacy v/hich Chryfoftom and '“■“■"V'—
Juftin attribute to it. Even fome forts of our ordi¬
nary food occafion ftrange dreams, for which onions
in particular are remarkable. Exceffive drunkennefs,
as is well known, produces a diforder named by the
bacchanalians of this country the blue devils, which
confifts of an immenfe number of fpe&res, accompa¬
nied with extreme horror to the perfon who fees
them. From thefe faffs, which cannot be denied
there muft arife a fufpicion, that by ufing very unna¬
tural food, fuch as human blood, the vileft of infefts,
ferpents, and medicated cakes, by (hutting themfelves
up in folitudes and caves, and by devifing every me¬
thod to excite horrid and dreadful ideas or images in
the fancy, the ancient magicians might by natural
means produce every phenomenon which they attri¬
buted to their gods or demons. Add to this, that in
ancient times magic wTas ftudied as a fcience. Now,
as we cannot fuppofe that every one who ftudied it
intended abfolutely nothing, or that all who believed
in it were wholly deceived ; what can we infer, but
that the fcience confided in the knowledge of thofe
drugs which produced the phantoms in the imagina¬
tion, and of the method of preparing and properly
employing them for that purpofe ? The celebrated
Friar Bacon indeed, as far back as the 13th century,
wrote a book de Nul/itate Magice: but though we (hould
allow that this book proved to demonftration, that in
his time no fuch thing as magic exifted, it never could
prove that the cafe had always been fo. At that
time almoft all the fciences w'ere loft ; and why not
magic as w'ell^as others ? It is likewife an undoubted
faff, that magic at all times prevailed among the A-
fiatics and Africans more than among the Europeans.
The reafon doubtlefs w'as, that the former had the re-
quifites for the art in much greater perfeftion than
wre. Human facrifices were frequent among them; they
had the moft poifonous ferpents, and the greateft va¬
riety of vegetable poifons, together with that power¬
ful narcotic opium j all which were of effential ufe in
myftical and magic rites. They had, befides, a burn¬
ing fun, frightful deferts and folitudes •, which, toge¬
ther with extreme fading, were all called in to their
affiftance, and were fufficient to produce, by natural
means, the moft wonderful phenomena which have ever
been attributed to magical incantations. Even in our
own days, we have the teftimony of twro travellers,
whom we cannot fufpeft to be either liars or enthufi-
afts, that both the Indians and Africans perform feats
for which neither they nor the moft enlightened Eu¬
ropeans can account. The one is Mr Grofe, who vi-.
fited the Eaft Indies about the year 1762 j and the
other is Mr Bruce, who informs us, that the inhabi¬
tants of the weftern coaft of Africa pretend to hold
a communication with the devil, and verify their affer-
tions in fuch a manner that neither he nor other tra¬
vellers know what to make of it: but it does not from
this follow', that Mr Bruce believed that communica¬
tion to be real. We have all feen one of the moft il¬
literate men that ever affumed the title of DoElor, per¬
form feats very furprifing, and fuch as even a philo-
fopher w'ould have been puzzled to account for, if he
had not been previoufly let into the fecret; and yet na
man fuppofes that Katlerfelio holds any communica¬

' v " tended it among people whofe minds he fuppofed un¬
enlightened.
Still it may be obje&ed, that we have a vaft num¬
ber of hiftories of witches, who in the laft century
confeffed, that they were prefent with the devil at cer¬
tain meetings j that they were carried through the air,
and faw many ftrange feats performed, too numerous
and too ridiculous to be here mentioned. The belt
anfwer to this objection feems to be that given by Dr
*Manchef-Yzxnar in his effay on Popular Illufions *. “ The fo-
ter Trartf- lemn meeting of witches (fays he) is fuppofed to be
aftions, put beyGnd all doubt by the numerous confeilions of
vol. iu. criminals, who have defcribed their ceremonies, named
the times and places of their meetings, with the per-
fons prefent, and who have agreed in their relations,
though feparately delivered. But I would obferve,
firft, that the circumftances told of thofe feftivals are
in themfelves ridiculous and incredible •, for they are
reprefented as gloomy and horrible, and yet with a
mixture of childilh and extravagant fancies, more like¬
ly to difguft and alienate than conciliate the minds
of their guefts. They have every appearance of un-
eafy dreams. Sometimes the devil and his fubje&s
Jbi/ mafs ; fometimes he preaches to them $ more com¬
monly he was feen in the form of a black goat, fur-
rounded by imps in a thoufand frightful Ihapes j but
none of thefe forms are new, they all referable known
quadrupeds or reptiles. Secondly, I obferve, that there
is direft proof furnilhed even by demonologilts, that all
thofe fuppofed journeys and entertainments were no¬
thing more than dreams. Perfons accufed of witch¬
craft have been repeatedly wTatched about the time
they had fixed for their meeting : they have been feen
to anoint themfelves with foporific compofitions •, af¬
ter which they fell into profound fleep •, and on awak¬
ing feveral hours afterwards, they have related their
journey through the air, with their amufement at the
feftival, and have named the perfons whom they fawr
there.” This is exadlly conformable to the praftice
of the ancient magicians and diviners, and feems to be
the true way of accounting, as well for many of the
phenomena of magic, as for that extravagant and
(hameful fuperftition which prevailed fo much during
part of the laft century, and by which fuch numbers
of innocent men and women were cruelly put to
death (c). We may indeed be affured, that the devil
has it not in his power to reverfe in a fingle inftance
the laws of nature without a divine permiftion ; and
we can conceive but one occafion (fee Possession)
on which fuch permiffion could be given confidently
with the wifdom and the goodnefs of God. All the
tales, therefore, of diabolical agency in magic and
witchcraft mult undoubtedly be falfe j for a power,
which the devil is not himfelf at liberty to exert, he
cannot communicate to a human creature. Were the
cafe otherwdfe ; were thofe powers, “ which (according
to Johnfon) only the controul of Omnipotence re-

racles, and either to infli£l or to remove difeafes at the
defire of their capricious votaries, how comfortlefs and
wretched wrould be the life of man ! But the matter has
been long ago determined by the failure of Pharaoh’s
magicians j who, though by legerdemain they imitated
fome of the miracles of Mofes, could not form the vileft
infedt, or ftand before the difeafe which he infli&ed up¬
on them as well as upon others.
The revival of learning, and the fuccefs with which
the laws of nature have been inveftigated, have long
ago banifhed this fpecies of magic from all the en¬
lightened nations of Europe. Among ourfelves, none
but perfons grofsly illiterate pay the leaft regard to
magical charms ; nor are they anywhere abroad more
prevalent than among the inhabitants of Lapland and
Iceland. Thefe people, indeed, place an abfolute
confidence in the effedls of certain idle words and ac¬
tions : and ignorant failors from other parts of the
world are deceived by their aflertions and their cere¬
monies. The famous magical drum of the Laplanders
is ftill in conftant ufe in that nation ; and Scheffer, in
his Hiftory of Lapland, has given an account of its
ftrudlure.
This inftrument is made of beech, pine, or fir, fplit
in the middle, and hollowed on the flat fide w'here the
drum is to be made. The hollow is of an oval figure ;
and is covered with a Ikin clean dreffed, and painted
with figures of various kinds, fuch as ftars, funs and
moons, animals and plants, and even countries, lakes
and rivers j and of later days, fince the preaching of
Chriftianity among them, the afts and fufferings of
our Saviour and his apoftles are often added among
the reft. All thefe figures are feparated by lines into
three regions or clufters.
There is, befides thefe parts of the drum, an index
and a hammer. The index is a bundle of brafs or iron
rings, the biggeft of which has a hole in its middle,
and the fmalier ones are hung to it. The hammer or
drumftick is made of the horn of a rein-deer ; and with
this they beat the drum fo as to make thefe rings move,
they being laid on the top for that purpofe. In the
motion of thefe rings about the pictures figured on the
drum, they fancy to themfelves fome predidlion in re¬
gard to the things they inquire about.
What they principally inquire into by this inftru¬
ment, are three things, i. What facrifices wall prove
moft acceptable to their gods. 2. What fuccefs they
(hall have in their feveral oceupations, as hunting, filh-
ing, curing of difeafes, and the like ; and, 3. What is
doing in places remote from them. On thefe feveral
occafions they ufe feveral peculiar ceremonies, and
place themfelves in various odd poftures as they beat
the drum ; which influences the rings to the one or
the other fide, and to come nearer to the one or the
other fet of figures. And when they have done
this, they have a method of calculating a difcovery,
which they keep as a great fecret, but which feems

Magic Square, a fquare figure, formed of a feries of
numbers in mathematical proportion •, fo difpofed in pa¬
rallel and equal ranks, as that the fums of each row,
taken either perpendicularly, horizontally, or diagonal¬
ly, are equal.
Let the feveral numbers which compofe any fquare
number (for inftance, t, 2, 3, 4, 5, &c. to 25 inclufive,
the fquare number) be difpoled, in their natural order,
after each other in a fquare figure of 25 cells, each in
its cell 5 if now you change the order of thefe numbers,
and difpofe them in the cells in fuch manner, as that
the five numbers which fill a horizontal rank of cells,
being added together, (hall make the fame fum with
the five numbers in any other rank of cells, whether
horizontal or vertical, and even the fame number with
the five in each of the two diagonal ranks: this dif-
pofition of numbers is called a magic fquare, in oppofi-
tion to the former difpofition, which is called a natural
fquare. See the figures following :
Natural Square. Magic Square.
One would imagine that thefe magic fquares had
that name given then, in regard this property of all
their ranks, which, taken any way, make always the
fame fum, appeared extremely furprifmg, efpecially in
certain ignorant ages, when mathematics palfed for
magic ; but there is a great deal of reafon to fufpedt,
that thefe fquares merited their name ftill farther, by
the fuperftitious operations they were employed in, as
the conftrudlion of talifmans, &c. for, according to
the childiih philofophy of thofe days, which attributed
virtues to numbers, what virtues might not be expedt-
ed from numbers fo wonderful ?
However, what was at firft the vain practice of ma¬
kers of talifmans and conjurors, has fince become the
lubjedl of a ferious refearch among mathematicians ;
not that they imagine it will lead them to any thing
of folid uie or advantage (magic fquares favour to®
much of their original to be of much ufe) j but only
as it is a kind of play, where the difficulty makes the
merit, and it may chance to produce fome new views
of numbers, which mathematicians will not lofe the oc-
cafion of. >
Eman. Mofchopulus, a Greek author of no great
antiquity, is the firll; that appears to have fpoken of
magic fquares: and by the age wherein he lived, there
is reafon to imagine he did not look on them merely
as a mathematician. However, he has left us fome
rules for their conilru&ion. In the treatife of Cor.
Agrippa, fo much accufed of magic, we find the fquares
of feven numbers, viz. from three to nine inclufive,
difpofed magically ; and it mult not be fuppofed that
thofe feven numbers were preferred to all the other
without fome very good reafon : in effeft, it is becaufe
their fquares, according to the fyfiem of Agrippa and
his followers, are planetary. The fquare of 3, for in-
ilance, belongs to Saturn j that of 4 to Jupiter ; that Magic
of 5 to Mars ; that of 6 to the Sun ; that of 7 to Ve- Stluare-
nus j that of 8 to Mercury ; and that of 9 to the' 'r"~*
Moon. M. Bachet applied himfelf to the lludy of
magic fquares, on the hint he had taken from the pla¬
netary Iquares of Agrippa, as being unacquainted with
the work of Mofchopulus, which is only in manufcript
in the French king’s library; and, without the affift-
ance of any author, he found out a new method for
thofe fquares whofe root is uneven, for inftance 25,
49, &c. but he could not make any thing of thofe
wffiofe root is even.
Alter him came M. Frenicle, who took the fame
fubjedl in hand. A certain great algebraift was of
opinion, that whereas the 16 numbers which compofe
the fquare might be difpofed 20922789888000 differ¬
ent ways in a natural fquare (as from the rules of com¬
bination it is certain they may), they could not be
difpofed in a magic fquare above 16 different ways:;
but M. Frenicle ffiowed, that they might be thus dif-
poled 878 different ways: whence it appears how much
his method exceeds the former, which only yielded the
55th part of magic fquares of that of M. Frenicle.
To this inquiry he thought fit to add a difficulty
that had not yet been confidered : the magic fquare of
7, for inftance, being conftrufted, and its 49 cells till¬
ed, if the two horizontal ranks of cells, and, at the
fame time, the two vertical ones, the moft remote from
the middle, be retrenched 5 that is, if the whole bor¬
der or circumference of the fquare be taken away,
there will remain a fquare whole root will be 5, and
which will only confift of 25 cells. Nov,7 it is not at
all furprifing that the fquare ffiould be no longer ma¬
gical, becaufe the ranks of the large ones were not in¬
tended to make the fame fum, excepting when taken
entire with all the feven numbers that fill their feven
cells j fo that being mutilated each of two cells, and
having loft two of their numbers, it may be well ex¬
pected, that their remainders will not any longer make
the fame fum. But M. Frenicle would not be fatis*
fied, unlefs when the circumference or border of the .
magic fquare was taken away, and even any circum¬
ferences at pleafure, or, in fine, feveral circumferences
at once, the remaining fquare was ftill magical-: which
laft condition, no doubt, made thefe fquares vaftly
more magical than ever.
Again, He inverted that condition, and required
that any circumference taken at pleafure, or even fe¬
veral circumferences, ffiould be infeparable from the
fquare j that is, that it ihould ceafe to be magical when
they were removed, and yet continue magical after the
removal of any of the reft. M. Frenicle, however,
gives no general demonilration of his methods, and
frequently feems to have no other guide but cbance.
It is true, his book was not publilhed by himfelf, nor
did it appear till after his death, viz. in 1693.
In 1703, M. Poignard, canon of Bruilels, publiffi-
ed a treatife of fublime magic fquares. Before him
there had been no magic fquares made but for feriefes
of natural numbers that formed a fquare; but M.
Poignard made two very confiderable improvements.
1. Inftead of taking all the numbers that fill a fquare,
for inftance the 36' fucceffive numbers, which would
fill all the cells of a natural Iquare whofe fide is 6, he
only takes as many fucceffive numbers as there are units
in

MAG [35
Magic in the fide of the fquare, which, in this cafe, are fix ;
Square. an(j thefe fix numbers alone he difpofes in fuch manner
—v~—' in the 36 cells, that none of them .are repeated twice
in the fame rank, whether it be horizontal, vertical, or
diagonal $ whence it follows, that all the ranks, taken
all the ways poffible, muft always make the fame fum,
which M. Poignard calls repeated progreffion. 2. In-
flead of being confined to take thefe numbers accord¬
ing to the feries and fucceffion of the natural numbers,
that is, in an arithmetical progreffion, he takes them
likewife in a geometrical progreffion, and even in an
harmonical progreffion. But with thefe two lafl pro-
greffions the magic muft neceffarily be different from
what it was : in the fquares filled with numbers in
geometrical progreffion, it confifts in this., that the
products of all the ranks are equal •, and in the har¬
monical progreffion, the numbers of all the ranks con¬
tinually follow that progreffion: he makes fquares of
each of thefe three progreffions repeated.
This book of M. Poignard gave occafion to M. de
la Hire to turn his thoughts the fame w^ay, which he
did with fuch fuccefs, that he feems to have well nigh
completed the theory of magic fquares. He firft con-
fiders uneven fquares: all his predeceffois on the lub-
jecft having found the conftruftion of even ones by
much the moft difficulty for which reafon M. de la
Hire referves thofe for the laft. I his excefs of diffi¬
culty may arife partly from hence, that the numbers
are taken in arithmetical progreffion. Now in that
progreffion, if the number of terms be uneven, that in
the middle has fome properties, which may be of fer-
vice y for inftance, being multiplied by the numbei of
terms in the progreffion, the product is equal to the
fum of all the terms.
M. de la Hire propofes a general method for un-
*even (quares, which has fome fimilitude with the theo¬
ry of compound motions, fo ufeful and fertile in.me¬
chanics. As that confifts in decompounding motions,
and refolving them into others more Ample y lo does
M. de la Hire’s method confift in refolving the .fquare
that is to be conftrmfted into two fimple and primitive
fquares. It muft be owmed, however, it is not quite jo
eafy to conceive thefe two fimple and primitive fquaies
in the compound or perfect fquare, as in an oblique mo¬
tion to imagine a parallel and perpendicular one.
Suppofe a fquare of cells, whole root is uneven, foi
irftance 7 y and that its 49 cells are to be filled magi¬
cally with numbers, for inftance the firft 7 y M. de la
Hire, on the one fide, takes the firft 7 numbers, be¬
ginning with unity, and ending wfith the root 7 y
and on the other j, and all its multiples to 49, exclu-
fively y and as thefe only make fix numbei s, he adds o,
which makes this an arithmetical progreffion of 7
terms as well as the other y o. 7. 14- 21 • 35* 42,
This done, with the firft progreffion repeated, he fills
the f|uare of the root magically : In order to this,
he writes in the firft feven cells of the firft horizontal
rank the feven numbers propofed in what order he
pleafes, for that is abfolutely indifferent y and it is
proper to obferve here, that thefe feven numbers may
be ranged in 5040 different manners in the lame rank.
The order in which they are placed in the firft hori¬
zontal rank, be it what it will, is that which dc>ei-
mines ’heir order in all the reft. For the fecond bo-
-rizontal rank, he places in its firft ceil, either the
5 y M A G
third, the fourth, the fifth, or the fixth number, from
the firft number of the firft rank y and after that writes
the fix others in order as they follown For the third
horizontal rank, he obferves the fame method with re¬
gard to the fecond that he obferved in the fecond with
regard to the firft, and fo of the reft. For inftance,
fuppofe the firft horizontal rank filled with the feven
numbers in their natural order, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 y
the fecond horizontal rank may either commence with
3, with 4, with 5, or wfith 6 : but in this inftance it
commences with 3 5 the third rank therefore muft com¬
mence with 5, the fourth wfith
7, the fifth with 2, the fixth
with 4, and the feventh with 6.
The commencement of the ranks
which follow the firft being thus
determined, the other numbers,
as we have already oblerved,
muft be written down in the or¬
der wherein they ftand in the
firft, going on to 5, 6, and 7,    •
and returning to 1,2, &c. till
every number in the firfFrank be found in every rank
underneath, according to the order arbitrarily pitched
upon at firft. By this means it is evident, that no
number whatever can be repeated twfice in the fame
rank y and by confequence, that the feven numbers x,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, being in each rank, muft of neceffity
make the fame fum.
It appears, from this example, that the arrangement
of the numbers in the firft rank being chofen at plea-
fure, the other ranks may be continued in four differ¬
ent manners : and fince the firft rank may have 504®
different arrangements, there are no lefs than 20,160
different manners of conftru&ing the magic fquare of

fary to take the terms in an arithmetical progreffion y

of the fame term in one of the two diagonals, and on¬
ly to take in the cafe wherein that repetition would
prevent the diagonal from being juft j which cafe be¬
ing abfolutely dilregarded when we computed that the
fquare of 7 might have 20,160 different conftru&ions,
it is evident that by taking that cafe in, it mull have
vaftly more.
1 o begin the fecond rank with any other number
befides the fecond and the laft, mufl not, however, be
looked on as an univerfal rule : it holds good for the
fquare of 7 j but if the fquare of 9, for inltance, were
to be conitructed, and the fourth figure of the firlf
horizontal rank were pitched on for the firft of the
fecond, the confequence would be, that the fifth and
eighth horizontal ranks would likewife commence
w.th the lame number, which would therefore be re¬
peated three times in the fame vertical rank, and oc-
cafion other repetitions in all the reft. The general
rule, therefore, muft be conceived thus : Let the
number in the firft rank pitched on, for the commence¬
ment of the fecond, have fuch an exponent of its
quota; that is, let the order of its place be fuch, as that
if an unit be taken from it, the remainder will not be
any juft quota part of the root of the fquare ; that is,
cannot divide it equally. If, for example, in the fquare
of 7, the third number of the firft horizontal rank be
pitched on for the firft of the fecond, fuch conftruc-
tion will be juft j becaufe the exponent of the place
of that number, viz. 3, fubtra&ing 1, that is, 2 can¬
not divide 7. Thus alfo might the fourth number of
the fame firft rank be chofen, becaufe 4—1, viz. 3,
cannot divide 7 j and, for the fame reafon, the fifth
or fixth number might be taken : but in the fquare of
9, the fourth number of the firft rank muft not be ta¬
ken, becaufe 4—1, viz. 3, does divide 9. The rea¬
fon of this rule will appear very evidently, by confi-
dering in what manner the returns of the fame num¬
bers do or do not happen, taking them always in the
fame manner in any given feries. And hence it fol¬
lows, that the fewer divifions the root of any fquare
to be conftrufted has, the more different manners of
conffrudling it there are j and that the prime numbers,
i. e. thofe which have no divifions, as 5, 7, 11, 13,
&c. are thole whofe fquares will admit of the moft va¬
riations in proportion to their quantities.
The fquares conftru&ed according to this method
have fome particular properties not required in the
problem ; for the numbers that compofe any rank pa¬
rallel to one of the two diagonals, are ranged in the
fame order with the numbers that compofe the diago¬
nal to which they are parallel. And as any rank pa¬
rallel to a diagonal muft neceffarily be fhorter, and
have fewer cells than the diagonal itfelf, by adding
to it the correfpondent parallel,
which has the number of cells
by which the other falls Ihort of
the diagonal, the numbers of
thofe two parallels, placed as it
were end to end, ftill follow the
fame order with thofe of the
diagonal: befides that their funs
are likewife equal j fo that they
are magical on another account.

all its ranks making the fame
fum, it is evident, that if we
bring the two into one, by adding together the num¬
bers of the two correfponding cells of the two fquares,
that is, the two numbers of the firft of each, the two
numbers of the fecond, of the third, &.c. and difpofe
them in the 49 correfponding cells of a third fquare, it
will likewife be magical in regard to its rank, formed
by the addition of equal fums to equal fums, which muft
of neceftlty be equal among themfelves. All that re¬
mains in doubt is, whether or no, by the addition of
the correfponding cells of the two firft fquares, all the
cells of the third will be filled in fuch manner, as
that each not only contains one of the numbers of
the progreflion from 1 to 49, but alfo that this num¬
ber be different from any of the reft, which is the end
and defign of the whole operation.
As to this it muft be obferved, that if in the con-
ftrudftion of the fecond primitive fquare care has been
taken, in the commencement of the fecond horizontal
rank, to obferve an order with regard to the firft, diffe¬
rent from what was obferved in the conftruction of
the firft fquare j for inflance, if
the fecond rank of the firft fquare
began with the third term of the
firft rank, and the fecond rank
of the fecond fquare commence
with the fourth of the firft rank,
as in the example it a&ually
does j each number of the firft
fquare may be combined once,
and only once, by addition with
all the numbers of the fecond.
And as the numbers of the firft
are here 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and thofe of the fecond,
O, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42; by combining them in this
manner we have all the numbers in the progreflion from
1 to 49, wuthout having any of them repeated 5 which
is the perfe<ft magic fquare propofed.
The neceflity of conftrufting the twro primitive
fquares in a different manner does not at all hinder but
that each of the 20,160 conftru&ions of the one may
be combined with all the 20,160 conftnnftions of the
other: of confequence, therefore, 20,160 multiplied
by itfelf, which makes 406,425,600, is the number of
different conftru£tions that may be made of the per-
fe£t fquare, wdiich here confifts of the 49 numbers of
the natural progreflion. But as we have already ob¬
ferved, that a primitive fquare of fcven numbers re¬

As to the even fquares, he condruds them like the
uneven ones, by two primitive fquares ; but the con-
llrudion of primitives is different in general, and may
be fo a great number of ways : and thofe general dif¬
ferences admit of a great number of particular varia¬
tions, which give as many different conitrudions of
the fame even fquare. It fcarce feems poffible to de¬
termine exadly, either how many general differences
there may be between the conltrudtion of the primitive
fquares of an even fquare and an uneven one, nor how
many particular variations each general difference may
admit of; and, of confequence, w’e are (till far from
being able to determine the number of different con¬
itrudions of all thofe that may be made by the primi¬
tive fquares.
The ingenious Dr Franklin feems to have carried
this curious fpeculation farther than any of his prede-
cetfbrs in the fame wray. He has conffruded not only
a magic fquare of fquares, but likewife a magic circle
of circles, of which we lhall give fome account for
the amufement of our readers. The magic fquare of
fquares is formed by dividing the great fquare, as in
Plate CCXCVIII. The great fquare is divided into
256 fmall fquares, in which all the numbers from I
to 256 are placed in 16 columns, wdiich may be taken
either horizontally or vertically. The properties are as
follow :
1. The fum of the 16 numbers in each column, ver¬
tical and horizontal, is 2056.
2. Every half column, vertical and horizontal, makes
1028, or half of 2056.
3. Half a diagonal afcending added to half a dia¬
gonal defcending, makes 2056 taking thefe half dia¬
gonals from the ^ids of any fide of the fquare to the
middle thereof 5 and fo reckoning them either upward
or dowmward, or lidewife from left to right hand, or
from right to left.
4. The fame, w ith all the parallels to the half dia¬
gonals, as many as can be drawm in the great fquare *,
for any tw7o of them being direded upward and down-
w7ard, from the place where they begin to that where
they end, their fums wall make 2056. The fame
dowmward and upward in like manner : or all the fame
if taken fidewufe to the middle, and back to the fame
fide again. N. B. One fet of thefe half diagonals and
their parallels is drawn in the fame fquare upward and
downward. Another fuch fet may be drawn from
any of the other three fides.
5. The four corner numbers in the great fquare,
added to the four central numbers therein, make 1028;
equal to the half fum of any vertical or horizontal co¬
lumn which contains 16 numbers 5 and equal to half a
diagonal or its parallel.
6. If a fquare hole (equal in breadth to four of
the little fquares) be cut in a paper, through which
any of the 16 little ,fquares in the great fquare may be
feen, and the paper be laid on the great fquare, the
7 ] MAG
ium oi all the ] 6 numbers, feen through the hole, is Magic
equal to the fum of the 1 6 numbers in any horizontal Scl'uue•
or vertical column, viz. to 2o<;6.
The magic circle of circles, Plate CCXCVIII. is com-
pofed of a feries of numbers from 12 to 75 inclufive, di¬
vided into eight concentric circular fpaces, and ranged in
eight radii of numbers, with the number 1 2 in the cen¬
tre ; which number, like the centre, is common to all
thefe circular fpaces, and to all the radii.
The numbers are fo placed, that the fum of all thofe
in either of the, concentric circular fpaces above men¬
tioned, together with the central number 12, make 360 j
equal to the number of degrees in a circle.
The numbers in each radius alfo, together w7ith the
central number 12, make juft 360.
The numbers in half of any of the above circular
fpaces, taken either above or below' the double hori¬
zontal line, with half the central number 12, make
180 ; equal to the number of degrees in a femicircle.
If any four adjoining numbers be taken, as if in a
fquare, in the radial divifions of thefe circular fpaces,
the fum of thefe, with half the central number, makes
180.
There are, moreover, included, four fets of other
circular fpaces, bounded by circles which are eccentric
with refpedt to the common centre •, each of thefe fets
containing five fpaces. The centres of the circles
which bound them are at A, B, C, and D. The fet
whofe centre is at A is bounded by dotted lines j the
fet whole centre is at C is bounded by lines of Ihort
unconnefted ftrokes 5 and the fet round D is bounded
by lines of unconnedted longer ftrokes, to diftinguifli
them from one other. In drawing this figure by
hand, the fet of concentric circles Ihould be drawm
with black ink, and the four different fets of eccentric
circles with four kinds of ink of different colours as
blue, red, yellow7, and green, for diilinguiftiing them
readily from one another. Thefe fets of eccentric cir¬
cular fpaces interfedl thofe of the concentric, and each
other ; and yet the numbers contained in each of the
eccentric fpaces, taken all around through any of the
20 w7hich are eccentric, make the fame fum as thofe in
the concentric, namely 360, when the central number
12 is added. Their halves alfo, taken above or below
the double horizontal line, with half the central num¬
ber, make 180.
Obferve, that there is not one of the numbers but
what belongs at leaft to two of the circular fpaces,
fome to three, fome to four, fome to five ; and yet they
are all fo placed as never to break the required number
360 in any of the 28 circular fpaces within the primi¬
tive circle.
To bring thefe matters in view, all the numbers as
above mentioned are taken out, and placed in feparate
columns as they ftand around both the concentric and
eccentric circular fpaces, always beginning with the
outermoft and ending with the innermoft of each fet,
and alfo the numbers as they ftand in the eight radii,
from the circumference to the centre : the common
central number 12 being placed the loweft in each co= -
lumn.

MAGLIABECHI, Antony, a perfon of great

born at Florence in 1633. His father died when he
was only feven years old. His mother had him taught
grammar and drawing, and then put him apprentice
to one of the belt goldfmiths in Florence. When he
was about 16 years old, his paffion for learning began
to appear j and he laid out all his money in buy¬
ing books. Becoming acquainted with Michael Er-
mini, librarian to the cardinal de Medicis, he foon per-
fefted himfelf by his affiftance in the Latin .tongue,
and in a little time became mafter of the Hebrew.
His name toon became famous among the learned. A
prodigious memory was his diftinguiffiing talent ; and

countenance, pretended it wTas loft, and requefted Ma-

He generally (hut himfelf up the w’hole day, and open¬
ed his doors in the evening to the men of letters who
came to converfe wdth him. His attention w7as fo ab-
forbed by his ftudies, that he often forgot the moft
urgent wants of nature. Cofmo III. grand duke of
Florence, made him his librarian } but he ftill conti¬
nued negligent in his drefs, and fimple in his manners.
An old cloak ferved him for a morning gowm in the
day and for bed-clothes at night. U he duke, however,
provided for him a commodious apartment in his pa¬
lace, which he was with difficulty perfuaded to take
poffeffion of; but which he quitted four months after,
and returned to his houfe. He was remarkable for his
extraordinary modefty, his fincerity, and his benefi¬
cence, which his friends often experienced in their
wants. He was a patron of men of learning ", and had
the higheft pleafure in affifting them with his advice
and information, and in furnilhing them wTith books
and manufcripts. He had the utmoft averfion at any
thing that looked like conftraint; and therefore the
grand duke always difpenfed with his perfonal attend¬
ance, and fent him his orders in writing. Though he
lived a very fedentary life, he reached the Sift year of
his age ; and died in the midft of the public applaufe,
r after enjoying, during the latter part of his lite, luch
affluence as few have ever procured by their learning.
By his will, he left a very fine library to the public,
with a fund for its fupport.

1. The inhabitants of Privernum being fubdued and
taken prifoners after a revolt, one of them being alk-
ed by a Roman fenator, who was for putting them all
to death, what punifhment he and his fellow captives
deferved ? anfwered with great intrepidity, “ We de-
ferve that punifhment which is due to men wffio are
jealous of their liberty, and think themfelves worthy
of it.” Plautinus perceiving that his anfwer exafpe-
rated fome of the fenators, endeavoured to prevent
the ill effedls of it, by putting a milder queftion to
the prifoner: How would you behave (fays he) if
Rome fhould pardon you ?” “ Our conduct (replied
the generous captive) depends upon yours. If the
peace you grant be an honourable one, you may de¬
pend on a conftant‘fidelity on our parts : if the terms
of it be hard and dilhonourable, lay no ftrefs on our
adherence to you.” Some of the judges conftrued
thefe words as menaces", but the wifer part finding
in them a great deal of magnanimity, cried out, that
a nation whofe only defire w’as liberty, and their only
fear that of lofing it, w7as wmrthy to become Roman.
Accordingly, a decree paffed in favour of the prifon¬
ers, and Privernum was declared a municipium. Thus
the bold fincerity of one man faved his country, and
gained it the privilege of being incorporated into the
Roman ftate.
2. Subrius Flavius, the Roman tribune, being im¬
peached for having confpired againft the life of the
emperor Nero, not only owned the charge, but glori¬
ed in it. Upon the emperor’s afkmg him what pro¬
vocation he had given him to plot his death. Be-
caufe I abhorred thee (faid Flavius), though there was
not in the w’hole army one more zealoufly attached to
thee than I, fo long as thou didft merit affeblion ; but
1 began to hate thee when thou becameft the murderer
of thy mother, the murderer of thy brother and wife,
a charioteer, a comedian, an incendiary, and a tyrant.”
Tacitus tells us, that the whole confpiracy afforded no¬
thing which proved fo bitter and pungent ta Nero as
this reproach. He ordered Flavius to be immediately
put to death, wffiich he fuffered with amazing intrepidity.
When the executioner defired him to ftretch out his
neck valiantly, “ I wiffl (replied he) thou mayeft ftrike
as valiantly.”
3. When the Scythian ambaffadors waited on Alex¬
ander the Great, they gazed attentively upon him for
a long time without fpeaking a word, being very pro¬
bably furprifed, as they formed a judgement of men
from their air and ftature, to find that his did not an¬
fwer the high idea they entertained of him from his
fame. At laft, the oldeft of the ambafihdors (accord-
ing to Q. Curtius) addreffed him thus! “ Had the
gods given thee a body proportionable to thy ambition,
the wffiole univerfe would have been too little for thee.

tradled between equals j and they are efteemed equals

but do not imagine that thofe whom thou conquereft
can love thee.”
4. Richard I. king of England, having invefted the
caftle of Chalus, was Ihot in the fhoulder with an ar¬
row j an unfkilful furgeon endeavouring to extraft the
weapon, mangled the flefti in fuch a manner, that a
gangrene enfued. The caftle being taken, and per¬
ceiving he fhould not live, he ordered Bertram de
Gourdon, who had (hot the arrow, to be brought in¬
to his prefence. Bertram being come, “fc\Vhat harm
(faid the king) did I ever do thee, that thou
ftrouldft kill me ?” The other replied with great mag¬
nanimity and courage, “ You killed with your own
hand my father and two of my brothers, and you
likewife defigned to have killed me. You may now
fatiate your revenge. I fhould cheerfully fuffer all
the torments that can be infli&ed, were I fure of hav¬
ing delivered the world of a tyrant who filled it wuth
blood and carnage.” This bold and fpirited anfwer
ftruck Richard with remorfe. He ordered the pri-
foner to be prefented with one hundred {hillings, and
fet at liberty: but Maccardec, one of the king’s
friends, like a true ruffian, ordered him to be flayed

Floras to 300,000 men ; the Roman army confifted

The magnet is alfo called Lapis Heracleus, from
Heraclea, a city of Magnefia, a port of the ancient
Lydia, where it is faid to have been firft found, and
from which it is ufually fuppofed to have taken its
name. Though others derive the word from a fhep-
herd named Magnes, wflio firft difeovered it with the
iron of his crook on Mount Ida. It is alfo called
Lapis Nauticus, from its ufe in navigation ; and fide-
rites, from its attradling iron, which the Greeks call
<r<^ng«s.
The ancients reckoned five kinds of magnets, differ¬
ent in colour and virtue the Ethiopic, Magnefian,
Boeotic, Alexandrian, and Natolian. They alfo took
it to be male and female : but the chief ufe they made
of it was in medicine ; efpecially for the cure of burns
and defluxions on the eyes.—The moderns, more for¬
tunate in its application, employ it to conduft them iu
their voyages. See Navigation.
The moft diftinguiihing properties of the magnet are.
That it attracts iron, and that it points to the poles of
the world ; and in other circumftanccs alfo dips or in¬
clines

AttraSlive Power of the Magnet was known to the
ancients , and is mentioned even by Plato and Euri-
/ pides, who call it the Herculean fane, becaufe it com¬
mands iron, which fubdues every thing elfe : but the
knowledge of its directive power, whereby it difpofes
it^ poles along the meridian of every place, and occa-
lions needles, pieces of iron, &c. touched with it, to
point nearly north and fouth, is of a much later date j
though the exadt time of its difcovery, and the difco-
verer himfelf, are yet in the dark. The firft mention we
have of it is in i 260, when Marco Polo the Venetian
is faid by fome to have introduced the mariner’s compafs j
though not as an invention of his owm, but as derived
from the Chinefe, who are faid to have had the ufe of
it long before j though fome imagine that the Chinefe
rather borrowed it from the Europeans.
Flavio de Gioia, a Neapolitan, who lived in the 13th

century, is the perfon ufually fuppofed to have the beft Magnefej
title to the difcovery j and yet Sir G. Wheeler men-
tions, that he had feen a book of aftronomy much old- t
er, which fuppofed the ufe of the needle j though
not as applied to the ufes of navigation, but of aflro-
nomy. And in Guyot de Provins, an old French
poet, who wrote about the year 1180, there is ex-
prefs mention made of the loadlfone and the com¬
pafs, and their ufe in navigation obliquely hinted at.
The Variation of the Magnet, or its declination,

INTRODUCTION.
General Principles.
General i- TF the mineral body called magnet or loadjlone (an
dea of mag- J- ore of iron which will be defcribed under MlNERALO-
aetifm. gy) is brought within a moderate diftance from a piece
of iron or Heel, or other ferruginous body, fuch as a imall
key, a fewing needle, or the like, the ferruginous body
will approach the magnet j and if no obftacle inter¬
vene, wull come in contact with it, and the two bodies
will adhere together, fo as to require an evident force
a to feparate them from each other.
Magnetic Again, if a magnet be freely balanced, fo that it
polarity or be left at liberty to aflume any direflion, as if be fuf-
diretftive pended by a thread, or made to float on the furface of
power. water by placing it on a piece of cork or wood, it wrill
foon fettle itfelf in one particular direction, fo as to
turn one part of its furface towards the northern point
of the horizon, and the oppolite part of courfe towards
the fouthern point. Thefe two parts of the furface of
the magnet are called its north and fouth poles $ this
property of the magnet, of afluming this particular di¬
rection, is called its polarity, or its direclivc power;
and when a magnet is placed fo as to arrange itfelf in
^ fuch a direction, it is faid to traverfe.
Declination The direction in which a fufpended magnet finally
of the mag-fettles is called the magnetic meridian, and it is differ¬
ent in different places, and at different times. It is ge¬
nerally, however, very different from the real meridian
line, fo that the north pole of a magnet declines a little
to the eaft or weft, and the fouth pole to the weft or
eaft. The difference of the magnetic from the aftrono-
mical meridian, is called the declination, or variation of
the magnet ; and the declination is faid to be eaft or
weft, according as the north pole of the magnet verges
to the one or the other of thefe points.
If an oblong magnet be fufpended on a pivot by its
Vol. XII. Part I.
centre of gravity, it does not fettle in a perfectly hori-Dipping of
zontal pofition, but one of its poles is depreffed belowtlie maSnet*
the horizontal line, and the other elevated as far above
it, making an angle with the horizon that is alfo dif¬
ferent on different parts of the earth’s furface. This
depreflion of one of the poles is called the dipping of
the magnet.
If two magnets that are each freely fufpended, be 5
brought within a moderate diftance from each other, fo
that the north pole of the one is oppofed to the fouth
pole of the other, they will attraCl each other ; and if
no obftacle intervene, will rufh together : but if the
two north poles, or the turn fouth poles, be mutually
oppofed, the magnets will repel each other.
Such are the leading properties of what is called the d
natural magnet; but what is of more importance, as
we lhall fee hereafter, any piece of iron or fteel may,
by being rubbed with a natural magnet, or by fome
other proceffes to be afterwards explained, be made to
acquire the fame properties, and thus in every ufeful
refpeCt ferve the fame purpofes as the natural magnet.
Thefe pieces of iron or fteel thus magnetifed, are called
artificial magnets; and when they are of a flender,
oblong form, they are termed magnetic needles. When
afterwards we fpeak of the polarity, the declination, or
the dipping of the magnetic needle, we would be un-
derftood as alluding to thefe flender, oblong, artificial
magnets.
A ftraight line joining the two poles of a magnet is^vlnd
called its axis, and a line drawn tranlverfely on the fur- ‘quator of
face of the magnet, perpendicular to the axis, is called a magnet*
the equator. ^
^ 1 he properties of natural and artificial magnets Magnetic
above enumerated, are attributed to the agency of fome power,
unknown force or power, either inherent in the mag¬
net, or imparted to it by the proceffes to which it is
fubjeefed. I his force is fometimes called magnetifm,
but we (hall for tne prefent denominate it the magnetic

Utility of The molt important property of the magnet is its po-
jnagnetifm. larity, as it is by means of this that the mariner is ena¬
bled, to find his way along the tracklefs ocean, where,
before the difeovery of this important property, he had
no other guide but the ftars, and could therefore fel-
dom venture far from the coaft. It is by this proper¬
ty too, that the miner is enabled to purfue a direct
courfe through the bowels of the earth, or the traveller
direct his Heps through immenfe forefts, or over Tandy
deferts. The ufes of the magnet are therefore obvious
and important, and the fcience w'hich places thefe ufes
in the beft point of view, and thus enables us to turn
them to the greateft advantage, is well deferving our
attention. Many of the fafts to be related under this
article are highly curious, and form a pleafing addition
to thofe fcientific amufements which are fo well calcu¬
lated to excite the attention of beginners in the fludy
I0 of experimental philofophy.
Works on It is unneceflary for us to attempt giving here a hif-
.rr.agnetifm. tory of the origin and progrefsof our knowdedge in mag-
netilm. To a general reader, it would be uninteref-
ting, and to fuch as are better informed, fuperfluous.
We lhall only mention the mod important works that
have appeared on the fubjedl.
Tew7 treatifes^esprefsly on magnetifm have appeared
in fhis country. In the year 1600, Dr Gilbert, a phy-
fician of Colchefter, and the friend of Lord Bacon,
publifhed an excellent work De Magnete et Corporibus
Magveticis, which is ftill perhaps the mod valuable
that we poffefs. Mr Cavallo’s Trcatife on Magnetifm,
fird publidied in 1787, contains a great variety of faffs
and experiments j and a neat compendium of^it is given
in the 3d volume of the fame author’s Elements of Na¬
tural and Experimental Philofophy. Mr Cavallo’s
Treatife, and Mr Adams’s Effay on Magnetifm, form
the fubdance of mod of the compilations on this fubjefl
that have lately appeared.
To thofe wTho wilh to enter minutely on the dudy of
magnetifm, the following lid of foreign publications re¬
commended by the late Profedbr Robifon of Edinburgh

ments made ufe of in magnetical experiments ; in the
fecond we fliall endeavour to arrange under didirnT
heads or propefltions, the leading principles of magne¬
tifm, point out how thefe may be illuflrated by experi¬
ment, and explain the conflrudtion and ides of the mag¬
netical apparatus, as they are deducible from the prin¬
ciples laid down •, and in the third w?e (hall notice the
more important theories of magnetifm, and exemplify
the illudration of feme of the preceding faffs by that
theory which we (hall feel mod difpofed to adopt.

Magnets, as we have faid, are either natural or arti- Magnetn
ficial. The natural magnet may be cut into various
forms, according to the experiments that are to be
made with it. The mod ufual diape is oblong, having
the poles at>the two mod dillant extremities. Dr Gil¬
bert, wdiom we (hall mention more at large hereafter,
made his magnets of a fpherical fhape, fo as to refera¬
ble the terredrial globe. Magnets of this diape are
called terrellce, or little earths, and have ufually mark¬
ed upon their furface the magnetic poles, meridian, and
equator. r3
Natural magnets of an oblong (hape have ufually a Armature
piece of foft iron attached to each pole, called the co«-of magnets.
duElor', and another piece of foft iron placed fo as to
join two of the extremities of the former pieces, and
ufually furnidied with a hook or hole in the middle.
The magnet thus fitted up, as reprefented at fig. 1. is Plate
faid to be armed, and the iron pieces CD, CD, are cal- Aii*
led the armature of the magnet AB. The magnet
with its armature is commonly inclofed in a brafs box,
reprefented in the figure by the dotted lines DC, CC,
CD ; and to the upper part of the box is fixed a ring
E, for holding the magnet.
One of the mod common forms of the artificial mag¬
net is that of an oblong bar, as NS, fig. 2. of which
N is the north pole, and S the fouth, having the north
end marked with a tranfverfe notch. Thefe bars are
made of hardened deel, and are either fold feparately,
or what is more common, in fets of fix in a box.
Another very common form of the artificial magnet
is

bar ; but they are frequently compofed of feveral fuch
bars united together by their flat furfaces, and inclofed
in a leathern covering that envelopes all but the poles,
and thus preferves the bars from rufting.
Inftead of the very arched form of which horfe-flioe
magnets are ufually made, they are fometimes conftruft-
ed fo as to form nearly a femicircle, and in this ihape
thev are very convenient for feveral experiments.
Artificial magnets, like the natural, when of an ob¬
long ihape, are fometimes armed at each end, fo as to
enable them to apply both poles to a ferruginous body
at the fame time. One material advantage of the horfe-
flioe magnet is, that in it fuch an armature is unnecef-
lary, as the poles are brought fo near each other as ea-
fily to be applied to the objetl it is propofed to lift, as
a key, &c.
A magnetic needle is an obkmg piece of fteel, tem¬
pered fo as commonly to aflume the blue tinge that is
feen in watch-fprings, and fupported on a brafs point,
lb as, when left at liberty, to arrange itfelf in the mag¬
netic meridian, but in a horizontal pofition. Thcfe
needles are fometimes made pointed at both extremi¬
ties ; fometiines the northern extremity is made in the
form of a crofs ; but perhaps the bell form is that of the
oblong, with extremities that are nearly obtufe, fuch as
is reprefented at fig. 4. To balance the needle on its
pivot, it is furniflied near its middle with a hollow cap,
which is formed of fome fubftance that is not attra&ed
by the magnet. The cap is ufually of brafs *, but for
nice experiments it is fometimes made of agate, as this
latter does not wear fo faft as brafs, and confequerftly
the needle will longer retain its original fufpenfion.
The dipping needle, fig. 5. confifts of an oblong bar
of Heel, A B, balanced between two horizontal flips of
brafs, CD, CD, fo as when magnetifed to form an
angle with the horizon, equal to the dipping of the
needle at the place where the inftrument is made. The
two horizontal flips of brafs ate either fixed to a gra¬
duated femicircle that is fupported on a ft and of wood,
or more commonly they form diameters to a brafs ring
which is graduated on its circumference, and furnifhed
with a ring H, by which it may be held on tnc
linger.
The conftruflion and ufes of thefe inftruments will be
fully explained in the next chapter; our only, object
here being to bring the reader acquainted with the
•names and general form of the inftruments that are
made ufe of in the experiments which we are about to
deferibe, for illuftrating the principles of magnetifm.
Several fmaller articles will be required by the expe-
rirocntalift : but thefe are eafily procured, and need no
particular defeription. Such are a number of fewitig
needles of various fizes, foft iron bars, pieces of iron
wire, fmall iron balls, iron filings, occ.

nate pofition with refpefl to the aftronomical meridian.tl- ra
This is but a particular cafe of a much more general
fa£t, which may be expreffed by the following propofi-
tion. . 16
\i an oblong piece of iron be fo adjufled, a r to be
libertij to take any pojition ; it will afj'ume a certain de aa(|cter_
terminate direction with rejpeci to the axis of the earth, min^te po~
differing according to the place where the experiment is fitioix
made.
Experiment 1 .—Take a moderately fized ftraight iron
rod, as a piece of iron wire about the thicknefs of a
goofe quill, and about eight or ten inches long ; pafs it
through one extremiry of a large wine cork, fo that it
may be at right angles to the axis of the cork, and ad-
juft it in fuch a manner that it may fwim in water in a
horizontal pofition. Now, provide a pretty large
earthen veflel, as a hand bafon or round deep dilh,
nearly filled with water ; and when the water is free
from agitation, cautioufly put in the wire, in fuch a di¬
rection as not to be very far from the north and fouth
line. The iron rod will, after fome time, be found to
have arranged itfelf fo as, in Britain, to form an angle
with the meridian of about 25 degrees. \
This experiment requires fome nicety, and it will
fometimes be long before the iron aflumes its proper po-
fition ; but if due attention be paid to all the particu¬
lars above mentioned, it will at length arrange itfelf in
the magnetic line. It is neceffary that the rod ftiould
be placed not too far from the magnet'c line, as if it be
laid at right angles to that line, it will never acquire
the proper direction. The fituation of the rod in this
experiment is in the true magnetic line, fo far as re-
fpe£ts the meridian \ but, as it is horizontal, it is not
in the pofition that a magnet would afiume, if freely fuf-
pended by its centre of gravity. An iron rod may,
however, be made to take fuch a pofition, as well as a
magnet.
F.xper. 2.—-Inftead of pafiing the iron rod through
the extremity of a cylindrical or conical piece of cork,
let it be paffed through the centre of a fpherical piece
of cork or wood, fo that the centre of gravity may
coincide with the centre of the fpbere, and let the
whole be of fuch a fpecific gravity as to remain fufpend-
ed in any part of the water, without afeending or def-
cending. If the iron rod thus fitted be placed as in the
laft experiment, it will at length arrange itfelf in the
true magnetic direflion, fo as to make an angle of
about 25 degrees with the meridian, and with one ex¬
tremity depreffed below the horizon at an angle of a-
bout 73 degrees. jy
Thefe experiments were contrived by Dr Gilbert, Polarity of
and fully ftiew that the property of affuming a determi-*ron tempo*’
nate direiflion with refpeft to the earth’s axis is not con-ralT'
fined to magnets, or iron rendered magnetical by the
ufual procefles. There is, however, a remarkable dif¬
ference between the polarity of unmagnetifed iron and
that of natural and artificial magnets. It is of no con-
fequence in the former which extremity be placed to¬
wards the north, or which below the furface of the wa¬
ter, as either will retain the pofition it firfl: acquired,
unlefs difturbed by agitation, or by the proximity of a
magnet; and both extremities may eafily be made to
change fituations. The effect produced on the iron is
therefore temporary. But if a magnetic needle be

freely fufpended, the fame extremity always points to¬
wards the north, and this northern extremity always
dips below the horizon, at lead: in thefe northern lati¬
tudes j and if the polition of the needle be didurbed by
mechanical motion,- or by the application of a magnet,
it will be refumed when the didurbing caufe is removed.
1 he polarity of magnets therefore is permanent.
We have faid that the magnetic line varies at differ¬
ent times, and in different places. The declination of
the magnet is fo uncertain as to impofe great impedi¬
ments to the art of navigation, as it is neceffary, in the
courfe of a long voyage, frequently to afeertain the de¬
gree of variation for any particular time or place. The
method of doing this is mentioned under Compass.
The declination obferved in different places at different
times, has been laid down in tables j and as fuch tables
are very ufeful, we (hall here fubioin one, given by

From this laft table it appears that when the declin¬
ation was firft obferved, the north pole of the magnetic
needle declined to the eaftvvard of the meridian oi Lon¬
don, that fince that time it advanced continually to¬
wards the weft till 1657, when the needle pointed due
north and fouth, and that ever fince it has continually
declined more and more towards the weft, in which di-
redilion it appears to be ftill advancing.
At Paris, in different years, the declination has been
obferved as follows :
101761 - 12- 25
1798
The declination of the magnetic needle has been
found to be different, even at different hours of the day. •
The following table contains the refult of fome observa¬
tions made by Mr Canton on the daily variation, and,
on the mean variation of each month.

r.xpenmen- Charts Irave been conftru£led for ftiewing the decli-
nation of the needle in various parts of the earth by means
of curve lines. Refpefting thefe charts and feveral other
circumifances with regard to this fubjeft, fee Varia¬
tion of the CoTTipafs.
It may not be improper here to point cut the ge¬
neral method of applying the polarity of the magnet to
the ufeful purpofes of navigation, mining, &c.
A mariner’s compafs, or magnetic needle in a cafe, is
fo placed as to be as little as poffible didurbed by the
motion of the veiTel, perfon, &c. In a fliip, it is pla¬
ced in the binnacle (fee Binnacle), or fufpended from
the upper deck in the cabin. Then the head of the
veflel is kept by the helm in fuch a direftion as to make
any required angle with the line of the needle, or
the perfon (in mining or travelling) advances in a
fimilar manner. Thus, fuppoling that a veffel fets out
from a certain part, in order to go to another place
that is exadlly weftward of the former ; as for example,
from the Land’s End in Cornwall to Newfoundland on
'the coaft of North America. The veifel mull be direc¬
ted in fuch a way, as that its courfe may be always at
.right angles with the direftion of the magnetic needle,
or fo that the part of the needle or compafs card,
which points to the northward, (allowing for the varia¬
tion) may be always kept to the right hand of the man
at the helm, or to the (larboard fide of the veffel. The
reafon of this is evident; for, fuppofing the needle to
point duly north and fouth, the diredion of eafi: and
weft being perpendicular to it, this muft be the true
courfe of the veffel. From this example, a little re-
fledion well ealily point out how a veffel rtay be fleered
20 in any other courfe (a.)
Polarity dif- 7 he declination of the magnetic needle is diflurbed by
nirbed by the near approach of a ferruginous body, efpecially if this
be of conjiderable fi%e.
On holding the extremity of a pretty large iron rod,
fuch as a poker, near one end of a magnetic needle pro¬
perly fufpended, the needle will be found to turn con-
i fiderably from its ufual diredion. This circumftance,
though proper to be mentioned here, will be better un-
derftood when we have confidered the attradive power
of the magnet. The fad is ufeful, as it teaches us to
keep magnetic needles in fuch a fituation as not to be
aded on by any confiderable body of iron.
A magnet, whether natural or artificial, has a great-
the ap¬
proach of

er effed in difturbing the polarity of a magnetic needle Experimen-
than is produced by iron. tal Illuftra-
Magnetic polarity feems alfo to be affeded by. ^
changes jn the ftate of the atmofphere ; and the follow-
ing axioms refpeding this effed on the declination of
the needle, colleded by M. la Cotte, are deferving of
attention.
1. The greateft declination of the needle from the
north towards the weft, takes place about two in the
afternoon-; and the greateft approximation of it towards
the north, about eight in the morning ; fo that from
the laft mentioned hour till about two in the afternoon,
it endeavours to remove from the north, and between
two in the afternoon and the next morning, to ap-
proach it.
2. The annual progrefs of the magnetic needle is as
follows :—Between January and March, it removes
from the north ; between March and May it approach¬
es it ; in June it is ftationary ; in July it removes from
it; in Auguft, September, and Odober it approaches
it ; its declination in Odfober is the fame as in May ;
in November and December it removes from the
north ; its greateft weftern declination is at the vernal
equinox, and its greateft approximation to the north,
at the autumnal equinox.
3. The declination of the magnetic needle is differ¬
ent, according to the latitude ; among us, (i. e. in
France) it has always increafed fince 1657; before that
period it was eafterly.
4. Before volcanic eruptions and earthquakes, the
magnetic needle is often fubjed to very extraordinary
movements.
5. The magnetic needle is agitated before and af¬
ter the appearance of the northern lights : its declina¬
tion on thefe occafions is about noon greater than
ufual.
So much has already been faid refpeding the pheno- 21
mena, &c. of the dipping needle, under the article
Dipping Needle, that it is unneceffary here to add
much more on the fubjed. It was there noticed, that
at the equator the dipping needle lies quite horizontal,
and that one of its extremities inclines more towards the
earth, according as the inftrument is carried farther
from the equator. We may here add, that from fome
late obfervations made by experimentalifts with bal¬
loons, it appears that the higher we afeend above the
furface
(a) In-reply to fome inquiries refpeding the mode of employing the compafs in mining, wre were favoured by
tin ingenious friend, who is manager of one of the moft extenfive coalworks in this illand, with the following re¬
marks: “ The compafs is ufed in all mines wdiere great accuracy is required. In fome coal-mines the cleats or
faces of the coal are the guides to the miners in excavating the mine, and the compafs is ufed to afeertain the fi- '
tuation and extent of the excavations. In other coal mines the courfes of the excavaiions are at firft direded by
the compafs. In doing this, the compafs is placed in a given fituation, and is made to point the defired courfe,.
Then from the centre of one fight $ perpendicular line is conveyed to the roof of the mine, and a fmall mark is
there made with chalk; then a perfon loiks at a candle (placed fo as nearly to touch the roof), through the lowrer
part of the fight of the compafs neareft to him, and through the upper part of the oppofite fight. The candle at
the roof is moved in any diredion until he fees it through both fights of the compafs. It is then in a proper place,
and a chalk mark is made in the roof immediately above it. A line (truck with a chalked cord, between thefe
two marks upon the roof, marks the proper courfe, by which the workmen are direded in making the excavation.
By applying one part of a chalked cord along part of the courfe or white line thus begun on the roof, and ex¬
tending the other part of the cord paft it to any required diftance, and then ftriking the cord, the courfe may be
-continued from time to time as the excavation advances.”

Experimen- To wliat vras fa id under Dipping "Needle, refpedling
tai liluftra-condruflion of that inftrument, we may add, that,
^ ^ notwithftanding the great improvements that have been
lately made in the arts, the making of a dipping nee¬
dle is one of the mod delicate and difficult talks that an
inftrument-maker can undertake. The needle mull be
made of tempered fteel which we are certain has no
magnetifm before it is touched j it muft be poifed lo
nicely, and with fuch a perfeft coincidence of its cen¬
tre of gravity and axis of motion, that it will retain any
poiition (before being magnetifed) that is given it A

. Sect. II. On Magnetic Aitraciion and Repuljion.
A magnet A magnet attracts iron, and all bodies, into the com-
' attracts pojition of which iron enters in any confiderable degree.
iron and all prjncjp]e is illullrated by very fimple experiments,
bodies. which will readily occur to every reader. It is of con-
lequence here to obferve, that the purer and fofter the
iron to which the magnet is prefented, the ftronger will
be the attraction ; thus, a magnet attracts a piece of
foft and clean iron much more ftrongly than it attraCls
any other ferruginous body of the lame lhape and
weight. Hard Heel, or the harder ores of iron, are
lefs forcibly attracted than loft Heel, and (till lefs than
foft iron ; and all pieces of iron are lefs forcibly attraCt-
n.2 ed in proportion as they are more oxygenated.
Attraction The aUraCtive power of a mK^net is not equally
greatert at ftrong on eVery part of its furface. It is molt powerful
u P° e=- at. tije p0jes 0f the magnet, and it is found to liminilh
in proportion as the part of the furface is more diltant
from the poles. Thus, in an oblong magnet, the at¬
traction is leait at about its middle, where it is often
23 very trifling.

poleTo/r ab*ed to difeover the poles of a magnet, where they are
magnet. n°t yet afeertained ; a circumftance which is often ne-
ceffary with refpeCt to natural magnets, in which,
when of an irregular lhape, it would othervvife be diffi¬
cult to difeover the poles. The ufual method of afeer-
taining the poles of a magnetic body is, to prefent va¬
rious parts of the body to be examined, fucceffively to
the poles of a magnetic needle, when it will foon be
difeovered which parts of the body have moft influence
•on the needle, by the pole of the latter Handing per¬
pendicularly to that part of the body. It will prefently
apnear, that in this way it may alfo be afeertained
which of thefe poles is the north, and which the fouth,
as the fouth pole of the body under examination will
have mod influence on the north pole of the needle, and
vice verfa.
A good magnet Ihould have no more than two poles,
and thefe ihould be fituated in the extreme furface of
the magnet; but it fometimes happens, efpecially in na¬
tural magnets, and in artificial magnetic bars, if they
be very long, that there are more than two poles, or
that the poles are very confufed. For example, in a
very long magnetifed bar, there may be a itrong north
pole at one extremity, a fouth pole a little farther on,
then a weaker north pole, and fo on to the extremity,
which will be found poiTeffed of a Hill weaker fouth po¬
larity. Thefe poles are to be difeovered by prefenting
to the feveral parts of the bar one or other of the poles

of a magnetic needle; for, as we lhall immediately Expmmen-
mention, each pole of the needle will be attra&e.l to- tal Itiuftra-
wards that part of the rod which is poiieffed of the con- , ^
trary polarity.
The attractive power of the magnet and the iron is
molt forcible when the two bodies are in contaCf, and
it diminiflies as they are made to recede from each
other. The exaCI law according to which this diminu¬
tion takes place, has not yet been completely aicertain-
ed. We ihall fee in the next chapter, what approxi¬
mation has been made to it. 24
A magnet is not capable of lifting above a certain Different
weight of iron ; and all magnets of the fame form and at:tra(ffive
fize are not able to lift the fame weight. Among the
natural magnets the fmalleft feem in general to poffefs 0
a greater attraCfive power in proportion to their fize,
than thofe of larger dimenfions. Mr Cavallo mentions a
fmall magnet that weighed not more than 6 or 7 grains,
and was capable of lifting about 300 grains ; and Sir
Ifaac Newton poiTeffed a magnet that he wore in a ring,
weighing but about 3 grains, which is faid to have lift¬
ed 746 grains, or nearly 250 times its own weight.
The larger natural magnets are very weak in proportion
to thefe. Thofe of two pounds fcarcely lift more than
ten times their own weight. It feems extraordinary,
that a piece cut oil from a large magnet is fometimes
much ftronger in refpeCI of its attractive power, than
the magnet from which it was taken.
It has been laid that the attractive power of magnets
is greatelt at their poles. Both poles, however, are
feldom equal in this refpect; and it appears, that in
thefe northern parts of the world, the north pole of
magnets is more powerful than the fouth. In the fouth-
ern hemifphere the contrary effeCt is faid to take place.
The attractive power of the magnet is moil forcible
when both poles are made to act conjointly; hence an
armed magnet, or one of the horfe-ffioe form, is belt
adapted for experiments- on the force of magnetic at¬
traction.
It is of little confequence whether the iron that is
prefented to the magnet be in one piece, or confift of
feveral pieces. The attraction is indeed ftronger in the
former cafe ; but if feveral pieces of iron are prefented
to the magnet, they will either all adhere about the
pole of the magnet, or will adhere to each other, fo as
to form a fort of chain. If a fmall iron ball be made
to adhere to the pole of a magnet, this ball will fupport
a fecond ; and this latter, if the magnet be pretty
ftrong, w’ill fupport a third. It the magnet be of the
horfe fhoe form, and have thefe three balls hanging by
one ball, if two others be fufpended from the other
pole, all the five may be made to adhere, fo as to form
a curved chain. It will be evident, that pieces of iron
which prefent a greater extent of furface than the above
fpherical balls, will be more powerfully attraded.
One of the moft: pleafing experiments on the attrac-ACtion of a
tion of the magnet for iron, is (hewn by means of iron P3aS5l®f: on

Exper.—Let a paper be placed above a bar magnet,
and let iron filings be fhaken on the paper through a
gaufe fieve. They will arrange themfelves round the
magnet in a very beautiful manner, forming curves and
arches of curves, as reprefented in fig. 6. At the two
ends of the magnet, as a a, there are chains of filings

tal Il'uftra- from the magnet towards its middle, and having their
extremities bounded by the poles of the magnet; and
at the corners there are a number of arches that feem
to form imperfedl curves.
A fimilar effeft may be produced by firewing iron
filings on a piece of paper, fo as to leave a vacancy in
the middle, capable of receiving a bar magnet. When
the magnet is placed on the paper, and the paper gently
tapped, lo as to agitate the filings, thefe wall arrange
themfelves about the magnet, in curves, as above de-
feribed.
b The form of thefe curves will be better defined if the
magnet be laid at the bottom of an earthen or glafs vef-
fel of water, and the iron filings be fitted over it fo as
to pafs through the wrater.
The attraSHon between a magnet and a ferruginous
body is mutual.
Exfier.—Place a piece of iron or other ferruginous
body upon a piece of cork or wTood, fo that it may float
on the furface of w7ater in an earthen or wrooden veffel.
Bring a magnet within a moderate diftance of the float¬
ing bodv, and the latter will approach the former, and
may be drawn by it in any direction. Again, place
the magnet on cork or wood, fo as to float on the wa¬
ter, and prefent to it a piece of iron, or other ferrugi¬
nous body. The magnet wdll now approach the iron,
and may be drawm by it as the iron was before. Laft-
ly, Place both the magnet and the iron on feparate
pieces of wTood or cork, within a moderate diftance of
each other, on the furface of the water. They will
gradually approach each other, with a Velocity that
becomes greater in proportion as they approach neaxer
each other.
Magnetic attrablion is not fenjibly impeded by the rn-
terpo/ition of bodies of any kind, 'that do not contain iron
not fenfibly in their compofition.
kflened by Exper.—Suppofe that a magnet, placed at the dif-
iitioiToT^0- tance an from a P’ece ‘rOT1’ exerts a certain
lKxbes°not degree of attraftion, it will be found that the attraftion
ferruginous, is not fenfibly weakened by the interpofition of a plate
of glafs, a ftieet of paper, a piece of copper, or any
other fimilar fubftance. A needle, inclofed in a glafs
29 globe, will be ftill attracted by the magnet.
Ufual mode It is not eafy to afeertain correftly the degree of at-
ofmeafur- tractive force exerted between a magnet and a ferrugi-
ing die at- nous body. The ufual method of obferving this is, to
faften a magnet to one arm of a balance, and placing
the body to be attracted at different diftances below
the magnet, to counterpoife the attraction with weights
placed in the oppofite fcale of the balance. Proceeding
in this way, then, if w7e find that it requires the weight
of an ounce to counterpoife the attractive pow'er of a
magnet, w’hen prefented immediately to a piece of iron,
it will be found that it requires the fame counterpoife,
if a plate of any matter that is not ferruginous be in-
terpofed.
Not only is iron attracted by the magnet, but under
certain circumflances, one piece of iron exerts an attrac¬
tive power on another piece of iron.
Exper.—Let an oblong piece of iron be fixed in a
fpherical piece of wood or cork, fo as to float in water
in the true magnetic line, as in Exper. 2. of N“ 16.

an inch of the upper extremity of the floating iron, and
hold it there for fome time, a little towards one fide.
The floating wire will gradually approach the iron rod
with an accelerated motion, will at length touch it, and
may be drawn through the water in any direction. A
fimilar attraction will take place between the head of
the poker and the extremity of the wire that is below
the water. 31
The attractive power of the magnet is increafed by the Magnetic

capable of fupporting a fmall key by one of its extremi¬
ties, but which wall not lift a key fomewhat larger. If
we bring a confiderable oblong piece of iron near the
oppofite extremity of the bar, it wall be found ca¬
pable of fupporting the larger key, or at leaft of
lifting a W'eight fomewhat greater than it fuftained be¬
fore.
Exper. 2.—Let an oblong magnetic bar be fupported
in a horizontal pofition, and let a piece of iron ware,
about an inch in length, be hung by a Ihort thread, fo
that its extremity is juft oppofite one of the poles of the
magnetic bar, but fo far out of the reach of the bar’s
attractive power as not to be brought from the perpen¬
dicular. Now, if a confiderable iron bar be brought
with one end within a moderate diftance of the oppohte
pole of the magnet, the fufpended wire will be drawn
towards the magnet, thus (hewing that the powTer of the
latter has been increafed by the juxtapofition of the
bar of iron. If the bar of iron be brought ftill nearer
the oppofite pole of the magnet, the fufpended wire will
be drawn ftill nearer its adjacent pole $ but if the bar
of iron be drawn back from the magnet, the wire wdll
fall into its original pofition.
This fad leads to many important praClical conciu-
fions in the management of magnets. As the juxta¬
pofition of iron to the poles of a magnet improves its
powers, we may infer, that if we keep a piece of foft
iron in contaCl with the poles, the magnet will be im¬
proved by it and this is in fad the cafe, and it (hews
the utility of the armature and conduClor mentioned in
N® 13. But of this more hereafter. ^
The attraBive power of a magnet may be improved by power of a
increafng the weight appended to it. magnet in-
This is beft ftiown by a horfe-ftioe magnet, having acrea^dby
conduClor of foft iron attached to its two poles, and a le
brafs ring at the convex part by which it may be fuf- it. 0
pended. If a fmall bag be hung to the conduClor, and
if the magnet is capable of containing a certain weight
at any particular time, it will, by adding a little more,
fuppofe a few7 (hot, to the bag, at moderate intervals,
be made to fupport gradually a much greater weight.
If the magnet, on a firft trial, was able to lift a fmall
key, it w7ill foon be able to lift a larger one, &c. How
far this increafe of pow7er may be carried, has not, we
believe, yet been afeertained.
It fometimes happens tfyat a magnet does not (hewr
any great attraClive power, as exemplified in its power
of lifting a confiderable weight of iron, though it may
have a great effeCl in exciting or in altering magnetic
polarity. This was obferved by Dr Gilbert, who re-

i .. ^’ , The contrary poles, of two magnets attraB each other ;
that is, the north the fouth, and vice verfa.
Exper. i.—Place two oblong magnets on cork or
wood, fo as to float in water, or fufpend each by a
pretty long thread, with the north pole of the one op-
pofed to the fouth pole of the other. They will gra¬
dually approach, and will at length ruflr together.
A fimilar effedl will be produced, if the north pole
of a bar magnet be held near the fouth pole of a mag¬
netic needle •, the latter will be attracted, and the fame
thing will happen if the fouth pole of the bar is brought
near the north pole of the needle.
Exper. 2.—Take two femicircular magnets, and dip
their extremities into iron filings. The filings will of
Courfe adhere to the extremities of the magnets, and
will appear as if radiating from them. Now, prefent
the two magnets with their adhering filings to each
other, fo that the north and fouth pole of the one is
oppofite to the contrary poles of the other, and the iron
filings at their extremities will approach each other,
and coalefce, as reprefented in fig. 7.
The attraction exerted between two magnets is not
fo ftrong in proportion, as between a magnet and a
piece of foft iron in contacty but it has been found to
34 commence at a greater diftance.
Correfpond- The correfponding poles of two magnets repel each
other; that is, the north the north, and the fouth the
fouth.
Exper. 1.—Make the two magnets float on w^ater, or
fufpend them by threads, fo that the north or fouth
pole of the one may be oppofite to the north or fouth
pole of the other. They will recede from each other,
and the repuliion will evidently be greater, in propor¬
tion as they are brought nearer together.
Exper. 2.—l ake two femicircular magnets, and dip
their ends in iron filings, as mentioned above. Prefent
them to each other, fo that their correfponding poles
may be mutually oppofed. The filings at their extre¬
mities will Aart back, and leave a vacancy between the
oppofed poles of the magnets, fomewhat like what is
reprefented in fig. 8.
It fometimes happens that the correfponding poles of
two magnets do not repel each other, but either mu¬
tually attrad, or are quite indifferent. In this cafe, it
will, in general, be found that one of them is ftronger
than the other ; and the reafon of the phenomenon will
appear hereafter.
The repulfive power of a magnet is generally in a
lefs proportion than its attradive power.
It is by the attradive powrer of the magnet that we
ufually afeertain whether any lubftance be magnetic ;
that is, whether the magnet polfefs any attradive powTer
for it. If the body contain any confiderable quantity
of ir n in its compofition, its magnetifm is eafily afeer-
tained, by approaching it with the pole of a pretty
ftrong magnetic bar. If, however, the magnetifm is
too feeble to be difeovered in this way, it may be af-
certained by placing the body on a piece of cork or
wood, fo that it may float on the furface of water or
mercury, in an earthen or wooden veffel, and bringing
the pole of the magnet within a fmall diflance of the
floating body. It will fometimes be neceffary to bring

the magnet within one-tenth of an inch of the body, Exprrimen-
when, if it poflelfes any magnetifm, it will graduallyta^
approach the magnet. This experiment is theft fatis- tions' .
fadfory when the body to be examined is made to float
on mercury ; but in that cafe the vefiel containing the
mercury mull not be too Imall, otherwife the natural
convexity of the furface of the mercury will caufe the
floating body perpetually to fall down towards the fides
of the veflel. A common foup plate will anfwer the
purpofe very well. It is alfo neceffary that the mer¬
cury be very pure, and as clean as poflible. To infure
this, it will be proper, before ufing the mercury, to
pafs it through a conical piece of writing paper, rolled
up fo as to terminate in a very fmall aperture $ or what
is better, to fqueeze it through a pretty thick piece of
fhamois leather. It need fcarcely be remarked, that in
thefe delicate experiments, the air of the room fliould
be kept as Hill as poflible.
By the above methods, Mr Cavallo and others dif¬
eovered, that the following fubftances are in fome mea-
fure affefted by the magnet. Moft metallic ores, efpe-
cially after their having been expofed to a fire; zinc,
bifmuth, and particularly cobalt, as well as their ores,
are almoft always attra£!ed. Of the earths, the calca¬
reous is the leaft, if at all, and the liliceous is the moft
frequently, attracled. The ruby, the chryfolite and
the tourmalin, are attrafled. The emerald, and parti¬
cularly the garnet, are not only attracted, but frequent¬
ly acquire a permanent polarity. The opal is weakly
attracted, efpecially after combuftion. Molt animal
and vegetable fubftances, after combuflion, are attract¬
ed. Even foot, and the duft which ufually falls upon
whatever is left expofed to the atmofphere, are fenlibly
attrafted by the magnet.
“ It has long ago been remarked, that platina, nickel, Coulomb’s
and feveral other bodies, acquire a fenfible degree of experiments

perty only to a portion of iron not eafy to be feparated,^ai. magne*
and conclude, that by obtaining a greater degree of
purity, we might fucceed in rendering them perfectly
indifterent to the aCtion of the magnetic bar.
“ The new experiments which Citizen Coulomb has
made and repeated before the inftitute, lead us on the
contrary to think, that the aftion of magnetifm ex¬
tends through all nature ; for none of the bodies he has
yet tried was found to refill this power.
“ But howrever real this adlion may be, it is not
alike in all bodies, and in moft of them it muft be ne-
ceffarily very fmall, to have efcaped the attention of
philofophers to this time. In order, therefore, to exhi¬
bit and to meafure thefe refults, we muft begin by pla¬
cing the bodies in a lituation which ftiall allow them to
yield to the wTeakert aCtion.
“ For this purpofe, Citizen Coulomb fafhioned his
fubjeCls into the form of a cylinder or fmall bar ; and
in this ftate he fufpended them to a lilken thread, fuch
as is drawn from the filk worm’s cone, and in this ftate
he placed them between the oppofite poles of two mag¬
netic bars of fteel. The fingle thread of filk could
hardly bear the weight of a quarter of an ounce without
breaking, c@nfequently it became neceffary to form
fmall bars very light and thin. Citizen Coulomb made
them about feven or eight millimetres in length (or lefs
than half an inch), with three-fourths of a millimetre
for

Experimen-(or about an hundredth part of an inch) in thicknefs,
tal Illuftra- an(j grave jhe metals about one-third of this thick-
■ tl0;s- .nefs.
“ In his experiments he placed the fteel bars in the
fame right line, their oppofite poles being five or fix
millimetres farther afunder than the length of the
needle intended to ofcillate between them. The refult
of the experiment {hewed, that whatever might be the
fubftance of the needle, it always difpofed itfelf accord¬
ing to the dire£Hon of the two bars •, and that if they
were turned from this direction, they always recovered
it, after ofcillations of which the number was often
more than 30 per minute. It was therefore eafy in
every cafe to determine, from the weight and figure of
the needle, the force which had produced the ofcilla-
tion.
“ Thefe experiments were fuccefsfully made with
fmall needles of gold, filver, copper, lead, tin, fmall
cylinders of glafs, a piece of chalk, a fragment of bone,
and different kinds of wood.
“ Citizen Coulomb has proved, that the force of tor-
fion of the filk thread is fo flight, that in order to draw
it round the entire circle, it would require a force
fcarcely equal to the one hundred thoufandth part of a
gramm, (or about one feven hundredth part of a grain).
A quantity fo minute cannot therefore fenfibly derange
the meafure of magnetic force in the different bodies j
and its effect, even ii it wrere admitted to be of percep¬
tible magnitude, may alfo be urged in proof of the ge¬
neral conclufion of Citizen Coulomb, becaufe the mag¬
netic power muft overcome this refiftance of the thread
in order to manifeft itfelf. Our author gives, in the
third volume of the Memoirs of Natural Philofophy and
Mathematics of the National Inftitute, a very Ample
formula to determine the magnetic force of a body from
the time of its ofcillations *, and he means to fliew in
another memoir, the method of determining this refult
in different bodies of the fame figure placed between
the poles of two bars. He thinks it now proved, that
all the elements which enter into the compofition of
our globe are fubjefted to the magnetic power, and
that the whole mafs colle&ively forms’ one Angle
magnet.
“ Li favour of thofe who might be defirous of repeat¬
ing his experiments, and rendering them very fenfible,
the author remarks, that the method of fucceeding con-
fifis in diminifliing the fize of the ofciilating bodies.
From fome effays, of which the refults terminate this
memoir, it feems to follow, that the accelerating forces
are inverfely as the maffes, or very nearly in the diredt
proportion of the furfaces; but Citizen Coulomb gives
this rule only as a firft dedudtion, which requires to be

mufl be kept faft by a circular rim of pafteboard, that
the needle may not rife off its pivot, in the fame man¬
ner as in the cornpafs. This tube will thus become a
kind of compafs fufficiently tranfparent to ftiow the mo¬
tions of the needle. The eye-glafs ferves more clearly
to diftinguiih the diredion of the needle, and the glafs
at the other end, merely to give the tube the appear¬
ance of a common petfpedive glafs. It will appear,
from what has been already ftated, that the needle in
this tube, when placed over and at a fmall diflance
from a magnet, or any machine in which, it is contain¬
ed, will neceffarily place itfelf in a pofition direded by
that magnet, and confequently fliow where the north
and fouth pole of it is placed ; the north end of the
needle conftantly pointing to the fouth end of the mag¬
net. This effed will take place, though the magnet
be enclofed in a’ cafe of wood, or even metal. You
mufl: obferve, however, that the attrading magnet muft
not be very far diftant from the needle, efpecially if it
be fmall, as in that cafe its influence extends but to a
ftiort diflance. This tube may be differently conftrud-
ed, by placing the needle in a perpendicular diredion,
on a fmall axis of iron, on which it muft turn quite
freely, between two fmall plates of brafs placed on
each fide of the tube ; the twa ends of the needle
fliculd be in exad equilibrium. The north and fouth
ends of the needle will, in like manner, be attraded by
the fouth and north ends of the- magnetic bar. The
former conftrudion, however, appears preferable, as it
is more eafily excited, and the fituation of the needle
much more eafily diflinguiflied.

under the table, which you pull out to fhew that there
is nothing concealed. At one end of the table there
mud be a pin that communicates with the magnet, and
by which it may be placed in different pofitions ; this
pin muft be fo placed as not to be vifible to the fpe£la-
tors. Strew fome fteel filings or very fmall nails over
that part of the table where the magnet is. Then alk
any one to .1* nd you a knife or a key, which will then
attraft part of the nails or filings. Then placing your
hand in a carelefs manner on the pin at the end of the
table, you alter the pofition of Ae magnet, and giving
the key to any perfon, you defire him to make the ex¬
periment, which he will then not be able to perform.
You then give the key to another perfon, at the fame
tfme placing the magnet, by means of the pin, in the
firft poiition, when that perfon will immediately perform
the experiment.

Exp. 3. The hhjJlcrious Watch.
Myfterxons You defire any one in company who has a watch
atcdl' with a fteel balance, (b) to lend it you for a few mi¬
nutes, a Iking him whether it will continue to go when
laid on the table. <He will probably fay it will. To
prove to him that he is wrong, you lay it on that part
of the table below wdiich you have previoufiy placed
a ftrong bar-magnet (as in Exp. 2.), fo that the watch
may be above mre of the poles. It will immediately
flop. Now, if you ftiift the pofition of the magnet,
and give the w'atch to another perfon to lay it on the
table, it will not ftop, but replacing the magnet, and
defiring a third perfon to try the experiment, he will
fucceed. All this, to thofe who are not acquainted
with the fecret, will appear very extraordinary.
Exp. 4. The Magnetic Dial.
Provide a circle of wood or ivory,, of about five or
fix inches diameter, as fig. 10. which muft turn quite
free on the Hand JB (fig. 11.), in the circular border
A : on the circle muft be placed the dial of pafteboard
C (fig. 10.), whole circumference is to be divided into
12 equal parts, in which muft be inferibed the numbers
from 1 to 1 2, as on a common dial. There muft be a
fmall groove in the circular frame D, to receive the

pafteboaid circle j and obferve that the dial muft be Experimen-
made to turn fo freely that it may go round withouttal illuftra-
moving the circular border in which it is placed. Be- t‘ons-
tween the pafteboard circle and the bottom of the v
frame, place a imall artmcial magnet E (fig. 12.)
that has a hole in its middle, or a fmall protuberance.
On the outfide of the frame place a fmall pin P, which
ferves to ftiew where the magnetic needle I, that is
placed on a pivot at the centre of the dial, is to ftop.
I his needle muft; turn quite freely on its pivot, and its
two fides fliould be in exadt equilibrium. Then pro¬
vide^ fmall bag, that has five or fix divifions, like a
lady's work-bag, but fmaller. In one of thefe divifions
put Imall iquare pieces of pafteboard on which are writ¬
ten the numbers from 1 to 12, and if you pleafe you may
put feveral of each number. In each of the other divifions
you muft put 12 or more like pieces, obferving, that all
the pieces in each divifion muft be marked with the fame
number. Now the needle being placed upon its pivot,
and turned quickly about, it wfill necefiarily ftop at that
point where the north end of the magnetic bar is
placed, and which you previoufly knew by the fituation
or the fmall pin in the circular border. You therefore
prefent to any perfon that divifion of the bag which
contains the feveral pieces on which is written the num¬
ber oppofite to the north end of the bar, and tell him
to draw any one of them he pleafes. Then placing the
needle on the pivot, you turn it quickly about, and it
will neceflarily ftop, as w>e have already faid, at that
particular number.
_ Another experiment may be made with the fame
dial, by defiring two perfons to draw each of them one
number out of twxi different divifions of the bag ; and
if their numbers, when added together, exceed 1 2, the
needle or index will ftop at the number they exceed it;
but if they do not amount to 1 2, the index will ftop at
the fnm of thofe two numbers. In order to perform
this experiment, you muft place the pin again!! the
number 5, if the two numbers to be drawn from the
bag be 10 and 7 5 or againft 9, if they be feven and
two. If this experiment be made immediately after
the former, as it eafily may, by dexteroufly moving the
pin, it will appear the more extraordinary.

Iron be-

to a mag¬

The whole of this important part of the fubjeft may
be faid to depend on one general fact, which we fliall
therefore firft lay down and illuflrate.
udny piece of iron when in the neghbovrhood of a mag-
comes mag- net iiflf a magnet, and poffelfes all the material pro-
Tw ' . l 17 1 J. v
perties oj that body.
Ex. i. Let there be a large and ftrong magnet pro¬
perly fupported in the horizontal diredtion, at a diftance
from iron or other fimilar bodies, and with its poles per-
fedtly free. Take alfo any fmall piece of common iron,
not more than two or three inches long, fuch as a com¬
mon fmall key, and take another piece of iron, as a
fmaller key, or Ihort piece of wire about the fize of a
goofe quill.
In the firft place hold the key in a horizontal pofi-
tion, with one end oppofite one of the poles of the mag¬
net, but fo as not to be in contadl with it. Then bring
the other piece of iron to the other end of the key, and
it will hang by the key, and will fo continue to hang,
though we withdraw the key from the magnet horizon
tally, till there is a certain interval between the key
and the magnet, when the former will be no longer
able to fupport the piece of iron. Even at this diftance
the key will, however, be found capable of fuppovting
a piece of iron confiderably fmaller than the former,
till its diftance from the magnet be increafed.
Again, hold the key with one extremity below one
of the poles of the magnet, and touch the other extre¬
mity-with the fmall piece of iron, the latter will ad¬
here till the key be removed too far below the magnet.
Thirdly, Hold the key with one of its extremities
above one of the poles of the magnet, but at fuch a
diftance that there is room for the fmall piece of iron
to go between the key and the magnet, without touch¬
ing the latter. The piece of iron will be fupported by
the key, as in the two former inftances.
Fourthly, Let the magnet be placed in a vertical po-
fition, and hold the key with one extremity immedi¬
ately below or above one of the poles. The piece of
iron will be fupported in a fimilar manner, in the form¬
er cafe by the extremity of the key that ss moft remote
from the magnet, and in the latter by that which is ad¬
jacent.
If, inftead of approaching the magnet with the key,
we reverfe the circumftances, the effedl of the magnet
in rendering the key magnetical will be ftill more evi¬
dent. Suppofe the piece of iron to be lying on the
table ; let one end of it be touched with the key, and
there will be found ho attradlion between them : but if
while we hold the key very near one extremity of the
wire, we bring the pole of the magnet near the ether
E T 1 S M. 373
end of the key, we ftiall fee the wire rife from the Expenmen-
table, and adhere to the key. ta t:0 , '
In all thefe cafes the attractive power of the key,
that is, its magnetifm, is evidently derived from its
juxtapofition to the magnet.
Exp 2. Let two pieces of iron wire be fufpended by
feparate ends of a piece of thread, fo that they may be
hung from a pin in the wall in a fituation parallel to
each other, or in contact. Now bring one end of a
bar magnet a little below the wires, and they will re¬
pel each other. If thefe wires are of foft iron, they
will collapfe immediately on the magnet being with¬
drawn 5 but if they are formed of hard iron or of iteel,
they ivill continue apart for a confiderable time.
Here the two wires are, by the proximity of the
magnet, become magnets, and the extremities next the
bar have each acquired a fimilar polarity, i. e. both
contrary to that of the adjacent pole of the bar. They,
therefore, repel each ether.
Exp. 3. Let a bar-magnet, fuch as N, S, fig. 14,
be laid in a horizontal pofition, and let a fmall key, as
B, C, be held near the north pole of the magnet, in
the dire&ion of its axis. Let a very fmall magnetic
needle, fupported on a fharp pivot, be brought near that
end of the key C, which is moft remote from N. The
needle will immediately turn its fouth pole towards C,
as is indicated by the feathered part of the arrow c.
Hence it appears that the key has acquired a diredive
power like a magnet, and that its remote extremity
performs the office of a north pole, as it attrads the
fouth pole of the needle, and repels its north pole. If
it be faid that the magnetic needle in this cafe is affed-
ed diredly by the diredive power of the magnet, as it
would take the above pofition though the key were not
prefent ; to ihew that the effed is produced through
the medium of the key, remove the needle into another
fituation as /?, and it will ftill arrange itfelf with the
fame pole oppofite C, and if it be carried to the prox¬
imate extremity of the key, as at a, it will turn round,
and prefent its north pole to B, thus (hewing that it is, .
at lead in iome meafure, influenced by the key. . ^
In general, when a piece of iron is prefented to the Nearelt end'-
pole of a magnet, the extremity next that pole is pof- acquires a
feffed of the contrary polarity, and the remote extremi- P0’ianty
ty has acquired a fimilar polarity. The fituation
the poles, however, depends much on the form of the adjacent
piece of iron, and on the part of its furface which is pole of the
prefented to the pole of the magnet. If the form be iaagnet-
that of an oblong bar, one extremity of ivhich is pre¬
fented to the pole, which is the moft ufual cafe, the
circumftanccs will be as we have juft mentioned. If
the oblong bar be prefented to the pole in a perpendi¬
cular diredion, with its middle very near the pole of
the magnet, tins middle point will be pofieffed of a po¬
larity contrary to that of the adjacent pole, while the
twro extremities have acquired the fame polarity. It
the prefented iron be in the form of a circular plate, .
and its centre be held near the pole of the magnet,
this centre will have the contrary polarity, and every
point of the circumference the fame polarity. If the
plate have its circumference faftiioned into points, each
of thefe points wall acquire a very ftrong polarity, con¬
trary to that of the pole near which the centre of the
plate is held.
The communication of magnetic power from the
mavnet
"374-
Experimen-magnet to the key in the foregoing experiments, will
tai Illuftra- fljjj ftrongly illuftrated by holding another
■ "'^2' . piece of wire to the wire that is already fufpended by
the key. The new piece of wire will alfo be fufpend¬
ed, and fo feveral more may be fufpended by one ano¬
ther, like the links of a chain, according to the ftrength
of the magnet. This fa£l was known to the ancients,
who fpeak of a loadllone caufing an iron ring to carry
another ring ; and that a third, till the whole puts on
46 the appearance of a chain.
Induced It will be found that the magnet has loft none of its
magnetifm. p0wer by producing magnetifm in the iron, and of
courfe, that nothing has been transferred from the
magnet to the iron. The magnetifm of the iron thus
caufed by its juxtapofition to a magnet is called induced
47 magnetifm, or magnetifm bij indued ion.
Apparent There is an apparent exception to the umverfality of
exception, propolition. If the key be held in fuch a
pofiticn as that it ftiall be perpendicular to the magnet,
•with one extremity either oppofite one of the poles, or
a little above the centre of the magnet, the bit of wire
v ivill not be attracted by that extremity, and we may
hence fuppofe that the key has acquired no magnetic
powrer by its proximity to the magnet. But if we‘bring
a needle or a piece of iron wire near its remote end, it
will be ftrongly attracted, and fhew that end to have
the fame polarity with the neareft pole of the magnet.
Now, the ends both of the key and the wire that are
next the magnet, having the fame polarity with the pole
of the magnet neareft them, cannot attraft each other,
but on the contrary will repel each other, and there¬
fore the wire cannot adhere to the key, though by the
change produced by the other extremity, it is evident
4S that the key has acquired magnetic power.
Real ex- There is, however, one exception. If the key in the
ception. fjj.fi- experiment, with the wdre hanging to it, be carried
from any of the fituations there deferibed, tow-ards the
middle of the magnet, the wire will fall oft' as foon as it
arrives very near the middle. If we fuppofe a plane to
pafs through the centre of the magnet in a direction
perpendicular to its axis, fo as to form the magnetic
equator, a fender piece of iron held any where within
this plane can acquire no fenftble magnetifm, which is
demonftrated by its (hewing nofigns of polarity, and not
being attracted by the magnet. Now it is well known
that the greateft aflivity of a magnet refides in its two
poles, and that thofe magnets are the beft in which
this aclivity is leaft diffufed. A certain circumference
of every magnet is entirely inactive, as we fee in the
experiment with the iron filings deferibed in N° 26.
.where the filings collefl: themfelves principally on two
points of the furface, between which there is a fpace all
- round, to which no filings are attached. Many cir-
cumftances fhew that the two poles of a magnet have
.contrary eftions-, the north pole producing a ftrong
northern polarity in the remote end of an iron bar
brought near it, and a fouth polarity in the proximate
end, while an oppofite effeft is produced by its fouth
pole. Now, adopting this principle, that the aftiens of
the two poles are oppefite, it follows that if thefe actions
are equal, and a£t in a fimilar manner, each muft coun¬
teract and prevent the action of the other, and pro¬
duce what may be called a magnetic equilibrium.
Therefore if a fender iron rod or thin plate be placed
- fo- that every part of it lies within the magnetic equator,
1
Chap. II.
it svill exhibit no magnetifm, will not be attracted by Experimen-
the magnet, and will not attraft iron. This will betai Eluftra-
feen more fatisfaftorily when we have explained the . L~ ^ .
theory of magnetifm.
The confideration of the above important fa£ts will
enable us to explain, efpecially after what will be
ftated in the next chapter, the production or communi¬
cation of magnetifm in all the methods by which thefe
are ufually elfeCted. ■ 4^
Magnetifm may be produced artificially in a piece of^h^iat
iron or feel, by various methods. magnetUm

magnet, or with a feel bar already magnetized. By touch-
The procefs of communicating magnetifm by na- ^ng with a
tural or artificial magnets, or by what has been called ma£net‘
touching, has undergone various improvements and mo¬
difications, which we (hall endeavour briefly to trace.
The moft fimple method of magnetizing a bar of old me-
fteel is to apply the north pole of a magnet to that ex-thods.
tremity of the bar which we wiih to acquire a fouth po¬
larity. In this way, merely by contadf, a flight degree
of magnetic power will, after forae time, be imparted to
the bar, and the communication will be expedited by
ftriking the bar fo as to make it found. Only a flight
degree of magnetifm can, however, be communicated in
this way, and unlefs the fteel bar be very (hort, its poles
will be much confufed.
Another method ©f communicating magnetifm to a
bar of this kind is, to apply the pole of a magnet to one
end of the bar, and pafs it on to the other end, giving
a moderate degree of preffure. This is repeated feveral
times on both Aides of the bar, taking care always to
begin the ftroke at the fame end as at firft, and inftead
of drawing the magnet back along the bar, lifting it up
every time that we come to the other end. The fol¬
lowing defeription wall beft explain the mode of com¬
municating magnetifm in this way, by one or two mag¬
netic bars.
When only one magnetic bar is to be made ufe of,
one of its poles muft be applied as reprefented fig. 15.
where CD reprefents the needle or fteel bar to be im¬
pregnated. The magnet A B is then to be drawn all
along the furface of it, till it reaches the extremity D.
The magnet being then removed, muft be applied to
the extremity C, and drawn over the needle as before.
Thus the needle muft be rubbed feveral times, by
which means it will acquire a confiderable degree of
raagnetifm. In this method, the other extremity of
the needle which the magnet touched laft acquires the
contrary magnetifm •, that is, if B be the north pole of
the magnet, C will be the north pole and D the fouth
of the needle. This method, however, is never found
to be equally effectual with that in which two magnets,
or both poles of one magnet, are made ufe of.
To communicate magnetifm by means of two mag¬
netic bars, place the bar or needle AB, fig. 16. upon a
table; then fet the two magnetic bars CD, EF,
ftrdigbt upright upon it at a little diftance, equal on
both fides from the middle of the bar AB, and in fuch
a manner that the fouth pole D of one of the bars may
be neareft to that end of the bar AB which is to be¬
come the north pole, &c. Thefe two bars muft then
be Aid gradually towards one extremity of the bar,
keeping them conflantly at the fame diftance from each
other j and when one of them, for inftar.ee CD, is ar¬
rived
M A G N E T I S M.
Chap. II.
Experimen-rived at A, then they muft be flid tne contrary way,
tal Illuftra-£ip ;irnVes at B ; and thus the bar AB mud be
. tlons- , rubbed a greater or fmaller number of times, till it
v wiH be found by trial to have acquired a confiderable
power. When the magnetic bars are powerful, and
the bar AB of very good Heel, and not very large, a
dozen of ftrok.es are fully fufHcient •, but when the bars
are to be removed from the bar A.B, care muft be taken
to bring them to the fame fituution where they were
firft placed ; viz. a little and equal dittance frorn the
middle of the bar AB, from which they may be lilted
up.
The mode of employing two bars inftead of one was
an improvement, and the raetnod was ftill farther im¬
proved by placing them in an inclined poution, with
their extremities C, E, remote from each otner, and
Hiding them contraryways from the middle towards
each extremity of the bar AB, lifting them up when
they come to the extremities, and replacing them on
the middle of the bar, thus repeating the operation as
often as required.
IVetu ‘ of Horfe-fhoe bars, or thofe of a femicircular form, may be
Kuching magnetized in a fimilar manner, except that the mag-
ci rved bars. j-,ar3 employed for the purpole muft follow the
curvature of the bar to be impregnated. The follow¬
ing is the method ulually employed for magnetizing
bars of this kind. The crooked bar is laid ftat upon a
table, and to each of its extremities is applied a ftraight
magnetic bar, as DF, EG, fag. 17. and the remote ex¬
tremities of thefe bars F, G, are joined by the conductor
or piece of foft iron EG. Then to its middle are to be
applied two magnetic bars, with their oupofite poles at
a little diftance from each other, H, I, and with thefe
the crooked bar is to be ftroked from end to end, fol¬
lowing the direftion of the crooked bar, fo that on one
fide of it the magnetic bars may ftand in the dire&ion
reprefented by the dotted lines at K and L. When in
this manner the piece of fteel ABC has been rubbed
a fufficient number of times on the one fide, it is to be
turned, and the fame operation repeated on the other fide,
taking care that the adhering magnetic bars, and the
conduftor of foft iron, be preferved in the fame fituation
as at firft. It muft be obferved that in this procels t^e
magnets DF,DG, as well as the magnets H,I, muft be
placed fo that their fouth poles (hall be towards that ex-
S3 tremity of the bar which is to be made a north pole.
Duhamel’s A material improvement in tne prcceis (or communi-
improve- cating magnetil'm from artificial magnets to fteel bars,
was introduced by Duhamel. He formed a right-
angled parallelogram, two of the fides of which were
made by two equal bars of fteel, that were intended to
be magnetized, while the ether two were formed by
joining the extremities of the fteel bars by two pieces oi
foft iron, alfo equal to each other in length, but much
(horter than the fteel bars. Then taking two parcels of
bars already magnetized, he brought togetner their op-
pefite poles towards the middle of one of the fteel bars
forming the parallelogram, and inclining the parcels as
in fig. 18. he made them glide gently, feparating them
from each other towards the extremities of the bar j
and this operation was repeated as often as required,
when the inclined parcels of magnetic bars were car¬
ried to the oppofite bars of the parallelogram, and this
was rubbed in a fimilar manner. After the bars were
375
rubbed fufficient]y on one fide, they were, as in xomer Exp^iraen-
cafes, turned on the other. U1 t;0^s_5®r
This method is one of the beft that we can employ u—<
for magnetizing the needles of compafles, and iuch
fteel bars as are of a moderate thinnefs, efpeciaily it we
employ magnetic bars ftrongly impregnated for the pnr-
pofe of rubbing the fteel bars.
Much about the time that M. Duhamel contrived
the above method, the fame object was employing thementby
attention of experimental philofophers in England, Mitchell
where the procefs of magnetizing bars was much im-anc^anton’
proved by Mr Mitchell and Mr Canton.
Mr Mitchell employed two parcels of bars already
ftrongly magnetized, joined together in a parallel di-
redlion, with their oppofite poles united at each extre¬
mity, but in fuch a manner, that there remained be¬
tween the two parcels a fmall interval. He then
placed a number of equal fteel bars in a ftraight line,
and made one extremity of the magnetized bars
Hide over the line formed by the fteel bars at right
angles j and this he repeated as ufual. In this way he
found that the intermediate bars in the ftraight line ac¬
quired a great degree of magnetic power.
Mr Canton placed the bar which he wiftied to mag¬
netize, fo as to form part of a parallelogram, as in the
method of M. Duhamel, and then employed the fame
means as Mr Mitchell for impregnating the bar, after
which he feparated the two parcels oi magnets, and in¬
clining them to each other in the manner of Duhamel
upon the bar, he made them Hide from the needle to¬
wards the extremities. This laft method confiderably
augmented, according to Mr Canton, the magnetic
power of the bar ; but by Coulomb it is confidered as
the only effcclual part of the procefs. Thefe methods
of Mitchell and Canton conftitute what has been called
the double touch, which was ftill farther improved by
the celebrated Aipinus. c „
This philofopher, after having formed a parallelo- Method of
gram with fteel bars, and pieces of foft iron, in the man-iEpinus.
ner of Duhamel, placed upon the bar to be magne¬
tized, two parcels of magnetic bars inclined in fuch a
way that each of them formed on its own fide an angle
of 150 or 20° with the fteel bar on which it was placed j
their oppofite poles being at a very fmall diftance from
one another. Keeping the parcels of magnetic bars in
the fame relative lituation with refpeeft to each other,
he made both parcels Hide along alternately from the
middle of the bar towards each extremity, beginning at
every renewal of the dperation from the middle 01“ the
bar. This method has a very great advantage over the
former, as by it we may magnetize bars of confiderable
length and thicknefs, by means of magnetic bars that
have no great magnetic power.
In all thefe proceffes it muft be remarked, that, in 5°
order to proceed properly, it is neceffary to employ a temai J'
confiderable degree of preffure. A parallelogram of fteel
bars and foft iron ftiould be kept firm by wedges, fome-
what in the manner of printers types, and the extremi¬
ties of the magnetic bars ftiould be perfeftly cleaned.
Dr Robifon fuppofed, that wetting thefe extremities
confiderably aided the procefsj but he found that the
leaft particle of oil between the bars greatly obftrufted
it, as did the fmalleft piece of the thinneft gold leaf.
He found that bars which were rough acquired a more
powerful

i'-srer'men- powerful majrnetifm than thofe which were moderately

■ ‘ 7s' - the fmt degrees of magnetifm more expeditioufly than
fmooth bars, but did not receive fo ftrong an impregna¬
tion as the latter.
The method of making artificial magnets has been
greatly improved by M. Conlomb, who in a feries of
memoirs, printed in the Memoirs of the Academy of
Sciences, and of the National Inftitute of Paris, has
communicated a number of valuable obfervations and
experiments that have contributed, perhaps more than
any preceding labours, to the advancement both of
the theory and praflice of magnetifm. Many years ago
he publifhed his procefs for making very powerful arti¬
ficial magnets.
In his operations he ufes four very ftrong magnets
previoufty impregnated. He placed his two ftrongeft;
magnets, (as NS, NS, fig. 19.) on an horizontal plane
in one right line, at fuch a diftance that they might be
a few lines nearer to each other than the length of the
needle n r intended to be magnetized. He afterwards
took the two magnets N' S', and inclining them as in the
method of Aipinus, he placed them firtl on the middle
of the needle, or with their poles nearly in contaft.
He then drew each magnet, without changing its in¬
clination, to the extremity of the needle, and repeated
this operation 5 or 6 times on each face of the needle.
It is clear, that in this operation the poles of the needle
n r remain fixed and invariable at the extremities of
the needle, by means of the two ftrong magnets NS
on which it refts. The effeft produced by thefe can
only be augmented by the a£hon of the two fuperior
magnets, which concur in magnetizing all the particles
of the needle in the fame dire61ion.
He found likewife, that in this method of magneti¬
zing there is a greater certainty of giving to both fur-
faces of needles intended to determine the magnetic
meridian, an equal degree of magnetifm •, a circum-
ftance deferving of the greateft attention in the con-
ftruftion of compaffes, if the needle be fufpended with
its broadeft furface parallel to the horizon.
After thefe previous procelfes, he took 30 bars of
fteel hardened and tempered to the temper of a fpring,
five or fix lines broad, two or three lines thick, and 36
inches long. The blades of fencing foils, fuch as are
found in the (hops, make pretty good magnets. Eng-
lifti ftieet fteel cut into pieces one inch wide, harden¬
ed and lowered to fpring temper, is preferable. When
each compound magnet is to contain no more than 15
or 20 pounds of fteel, it is fufticient to make the bars 30
or 36 inches long.
He magnetized each bar fingly, according to the me¬
thod already defcribed. He then took two reftangular
parallelopipedons of very foft iron, well polifhed, fix
inches in lengh, between 20 and 24 lines broad, and 10
tar 1 2 lines thick. With thefe two parallelopipedons, re-
prefented fig. 20. at N and S, he formed the armour
of his magnet by enveloping one extremity of each
parallelopipedon with a ftratum of his magnetic bars, fo
that the extremities of the parallelopipedons may projecl
beyond the extremities of the bars 20 or 24 lines, and
the other end may be enveloped by the ends of the fet
of bars. On this firft: layer of fteel bars of three or four
lines thick he places a fecond, three inches ftiorter than
the find, fo that the firft projects beyond the fecond

from efcaping.
Fig. 20. reprefents two artificial magnets compofed
according to the method juft defcribed. N and S are
the extremities of the two iron paralleiopipedons. The
two other extremities are inclofed by the bars. Each
magnet thus compounded is folidly connefled together
by the copper pieces marked b, d, b'. The pieces
of contact A, R, join the oppoiite poles of the mag¬
nets.
Pie found by experience, that with an apparatus of
this form, each part weighing 15 or 2olbs. a force of
80 or loclb. will be required to feparate the pieces of
contaft ; and that when an ordinary needle of the com-
pafs is placed on the two extremities of the compound
bars, fig. 20. they become magnetized to faturation, with¬
out being rubbed with the upper pair. When magnets
ol greater force are defired, it isneceffary, in proportion
as the number of bars is increafed, to augment their
length alfo, and the dimenfions of the parallelopipedons
of iron which ferve for the armour. It would be eafy to
afcertain the different dimenfions which the magnets
ought to have, in a manner iufticiently accurate for prac¬
tice, from the laws of magnetifm, and the pofition of
the centre of aftion of the bars of fteel of different
lengths and thicknefs.
2. Iron or Jleel is rendered magneticai by being placed^®
in a pojition correfponding to the magnetic meridian.
It has been often obferved, that a bar of iron which co™es,ma^ ’
has itood for a long time exatlly or nearly in the mag- pofition.
netic direction, has acquired a degree of magnetic
power, the extremities poffetfing oppofite polarity. In
this and other northern parts of Eurupe, old vanes •}£
turrets, window bars, and even pokers that have flood
long inclined in the chimney corner, are often very fen-
fibly magnetic, their lower extremity becoming a north,
and the upper a fouth pole. In the higheft part of the
fteeple of St Giles’s church in Edinburgh, on the north
fide, the upper bar of a hand-rail leading to a flair is
very magneticai. It is worthy of remark, that thofe
parts of fuch old bars which have become foliated and
crumbly by expofure to the air are the mod magneti¬
cai. This magnetic ftate of perpendicular iron bars
was, as we are informed by Dr Gilbert, firft obfer¬
ved in the vane fpindle of the Auguftine church at
Mantua. ^
3. A bar of Jleel long hammered or expofed to violently ham-
friblion, while lying in the magnetic meridian, becomes mering or
magnetic. friction.
This fa£! was well known to Dr Gilbert, who in
a plate reprefents a blackfmith hammering a bar of
fteel in the magnetic pofition. Many fmiths tools,
fuch as long drills, that receive great preffure while in
motion, broaches that are worked with a long le¬
ver, fo as to aft very faff, become very fenfibly mag¬
neticai j the lower end, in thefe latitudes, being always
a north pole. When a fteel punch is driven hard into
a piece of iron, the punch has fometimes been render¬
ed magneticai by a fingle blow. There is fcarcely a
cutting or boring tool in a fidth’s {hop that does
not poffefs fome degree of magnetic power. Even fob:

By heat.
Experimen- quired is commonly permanent. From this circum-
tai Ilmftra. {|ance is difficult to procure for nice experiments
■ ^ . pieces of iron that do not poffefs fome degree of magne-
tifm, and hence thefe experiments do not always fucceed.
It is therefore convenient to know how to deprive iron
and fteel of magnetifm, and the method of doing this
will appear from what will be faid in the next fec-
tion.
The fteel balances of watches are often magnetic,
fometimes even fhewing evident polarity; a circum-
ftance which is found to have fome effedt in difturbing
the proper going of fuch watches or time-pieces. Hence
it is recommended to make the balances of brafs. See
a paper on this fubjedt by Mr Varley, in the firft volume
of the Philofophical Magazine.
4. Magnetifm may be induced on fubjlances that are
fufceptible of it, by heat.
Dr Gilbert remarks that fuch ores of iron as are in
that particular metallic ftate, which he confiders as
molt fufceptible of magnetifm, will acquire this power
by being kept long in a red heat, while in a magnetic
diredtion j and that their polarity correfponds to their
polition, that end of the mafs which is oppofite the
north becoming a north pole. By many experiments
made both by Dr Gilbert, and fince his time by Dr
Hock, on iron and Heel bars, it appears that thefe ac¬
quire permanent magnetifm by being expofed to a
ftrong heat, and fuffered to cool gradually while lying
in the magnetic diredlion ; but that the magnetifm thus
acquired by fteel rods is much ftronger and more dur¬
able, if they are fuddenly quenched with cold w'ater,
fo as to give them a very hard temper. Dr Hooke
found that the end of the bar next the north, or the
low*er end of a vertical bar, always became its perma¬
nent north pole, and the upper end, even when quench¬
ed, while the reft wTas fuffered to cool gradually, be¬
came a very fenfible fouth pole. If thefe operations
were performed on bars placed in a polition at right
angles to the magnetic diredlion, no magnetifm wras
acquired. Dr Gilbert makes a remarkable obfervation
refpedfing the pofition of a magnetic needle brought
near an ignited bar of iron, wffiich w'as fome years ago
repeated in the Philofophical Tranfadlions as a newT dif-
covery. “ Bacillum ferreum, valide ignitum appone ver-
forio excito : flat verforium, nec ad tale ferrum conver-
titur : fed fatim ut primum de candore alifiiantulurn
remiferit, conjluit illico.'1'' Thus it appears that iron is
not fufceptible of magnetifm when red hot, but that it
acquires magnetic power during its cooling. Dr Gil¬
bert afeertained the degree of heat moft favourable to
the produdion of magnetifm, but from his want of pro¬
per thermometers he did not fucceed. Dr Robifon
found that though a bright red or a white heat does
not make iron lufceptible of magnetifm while it is ex¬
pofed to fuch a heat, it predifpofes it for becoming
magnetic*!. He found that when a bar of fteel was
made to acquire magnetifm by being tempered in the
magnetic diredion, the acquired magnetifm was much
ftronger when the bar w^as firft made very hot, even
though allowed to acquire its moft magnetical ftate be¬
fore being quenched, than if it had been heated only to
this latter degree. Nay, he always found it ftronger if
quenched while red hot.
He alfo found that when he heated a fmall fteel bar
red-hot, and quenched it while lying between two

magnets, it acquired a much ftronger magnetic power Experimen-
than it would acquire in any other way.
Mr Canton contrived the following method of pro-1
ducing magnetifm in fteel bars, without the afiiftance
either of natural or artificial magnets. 61
Take twelve bars, fix of foft, and fix of hard fteel, Canton’s
the former three inches long, one-fourth of an inch rne^?°^
broad, and one-twentieth of an inch thick } with two ^.ag_
pieces of iron, each half the length of one of the bars, nets,
but of the fame breadth and thicknefs. The fix hard
bars fhould be each five inches and a half long, one-
half inch broad, and three-twentieths of an inch thick,
with two pieces of iron of half the length, but of the
fame breadth and thicknefs as one of the hard bars j
and let all the bars be marked with a line quite round
them at one end •, then take an iron poker and tongs,
or two bars of iron, the larger they are, and the longer
they have been ufed, the better j and fixing the poker
upright, or rather in the magnetical line between the
knees, hold to it, near the top, one of the foft bars,
having its marked end downwards, by a piece of few-
ing filk, which muft be palled tight by the left hand,
that the bar may not Aide; then grafping the tongs *
with the right hand, a little below the middle, and
holding them nearly in a vertical pofition, let the bar
be ftroked by the lowrer end from the bottom to the
top about ten times on each fide, which w'ill give it a
magnetic powrer fufficient to lift a fmall key at the
marked end $ which end, if the bar wrere fulpended on
a point, wmuld turn towards the north, and is there¬
fore called the north pole, and the unmarked end, for
the fame reafon is called the fouth pole. Four of the
foft bars being impregnated after this manner, lay the
other twro parallel to each other, at a quarter of an
inch diftant, between the twm pieces of iron belonging
to them, a north and a fouth pole againft each piece of
iron ; then take twro of the bars already made magneti¬
cal, and place them together fo as to make a double
bar in thicknefs, the north pole of the one even with
the fouth pole of the other, and the remaining two be¬
ing put to thefe, one on each fide, fo as to have two
north and two fouth poles together, feparate the north
from the fouth poles at one end by the interpofition of
fome hard fubftance (I, fig. 21.), and place them per¬
pendicularly with that end downward on the middle of
one of the parallel bars AC, the tw-o north poles to
wards its fouth end, and the two fouth poles towards
its north end. Slide them three or four times back¬
ward and forward the whole length of the bar ; then
removing them from the middle of this bar, place them
on the middle of the other bar BD as before dire&ed,
and go over that in the fame manner; then turn both
bars the other fide upwards, and repeat the former ope¬
ration : this being done, take the two bars from between
the pieces of iron, and piecing the two outermoft of
the touching bars in their ftead, let the other two be
the outermoft of the four to touch thefe with \ and this
procefs being repealed till each pair of bars have been
touched three or four times over, will give them a con-
fiderable magnetic power.
When the fmall bars have been thus rendered mag--
netic, in order to communicate the magnetifm to the
large bars, lay two of them on the table, between their
iron conduftors as before 5 then form a compound mag¬
net with the fix fmall bars, placing three of them with

i?xperimen-the north poles downwards, and the three others with
Ui'oor':lra~ the foiith poles downwards. Place the two parcels at
a.„  . an angle, as was done w ith four of them, the north ex¬
tremity of the one parcel being put contiguous to the
fouth extremity of the other-, and with this compound
magnet llroke four of the large bars, one after ano¬
ther, about twenty times on each fide, by which means
they will acquire lume magnetic power.
- w ben the four large bars have been fo far rendered
magnetic, the fmall bars are laid afide, and the large
ones are ftrengthened by themfelves, in the manner
followed with the fmall bars.
To expedite the operation, the bars ought to be fix¬
ed in a groove, or between brafs pins, otherwife the
attraction and friCHon between the bars will be conti¬
nually deranging them when placed between the con¬
ductors.
This whole procefs may be gone through in about
half an hour, and each of the large bars, if w^ell har¬
dened, will lift about 28 ounces troy, and they are fit¬
ted for all the purpofes of magnetifm in navigation and
experimental philofophy. The half dozen being put
into a cafe in fuch a manner as that no two poles of
the fame name may be together, and their irons wdth
them as one bar, they will retain the virtue they have
received •, but if their power fhould, by making experi¬
ments, be ever fo much impaired-, it may be reftored
W'ithout any foreign affiitance in a few minutes.
Thefe bars mult be kept in a wmoden box, arranged
in fuch a manner that their oppofite poles may lie to¬
gether, as reprefented at fig. 22.
There are various methods of communicating a per¬
manent magnetifm to ferruginous bodies, by means of a
bar rendered magnetic, by pofition, of which the molt
limple is that deferibed by Mr Marcel, whofe experi¬
ments were made in the year 1726. Being employed
in making fome obfervations on the magnetic power
which he found in great pieces of iron, lie took a large
vice weighing 90 pounds, in which he fixed a large
anvil weighing I2lbs. The fteel to which he wifhed
to give the magnetic power was laid upon the anvil in
a north and fouth pofition, which happened to be the
diagonal of the fquare furface of the latter. He then
took a four cornered piece of iron an inch thick every
way, 33 inches long, weighing about 81bs. having one
end rounded and brightly poliihed, the other being
tapered. Holding then the fteel faft upon the anvil
with the one hand, he took the iron bar in the other,
and holding it perpendicularly, lie rubbed the fleel
hard with the rounded part towards him from north to'
fouth, always carrying the bar far enough round about
Ko begin at the north. Having thus given io or 12
ftrokes, the fteel was turned upfide down, and rubbed
as much on the other fide. Proceeding in this manner
till it had been rubbed 40Q times, the fteel was as
ftrongly magnetic as if it had been touched by a pov.-er-
iul loadftone. The place where he began to rub was
always the north pole. In thefe experiments it feme-
times happened that the virtue was imparted by a few
ftrokes ; nay,, by a fingle ftroke a fmall needle was
made to receive a very confiderable power. Thus he
imparted to two compafs needles fueh a degree of mag¬
netic power, that one lifted three-fourths, and another
a whole ounce of iron, and although thefe needles were
anoiqted with lintfeed oil to keep them from rufting,

and a hard coat was thus formed upon them, they Experimen-
ncverthelefs retained their power. Thus alfo a knife tal
vvas made fo ftrougly magnetical, that it would take up , llons' ,
an ounce and three-fourths of iron. Four fmall pieces
of fteel, each an inch long, and one-twelfth of an inch
broad, as thin as the fpring of a watch, were thus im¬
pregnated with the magnetic power, and then joined
into a fmall artificial magnet; which at its firft forma¬
tion took up eight times its owm weight of iron ; and
after being fix years kept in the moft carelefs manner,
was found to have gained rather than loft any thing of
its power. In the courfe of his experiments, Mr Mar¬
cel found, that the end at which he began to rub vras
always.the north pole, whatever pofition the fteel was
laid in. On rubbing a piece of fteel from one end to the
middle, and then from the other end to the middle, it
acquired two north poles, one at each end, the middle
being a' fouth pole. Beginning to rub from the middle
towards each end, he found a north pole in the middle,
and a fouth pole at each .extremity. ^
Magnetifm may be communicated to a fmall piece Method of
of foft fteel in the following manner: take two iron
bars of about an inch fquare, and upwards of three ^eet offca iteef
in length ■, keep them in the magnetical line, or in a
perpendicular pofture, as reprefented fig. ■23. Let the
piece of fteel CB be either faftened to the edge of a
table, or held by an affiftant ; and placing the lower
extremity of the bar AB, and the upper extremity of
the bar CD, on oppofite lides, and in the middle of
the fteel, ftroke the latter from the middle toivards
its extremities, moving both bars at the fame time.
When both are arrived at the extremities of the fteel,
remove them from it, and apply them again to the
middle. Do fo for 40 or 50 times, and the fteel will
be found to have a confiderable degree of magnetic
powrr. Care, however, muft be taken, in removing
the bars, not to draw them along the furface of the
fteel, or the experiment will not fucceed, becaufe the
magnetifm is deftroyed by the contrary ftrokes. g
The late Dr Gowin Knight pofleffed a furprifingD,-Knights
Ikill in magnetifm, being able to communicate an ex- artificial
traordinary degree of attrafliye or repulfive power, and loadftones.
to alter or reverfe the poles at pleafure j but as he re-
fufed to difeover his methods upon any terms what¬
ever (even as he faid, though he ftiould receive in re¬
turn as many guineas as he could cairy), thefe curious
and valuable fecrets have died with him. In the 69th
volume of the P'.ulofophical Tranfadlions, however, Mr
Benjamin Wilfon has given a procefs, which at leaft
difeovers one of the leading principles of Dr Knight’s
art, and may perhaps be a means of difeovering the
whole to thofe who fhall be lefs referved. The doc¬
tor’s procefs, according to Mr Wilfon, was as follows.
Having provided hinftelf with a great quantity of clean
iron filings, he put them into a large tub, that was
more than one-third filled with clean water 5 he then,
with great labour, worked thd tub to and fro for many
hours together, that the fridion between the grains of
iron by this treatment might break off fuch fmaller
parts as would ^remain fufpended in the water for a
time. The obtaining of thefe very fmall particles in
fufficient xjuantity leemed to him to be one of the prin¬
cipal defiderata in the experiment.- The water being
by this treatment rendered very muddy, he poured the
fame into a clean iron veffel, leaving the filings be¬
hind 5
Chap. IT. M A G N
Experimen-hind ; and when the water had flood long enough to
tal Tllullra- be clear, he poured it out carefully, without difturbing
. tlons- fuch of the fediment as ftill remained *, which now ap-
v peared reduced almoft to an impalpable powder. T his
pow'der was afterwards removed into another veflel in
order to dry it; but as he had not obtained a proper
quantity thereof by this one flep, he wras obliged to re¬
peat the procefs many times. Having at laft procured
enough of this very fine powder, the next thing was to
make a pafte of it, and that with fome vehicle which
would contain a confiderable quantity of the inflammable
matter ; for this purpofe he had recourfe to lintfeed oil
in preference to all other fluids. With thefe two in¬
gredients only he made a ftiff paile, and took particular
care to knead it well before he moulded it into conve¬
nient (hapes. Sometimes, wdiile the pafte continued in
its foft flate, he would put the impreflion of a feal upon
the feveral pieces j one of which is in the Britilh Mu-
fleum. This pafte was then put upon wood, and fome-
times on tiles, in order to bake or dry it before a mo¬
derate fire, at about the diftance of a foot. He found
that a moderate fire was moft proper, becaufe a greater-
degree of heat made the compofition frequently crack
in many places. The time required for the baking or
drying of this pafte was generally about five or fix
hours before it attained a futficient degree of hardnefs.
When that was done, and the (everal baked pieces
were become cold, he gave them their magnetic power
in any direction he pleafed, by placing them between
the extreme ends of his large magazine of artificial
magnets for a lew feconds or more as he faw occafion.
By this method the pow-er they acquired was fuch, that
when any of thefe pieces were held between two of his
beft ten guinea bars, with its poles purpofely inverted,
it immediately of itfelf turned about to recover its na¬
tural direftion, which the force of thofe very powerful
bars was not fulftcient to counteradl.
In the 66th volume of the Philofophical Tranfa&ions
we have the following account from Dr Fothergill, of
Dr Knight’s method of imitating natural magnets, but
which is by Mr Cavallo fuppofed to be fome miftake
or mifinformation. “ I do not know, fays he,” that
ever the dodlor (Dr^Knight) left behind him any de-
fcription of a compofition he had made to form artifi¬
cial loadftones. 1 have feen in his poffefiion, and many
other of his friends have likewife feen, fuch a compofi¬
tion, which retained the magnetic virtue in a manner
much more fixed than either any real loadftone, or any
magnetic bar, however well tempered. In the natural
ones he could change the poles in an inftant, fo like¬
wife in the hardeft bars, but in the compofition the
poles were immoveable. He had feveral fmall pieces
of this corapofition w-hich had ftrong magnetic powders.
The largeft was about half an inch in breadth, very
little longer than broad, and near one-fourth of an inch
thick. It was not armed, but the ends were powerful¬
ly magnetic nor could the poles be altered, though it
was placed between two of his largeft bars, and they
were very ftrongly impregnated. The mafs w-as not
very heavy, and had much the appearance of a
piece of black lead, though not quite fo fhining. I
believe he never divulged the compofition, but I think
he once told me, the bafis of it was filings of iron re¬
duced by long-continued attrition to a perfeflly impal-
E T I S M. 379
pable ftate, and then incorporated with iome pliant Expenmen-
matter to give it due conlutence. t;ons
From thefe accounts it appears that the bafis of Dr i, — v ~—.i
Knight’s artificial loadftones was the black powder to
w'hich iron filings are reduced by being fhaken with
water, or the b/ack oxide of iron, formerly called mar¬
tial mthiops. Hence Mr Cavallo luppofes that the fol^
lowing receipt for imitating the natural magnets will
anfwer the purpofe.
Take fome martial oethiops, reduced into a very fine
powder, or, which is more eafily procured, b/ack oxide
of iron, the feales which fall from red-hot iron!
when hammered, and are found abundantly in fmiths
(hops. Mix this powder with drying lintfeed oil, fo
as to form it into a very ftiff pafte, and fhape it in a
mould fo as to give it any form you require, whether
of a terrella, a human head, or any other. 1 his done,
put it into a warm place for fome w'eeks, and it wall
dry fo as to become very hard •, then render it magnetic
by the application of powerful magnets, and it will ac¬
quire a confiderable power.
SECT. IV. Of the CircumJ/anccs which tend to impair or
dejiroy the Magnetic Power. '
65
The magnetic power in all its modifications, whether Magnetifm
of attraction, repulfion, or polarity, is in general tem-^™^
porary and perithing. The beft magnets, W'hether na¬
tural or artificial, unkfs carefully preferved, with at¬
tention to certain circumftances that will prelently ap¬
pear, are obferved to have their magnetic power dimi-
niflied. Natural magnets, and artificial magnets made
of fteel tempered as hard as poflible, retain their power
moft obftinately, and feldom entirely lofe it except un¬
der circumftances which we know to be unfavourable
to its durability. Magnets of fteel of a fpring temper,
are much fooner weakened, lofe more of their force
merely by keeping, and finally’ retain little or none of
it. Soft fleel and iron feldom retain magnetic power
wflien removed from the magnet where they acquired
it, unlefs their metallic ftate undergoes fome change.
The following circumfttyices have been obferved to
be moft powerful in diminifhing or deftroying the power
of magnets. x,
1. Improper pofition. Nothing has fo much effect in ^
impairing the power of a magnet as keeping it in anj[on?
improper pofition, that is, too far from the magnetic
line. If the axis of the magnet be placed in a direc¬
tion that ^s at right angles with the magnetic meridian,
that is, in this latitude nearly E. N. E. and W. N. W,
it will fooneft lofe its magnetic pow er ; and if it be
placed in the magnetic line, but in a contrary pofition,
or wflth the north pole where the fouth pole thould be,
if permitted to vibrate freely, it will gradually become
weaker every day, and unlefs it be a natural magnet,
or an artificial one made of very hard tempered fteel,
it will, in no very long time, entirely lofe its magnetic
power. 67
2. Heat. The diflipation of magnetic power is great-By heat;
ly promoted by heating the magnet. The heat of
boiling water has a fenfible effeA in this way ; but if
the magnet be expofed to a red heat, its power is en¬
tirely deftroyed, as has been long knowm. Dr Gilbert
obferved that the pow’er of magnets was deftroyed by a
3 B 2 heat
38° M A G N
> TKeC;7- ,neat t^at lvas not Sufficient to make tlie metal vifiblei n
y ^ darkj and Mr Canton found that the heat of boil¬
ing water weakened the power of a magnet, but that
tije greateil part of tins was recovered as the magnet
cooled. If the heat be applied when the magnet lies
in a politico molt favourable to the diffipation of mag-
netilm, the power is fooneft dellroyed ; hence, the belt
way to deprive iron or fteel of accidental magnetifm
is, to heat it red-hot, and allow it to cool while
lying in a direction perpendicular to the magnetic
line.
M. Couiomb has afcertained that at 200 degrees of
heat, two fifths of the magnetifm of a magnet is diffi-
^ pated, and that at 500 degrees the whole is loft.
By violent 3' violent treatment. It is very extraordinary
treatment; *hat the power of a magnet is impaired by rough ufage.
Dr Gilbert obferved that a magnet which he had
powerfully impregnated was greatly weakened by a
lingle fall on the floor ) and fince his time it has been
obferved that when a magnet falls on a flone, or re¬
ceives any concuffion that makes it ring, it is injured
much more than by being beaten writh any thing foft
and yielding. When a natural magnet is ground with
coarfe powders, in order to bring it to any required
form,, it is confiderably weakened. This fhews the
propriety of altering the natural form of loadftones as
little as poffible, and where this is neceffary, of doing
it as expeditioufly as may be, by cutting them brifkly
Sf) in the thin difks of a lapidary’s wheel.
By fi nilar 4. Placing them near each other with their Jimilar
vwfo{heing ^CS Magnets fituated in this way always weaken
1 e’ each other, and when a powerful magnet is placed near
a weaker, with their fimilar poles oppofed, the polarity
of the weaker is frequently reverfed, that is, if the
pole were north it becomes fouth, and vice verfa.
When the weaker magnet is a natural loadftone, or
has been made of hard tempered fteel, its original po¬
larity is reftored when the improper pofition is changed;
but if it has been made of fpring-tempered fteel, the
alteration is generally permanent, and often as com¬
plete as while the magnets were in the neighbourhood
of each other.
Chap. III. Theory of Magnetifm.
'Opinions of RESPECTING the notions which the ancient philofo-
the and- phers entertained about the caufe of magnetic pheno-
ents* mena, we know very little. One curious opinion which
they entertained of the reafon why a magnet was im¬
proved by the contaft of iron, is worth noticing. They
conceived that the magnet fed upon the iron, and hence
acquired additional attractive power; and when de¬
prived of this pabulum, it grew weak and languid.

on the lubjecf. . Some faid that the needle was diretfted v '
by a.certain point in the heavens, which was little more
than faying that it pointed one way. Others alcribed
tne direction of the needle to vail magnetic rocks fitua¬
ted in the earth ; but as to the exa£t iituation of thefe
rocks, they d,d not give themfelves the trouble to in¬
quire, till Fracaftcri obferved, that, if thole rocks are
fuppafed to be lituated in any part of the globe yet vi-
fited by navigators, and if, as we mult fuppofe, they
adt like loadftones, they will caufe the diredtion to be
very different from what is obferved. He therefore
placed them fotnewhere in the inaccetiible polar regions,
though not immediately at the poles. Norman,°who’
as we have feen ( Ijifping Needle'), difeovered the dip
of the magnetic needle, and obferved that in every part
of Europe, the north pole pointed very far below the
horizon, was naturally ltd to alcribe this eftedl to the
influence of the earth, though he does not exprefs him-
felf as ii he thought that the needle was attracted by
any point within the earth, but only that it was always
directed to luch a point.
From comparing the different pofitions of the coni- Gilbert’s
pafs needle, as deferibed by Norman, with the pofitions theory,
which he had hinftelf obferved fmall needles to affirme
in relation to a magnet, Dr Gilbert was naturally led
to. confider the earth as a great loadftone, or elfe con¬
taining a great loauftone within it, which arranged the
dipping needle, or the needle of the compafs, in the
fame manner as he obferved a fmall needle polled on its
pivot, to.be arranged by a large magnet. Dr Gilbert
has explained his theory at large in his Physio/ogia Nova
de Magnete, et de Tellure Magno Magnete. It may be
briefly exprefled in the following terms. AH the ap¬
pearances of natural magnetilm are fimilar to what
would be obferved in the earth, w^ere a large magnet
with its poles fituated near the poles of the equator, viz.
the north pole not far from Baffin’s bay in North Ame¬
rica, and the fouth pole in about the oppolite part of
the globe. If a dipping needle were expofed to the
influence of fuch a large magnet, it muft arrange itfelf
in a plane paffing through the magnetic poles, a pofi¬
tion indicated' very nearly by the mariners needle ; and
the more we recede from the equator of the great mag¬
net, the more muft the dipping needle be inclined to
the horizon.
Dr Gilbert’s theory was equally ingenious and im- 7*
portant, and aftords, if firmly eftablithed, a complete
explanation of all the phenomena of magnetifm. At
the time it was firft publilhed, however, obfervations
were neither fufficiently numerous, nor fufficiently ac¬
curate, to enable the author to affign the real pofition
of the great magnet, nor to afeertain its laws of aftion.
I he theory was chiefly founded on obfervations made
by the dipping needle, and though thofe inftruments
made by Norman were more accurate than might have
been expe&ed at fo early a period of the fcience, the ob¬
fervations made with them cannot, from many circum-
ftances, be implicitly relied on. We are ftill in want of a
numerouscolledhon of oblervations on the dip, m order to
perfeft our knowledge of the magnetic poles. We can
only fay that the earth a£!s on the compafs needle in
the fame manner as a large magnet would adl; but the
appearances do not feem to refefnble the effeefs of what

Theory, porous poles, but rather fuch as would refult from the
^ adlion of a very irregular loadflone with its poles very
much diffufed.
73 It is unfortunate that our moil numerous obferva'ions
of the dip have not been made in thofe places where
they would be the moft inftruftive. Dr Robifon was of
opinion that a feries of obfervations ihould be obtained,
extending from New Zealand northward, acrofs the
Pacific ocean to Cape Fairweather on the weftern coaft
of North America, whence it ihould be continued
through that part of the continent. A fecond feries
might extend from the Cape of Good Hope along the
weiiern coaft of Africa to the tropic of Capricorn ;
thence acrofs the interior of the African continent
through Sicily, Italy, Dalmatia, the eaftern part of
Germany, the gulf of Bothnia, Lapland, and the weft¬
ern part of Greenland. This feries would be nearly in
a plane paffing through the probable fituations of the
poles. A third feries might extend at right angles to
the laft, fo as to form a fmall circle croffing the former,
palTing near Japan, through the iiland of Borneo, and
the wTeflern part of New Holland ; near Mexico, and
a few degrees weft of Eafter iiland. Here and at Bor¬
neo there would be a confiderable inclination of the
magnetic plane to the horizon, though this cannot be
found out. There are, however, other points of this
circle in which the dip is confiderable, where the incli¬
nation may be dilcovered. In ftiort, all circumftances
feem to indicate a multiplicity of poles, or what renders
calculation moft difficult, an irregular magnetiim in
which the polarity is very much diftufed.
Philofophers are very much divided refpedfting the fi-
tuation of the magnetic poles of the earth. We fhall
here ftate only a few of their opinions, referving a fuller
account of fome of them for the article Variation of
the Cowpafs.

Kow’ever ingenious this hypothefis of Dr Gilbert
was, it appears tojiave been nothing more than a fuga¬
cious conje<fture. The hypothefis, however, is con¬
firmed into a rational theory by many obfervations and
experiments which were unknown or unthought of in
oflfietheo- ^Gilbert’s time

T r S M. ; 381
an upright iron bar on the oppofite ends of a compafs- Theory,
needle, according as one end or the other of the bar is '
next the earth (fee Variation of the Compafs') is an
abundant proof of the juftnefs of this theory.
We can imitate that experiment in a very fatisfatlory
manner by artificial magnetifm •, thus forming a juft
comparifon betw’een the aclion of the earth and that of
a magnet.
Let a large bar magnet, as SAN (fig. 24.) be fup-
ported fo as to have its ends detached from furrounding
bodies. Then place a fmall needle nicely poiied, as Bs
about three inches below N, the north pole of the mag¬
net, and fo that its diredlive power for the magnet may
be very weak. Now take a fmall piece of foft iron and
hold it in fuch a pofition as is reprefented at C its
lower end becoming a north pole will attradh the fouth
pole of the needle. Now, while the needle is kept in
the fame pofition, turn round the piece of iron into the
pofition D ; the fquth pole of the needle will be feen to
avoid it, and the north pole will be attradled. Here
the magnet may be compared to the earth, and the
fmall piece of iron to the iron bar in Mr Hindfhaw’s
experiment.
Again, it has been feen that magnetifm may be pro¬
duced in iron or fteel by hammering or heating them
while in a determinate pofition with refpedl to the
earth. The fame effedt will be produced by the fame
proceffes while the iron or fteel is in the neighbourhood
of a powerful magnet.
Laftly, the circumlfance of the magnetic inclination
of the north pole of the dipping needle being diminish¬
ed, and the horizontality of the compafs needle de-
ftroyed, as we afcend above the earth, is an additional
and certain evidence of the truth of this theory.
In ffiort, we may confider it as demonftrated, that
the earth is a great magnet, or contains a great mag¬
net, by the influence of which the diredlion of the
needle and all the magnetic pow-er acquired by iron,
when placed in a proper pofition, are produced.
A further illuftration and application of this theory
will be given prefently, when we have confidered fome
other hyppthefes pofterior to that of Dr Gilbert. ^5
It was very early an objedl with philofophers to af-Theories of
fign the immediate caufe of magnetic attraction and re-impuifioiu
pulfion, and of that faculty of mutual impregnation
which fo remarkably diftinguiffies iron from all other
fubftances. In particular, the curious arrangement of
iron filings ftrewed round a magnet forcibly attracted
their attention. It is fcarcely poffible to obferve this
arrangement without conceiving the idea of a ftream of
matter iffuing from one of the poles of the magnet,
moving round it, entering by the other pole, and again
iifuing by its former outlet. Accordingly, fuch an
idea wTas entertained in the earlieft times ; but very dif¬
ferent notions prevailed as to the manner in which fuch (
a rtream produced the eftedts obferved. One of the,
fimpleft methods was, to, conceive it a fling by impul-
fion, like any other dream of fluid matter. This idea
was entertained by Lucretius, who fuppofed the fur¬
rounding air to be fwept out of the way by the impul-
fion of the fluid, which thus rufhing round the magnet
carried the iron filings towards it.
In the laft century Euler framed an hypothefis of
magnetifm on this theory of impuliion. He fuppofes,Euler’s hy«
that the two principal cavf n which concur in producing
the
M A G N E
the wonderful properties of a magnet, are. Firft, 'A
particular ftru&ure of the internal pores of the magnets,
and of magnetical bodies j and, Secondly, An external
agent or fluid, which a£b> upon, and pafles through
thefe pores. This fluid he fuppofes to be the folar at-
mofphere, or that fubtile matter called eiher, which fills
our fyflem.
Indeed, moll writers on this fubjedl agreed in fuppo-
fing that there are cotpufcles of a peculiar form and
energy, which continually circulate around and through
a magnet; and that a vortex of the fame kind circulates
around and through the earth.
“ A magnet, befides the pores which it has in com¬
mon with other bodies, has alfo other pores confider-
ably fmaller, deflined only for the paffage of the mag¬
netic fluid. Thefe pores are fo difpofed as to commu¬
nicate one with the other, forming tubes or channels,
by which the magnetic fluid pafles from one end to the
other. The pores are fo formed, that this fluid can
only pafs through them in one direction, but cannot re¬
turn back the fame way ; fimilar to the veins and lym¬
phatic veffels of the animal body, which are furniftied
with valves for this purpofe : So that the pores of the
magnet may be conceived to be formed into feveral
narrow contiguous tubes, parallel to each other, as at
A, B, fig. 25. through which the finer part of the
ether patTes freely from A to B, but cannot return back
on account of the refiflance it meets with at «, tj, 6,
nor overcome the refirtance of the groiTer ether, which
occalions and continues the motion. For fuppofing the
pole A of a magnet, filled with feveral mouths or open
ends of fimilar tubes, the magnetic fluid, preffed by the
groffer parts of the ether, will pafs towards B with an
inconceiveable rapidity, which is proportionable to the
elafticity of the ether itfelf; this matter which, till it
■arrives at B, is feparated from the tubes by the groffer
parts, then meets with it again, and has its velocity re¬
tarded, and its dire£lion changed •, the fiream, reflect¬
ed by the ether, with which it cannot immediately mix,
is bent on both fides towards C and D, and deferibes,
but with lefs velocity, the curves DE and C F f, and
approaching by the curves d and c, falls in with the
effluent matter m rn, and again enters the magnet ; and
*}■ Lettres a forms tliat remarkable atmofphere, which is vifible
in the arrangement of fteel filings on a piece of paper
that is placed over a magnet” f.
We have, already had occalion (fee the article Im¬
pulsion) to make fome obfervations on the general
<lo£lrine of impulfion, and thefe need not be here re¬
peated. RefpeCting the explanations afforded by the
canals and dock-gates in Euler’s hypothefis, opening in
one diredion and (hutting in the other, we may ob-
ferve, that as thefe conftruftions are altered in a mo¬
ment in a bar of foft iron, merely by changing the po-
fition of the magnet, it is allonilhing that they fhould
ever have been conceived by fo acute a philofopher.
Even fuppofing fuch circumftances to take place, the
efteCts refulting from them fliould be the reverie of what
are aCtually obferved, as the impelling itream ftiould
move thofe bodies leait which afford the readieit chan¬
nels for its paffage. If the iron filings were arranged
by this impelling Itream, they fhould be carried along
with it, and if they are carried towards one pole of
the magnet, they ftiould be driven away from the
other.

/Epinus, of the academy of Pefer{hurgh, whofe theory Theory,
of electricity we have explained and illuftrated at confi- — ~J
derable length, was led by the analogy obferved be- 0^
tween the phenomena of eleCtricity and thofe of magne- j£p;nugt
tifm, and in particular from the refemblance between
the attractions and repulfions of the tourmalin and
thofe of a magnet, to conceive the idea that both claffes
of phenomena might be explained in a fimilar manner,
or that the phenomena of magnetifm, like thofe of elec¬
tricity, were to be attributed to the motions of a cer¬
tain fluid exiiting in all bodies fufceptible of magne¬
tifm. This conjeCture was confirmed by obferving, that
when magnetifm was induced on a piece of iron by its
proximity to a magnet, the power of the magnet is not
fenfibly diminifhed. The following is an. abftraCt of
Mr Aipinus’s hypothefis.
1. There exifts in all magnetic bodies a fubftance
which may be called the magnetic fluid, the particles
of which repel each other with a force that decreafes as
the diitance increafes.
2. There is a mutual attraction, varying according
to the fame law, between the particles of the magnetic
fluid, and the particles of iron.
3. There is a mutual repullion among the particles
of iron, following the fame law.
4. The magnetic fluid is capable of moving through
the pores of iron, and foft fteel, without any confider-
able difficulty : but its motion is more and more ob-
ftruCtec! as the fteel receives a harder degree of temper j
and in fteel of the hardeft temper, and the ores of iron,
it moves with the greateft difficulty.
5. From the fuppofed attraction between the magne¬
tic fluid and iron, the latter may contain a certain de¬
terminate quantity of the former, and this quantity will
be fuch that the accumulating attraction of a particle
of it for the whole of the iron, balances the repulfion
between the particles of the whole fluid contained in the
iron j fuppofing the quantity of fluid competent to a
particle of iron to be fuch, that the repulfion between
it and the fluid competent to another particle of iron,
is alfo equal to its attraction for that particle of iron.
Therefore the attraction between the fluid in one iron
bar A, and the iron of another bar B, is juft equal to
the repulfion between the iron in A and the iron in B.
This determinate quantity of fluid in the iron is called
its natural quantity.
6. From the mobility of the fluid through the pores
of irpn, it may, by the agency of a proper external
force, be abftraCted from ont end o an iron bar, and
condenfed.in the other end. This, however, is a vio¬
lent ftate, and the mutual repulfion between the parti¬
cles of condenfed fluid, together with the attraction be¬
tween the fluid and that part of the iron which it has
quitted, tend to produce a more uniform diftribution.
It is evident that fomething of this tendency muft take
place in every ftate of condenfation and rarefaction, and
that a perfeCt equilibrium can be produced only when
the fluid is diffufed with perfeCt uniformity. This ftate
of uniformity may be called the natural ftate of the
body.
7. The production of fuch a uniform diftribution will
depend on the nature of the reftftance to the motion of
the fluid, oppofed by the iron in its various ftates. If
this refiftance arifes merely from the communication of
motion, like that which perfeCt fluids oppofe to the mo-
, tion

tion of folid bodies, fuch refinance may be overcome
by the weakeft tendency to uniform diffufion; but if,
as feems moft likely, the obftruftion is like that of a
clammy fluid, or of a foft plaftic body like clay, after
the accumulation arifing from the aftion of an external
force, it may remain after that force is removed $ and the
difluflon will ceafe when there is a perfect equilibrium
between the obflrudlion and the difiufing force.
As the illuflration of this theory in general cafes is
precifely fimilar, mutatis mutandis, with that of electri¬
city, fo fully detailed under the article Electricity,
from N° 299 to 348, wre need not repeat it here, but
may refer the reader to that treatife, requefting him
to confider the illuftration as relating to the magnetic
fluid.
It is proper, however, to remark here, that the phe¬
nomena of magnetifm are limited by this circum-
ftance 5 that magnets always contain their natural
quantity of fluid. Of courfe, their aCfion on iron, and
on each other, depends entirely on its unequal diftri-
bution.
The mod important part of this theory is that which
explains the induCiion of magnetifm on iron and fteel
by juxtapofition to a magnet •, but before we can
properly enter on that, we muft notice iome other
particulars refpeCting the theoretical part of our fub-
-
A very material point in magnetifm, as in eleClricity,
is to afcertain the law of aCtion, according to which this
power aCls on the particles of iron and other matter ;
and accordingly this has long been an objeft of atten¬
tion with philofophers. The difficulty of afcertaining
this law is extremely great, as will readily appear by
the following confideration.
In the aftion of two magnets on each other, as A
and B, there are four different aftions to be confidered
that a£t at the fame time, though with different de¬
grees of force, and in different directions. Thus the
north pole of A repels the north pole of B, and at¬
tracts its fouth pole, while the fouth pole of A exerts
a repulfion on the fouth pole of B, and an attraction on
its north pole. Now the force, which we attempt to
meafure, is compounded of thefe four forces ; and thefe
we cannot meafure feparately. The attraction obferved
is the excefs of two attractions that are unequal above
two unequal repulfions, and v. v. with refpeCt to the
obferved repulfion. Further, if we reflect that it is pof-
fible for a mutual aCtion to exift between every two par¬
ticles of the different magnets, and that the intenfity of
this aCtion may vary, not only at different diftanceSj
but at the fame diftance, the difficulty will be greatly
increafed.
Numerous experiments have been made with a view
of afcertaining this law\ Mr Cavallo has detailed many
of thofe made by Mufchenbroeck j but their refults are
fo anomalous, that their inaccuracy is apparent. In¬
deed, the attempt to afcertain this law by obferving
merely the attractions and repulfions, was very unphilo-
fophical. The method employed by Mr Hawkfbee and
Dr Brook Taylor, viz. obferving how far the aCtion of
a magnet made a compafs needle deviate from the meri¬
dian at different diftances, was much more fcientific, as
this deviation is occafioned by the difference of the two
fums of the fame forces j and this may be made many
times greater than the other, and muff of courfe be
much more fenfible. The fliape of the magnets em- Theory,
ployed by them was, how'ever, very improper. Some ' v
experiments made by Mr Lambert of the academy of Qf
Berlin, were very judicious. He placed a magnetic bert.
needle at various diltances from a magnet, but in the
diredion of its axis, and marked the declination from
the magnetic line produced by the aCtion of the mag¬
net, and the obliquity of the magnet to the axis of the
needle. Thus the aCtion of the magnet and the natu¬
ral polarity of the needle were placed in oppofition and
equilibrium 5 but the great difficulty was to difcover
the proportional change of thefe forces by their obli¬
quity of aCtion on this fmall lever.
Mr Lambert obferved, that when the obliquity of
the magnet to the axis of the needle was = 30®, the
needle wTas made to decline 15® •, and when the obli¬
quity wTas r= 750, the needle declined 30*. Let us call
the obliquity 0 and the declination d, and let us put f
for that funCtion of the angle which is proportional to
the aCtion. Alfo let us call the natural polarity of the
needle/>, and the force of the magnet m. Then it is
evident that /> — m y f30 ; and p \ m —
f $0 \f 15 ; and for the fame realon p : mzzf, 75 :
/ 30, and therefore/, 15 :/, 30=/ 30 :/ 75. But
fine 15 : 3orzfine 30 : j 75 ; hence Mr Lambert con¬
cluded, that the fne was that funCtion of the angle
which was proportional to the aCtion of magnetifm on
a lever. As this point, however, could not be deter¬
mined by one experiment, he compared feveral other
obliquities and declinations wdth the fame diltances, and
with different diftances of the magnet, and fully proved
that he was right in his conjeCture.
The refult of Mr Lambert’s experiments fully proves
the fallacy of the theories of impulfion, which pretend
to explain magnetic aCtion by the impelling power of a
ftream of fluid, or by preffure produced by the motion
of fuch a ftream; as in fuch a cafe the preffure on the
needle muft have diminilhed in the duplicate ratio of
the fine ; or with the angle 90° the directive power
muft; have been four times as much as with the angle
of 30°, whereas it is Ihewn by obfervation to be only
twice as much.
When Mr Lambert had afcertained the effect of ob¬
liquity, he proceeded to examine that of diftance 5 and
he found, that if w”e put f for the force of the magnet,
and 5 for the diftance of the neareft pole of the magnet
from the centre of the needle, and a for a conftant
quantity nearly equal to two thirds of the length of the
needle,/will be proportional to (3—a*).
Dr Robifen endeavoured to inveiiigate this law in a Dr Robi-
very fimple manner. He caufed to be made fome mag-Ion’sinvefti-
nets confifting of two balls conneded by a flender rod.S^1005,
By a particular mode of impregnation (which we fup-
pofe to be quenching them, after being red hot, be¬
tween two magnets) he gave them a pretty good mag¬
netifm j and the force of each pole appeared to be near¬
ly confined to the centre of the ball, which was his ob- -
jeCl in making them of fuch a fliape, as it reduced the
examination of their attraCfive and direClive power to a
very eafy computation. The refult of his experiments
was, that the force of each pole varied inverfely as the
fquares of the diftances, or at leaft the error arifing
from fuch an hypothefis was very fmall, amounting on¬
ly to one-fifteenth of the whole.

Theory. Qf a^ion, by fuppofing that tbe fun6tion of the diftance
y expreffing that law, reprefented by the ordinates of a
curve fimilar to the hyperbola, referred to its affymp-
tote as an axis, towards which its curve was of courfe
always convex. On this luppofition he explained the
attradlions and repullions of magnets nearly in. the fol¬
lowing manner.
Let there be two magnets, A and B (fig. 26.) pla-
* ced fo that their four poles, S, N, s, », may be in a
flraight line. Now, on the ftraight line O ^ take O m,
0/>, O «, O ^rrN J-, N «, Sr, S n; and let MPNQ^ be a
curve line, whofe afymptotic axis is the faid line O q.
Draw the ordinates /«M, /> P, N«, y Qto the curve, and
thefe wdll reprefent the intenfities of the forces exerted
between the poles of the magnets. The diftance be¬
tween m, n, or between f> and q zr the length of the
magnet A, and m /> or n q — that of B, and M rw, P/>,
N n and Qq, are pairs of ordinates that are equally
diftant. Now, it is eafy to fee from the figure, that in
whatever fituation the pairs of equidiftant ordinates may
be, M<7 will always exceed P/>-j-N/7, or the
fum of the attractions will be always greater than that
of the repulfions.
Let the chords MQ, PN, MP, NQ be drawn. Bi-
fe£l them in B, D, L, F, and join EF. Draw the or¬
dinates E e, Fy'j and BD b (cutting EF in C). Draw
P u parallel to the axis, cutting E e in i. Draw alfo
£) z’ parallel to the axis, cutting Fy'in <p. Alfo draw
FHL parallel to the axis, and P 0 / parallel to QN *,
and draw PL /, and ^ ex, cutting M.m in / and x.
Let each ordinate be reprefented by the letter at its in-
terfeflion with the axis. Thus, the ordinates Mw
and Qq may be reprefented by tn and q, &c. Be-
caufe MP is bifeCled in E, M / is double of E 1, M /
is double EL, and M # double of E e. Again, P/
being narallel to Q n, and P a to Q_z, t u equals
N i.
If thefe ordinates are fuppofed to reprefent the mu¬
tual aClion of the magnetic poles, their tendency to or
from each other, that is, their attra&ions or repuifions,
may be expreffed by (wz-j-f)—(ff+/)) which reprefent
the excefs of the fum of the aClions of the neareft and
moft remote poles above the fum of the aftion of the in-
I termediate diftant poles. This tendency may often be
conveniently reprefented by (zz—■/>)—(«-—y) or the ex¬
cefs of the difference of the aClions exerted by the near-
eft pole of A on the two poles of B, above the differ¬
ence of the aftions of the remote pole of A on the fame
poles of B. Now, i. If we fuppofe the diflirnilar poles
of A and B to front each other, m-\-q will reprefent

The above aCtion will be increafed by any one of
four circumftances, as, 1. By increafing the ttrength of
either magnet. 2. By leffening the diftance between
the two magnets. 3. Increafing the length of A, the
diftance between it and B remaining the fame. 4. By
increafing tbe length of B, the diftance between it and

poles front each other. Here it is evident that the or¬

ling forces of the magnets are equal to the former at- Theory,
trading forces at the fame diftances. As magnets are—y—
feldom perfed, the repelling forces are, however, ufual-
ly weaker than the attrading. 87
To explain the diredive power of magnets, Dr Ro-Explana-
86
bifon fuppofed the magnet A not to be at liberty to a.p-^.^dl*
proach B or recede from it, but to be fupported at itspowen
centre B, lb as to turn round it. Now, its fouth pole1
j being more attraded by N than it is repelled by S,
B is on tbe whole attraded by A, and by this attrac¬
tion would vibrate like a pendulum fupported at the
centre B. Again, the north pole n being repelled by
N more than it is attraded by S, will be on the whole
repelled,’ and B zz would.alfo vibrate round B. Thus B
wmuld be kept in the pofition s B, zz. This will be more
evident if w’e fuppofe the magnet B arranged at right
angles to the line AB, as in the dotted reprefentation
s' B n' j for now s' and n' are urged in oppofite con-
fpiring diredions with equal forces, which, if the mag¬
net be very fmall, will ad nearly at right angles to n' s'.
If the pofition were oblique, the forces would be fome-
what unequal j and allowances muft be made for the ob¬
liquity of the adion, that we may know the precife ro¬
tative momentum. This modification of the adion of
A on B, we call the diredive power of A ; and the mo¬
dification of B, by which it tends to or from A, we call
the polarity of B.
Now, the diredive power of A and the polarity of
B may be increafed, 1. By increafing the ftrength of
either A or B, or both j 2. By diminilhing the diftance
between A and B ; 3. By increafing the length of A;
and, 4. By diminiihing the length of B the diftance be¬
tween them remaining the fame.
We may remark, that the diredive power of A is
always greater than its attradive power, by a certain
meafure which we may reprefent by the formula

This pidure of the forces, attentively examined, will
fuggeft to the reader many interefting and inftrudive 88
particulars. Dr Robifon ufed to relate a curious and Curious'
inftrudive phenomenon that he was long puzzled t0^enomc'~
explain, refpeding the mutual adion of large magnets.
Amufing himfelf with fome experiments on magnetifm,
with two large ftrong magnets, as AB, fig. 27* which
wrere placed at about the diftance of three inches writh
their oppofite poles fronting each other, he had placed
a fmall needle balanced on a point between them as at
D, which arranged itfelf in the fame line with the mag¬
nets j but happening to fet it oft to a confiderable dif¬
tance on the table, as at F, he was furprifed to fee it
inftantly turn round on the point, and arrange itfelf in
an oppofice diredion. When brought back to D, it
reaffumed its former pofition, but when he carried it
• out gradually along the line DF, perpendicular to N s,
he found it grow fenfibly more feeble, vibrating more
ftowly ; and w’ben arrived at a certain point E, it {hew¬
ed no polarity towards either A or B, but retained any
pofition given it : but when carried farther out, it again
acquired polarity to the magnets, though in a contrary
diredion, arranging itfelf parallel to NS, with its
north pale next to N, and fouth pole next to S. Being

'JHieorv. interrupted in the profecution of this experiment, but
1 v having marked the line Dl1 on the table, he after¬
wards replaced the magnets and needle, placing the lat¬
ter at E, where he expe&ed it to be neutral; but it
now turned its north pole towards E, and did not be¬
come neutral till carried further out. When Hand¬
ing there, fomething happened to move the mag¬
nets A and B, which inltantly rulhed together, and
at the fame inftant the needle turned itfelf brilkly,
and arranged itfelf as before at F. In Ihort, by gra¬
dually withdrawing the magnets from each other, he
found that the needle firft became weaker, then neu¬
tral, and then turned into the oppofite pofition.
Dr Rmbifon explained this curious phenomenon by
what he calls primary and fecondary magnetic curves, >
fuch as NHM, NEL, and SGK, SEI; but our limits
do not permit us to enter here on the inveftigation of
thefe curves.
Law of ac- From all Dr Robifon’s experiments and calculations,
tion proba- he appears to have been fully convinced, that the true
ij}- law of magnetic adlion is in the inverfe duplicate ratio
'thTfquares °f t-ie di/lances, and his opinion is Hill farther llrengthen-
"of'ihe di- ed by the ingenious experiments of M. Coulomb related
fiances- jn the Memoirs of the Academy of Sciences at Pans
for 1786 and 1787, or the Jour, de Phy. vol. xliii.
We are now prepared to examine the indudlion of
magnetifm in iron or Heel by juxtapofition to a magnet,
the general facts of which are mentioned and illuftrated
in N° 44.
It was remarked in N° 46, that the induction of mag-
netifm in the iron by being near a magnet was not pro¬
duced by a transference of fomething from the magnet
to the iron. It follows that there mult be fome inhe¬
rent property in iron, which is only excited, as it were,
or foufed into adtion, by the proximity of the magnet.
It has been remarked, that the magnetifm of iron is
momentary, but this muft be underllood only of the
fineft and purell: iron, as when this metal is in the Hate
of ore, or has undergone any change, as by expofure to
-the air, or by cementation, its magnetifm becomes
permanent, in proportion to the hardnefs of the me-
o ta^'
Induced It is great importance to obferve that the acquifi-
magnetifm tion of induced magnetifm is gradual and progreflive,
gradual. an(j that this gradation is more perceptible according as
the iron is in a harder Hate. In foft iron the induftion
appears to be inftantaneous throughout, unlefs the bar
be exceedingly long ; but when a magnet is brought
near a bar of tempered Heel, the near end acquires a
contrary polarity long before the remote end appears
affefted, and it is a long time before the remote end
acquires the fame polarity with the proximate end of
the magnet.
From what has been faid we may infer, that a piece
tracled on- of iron brought near a magnet, is attrafted only be-
ly becaufe caufe it becomes magnetical by indu6lion, and that
n becomes attraftion of a loadftone for iron, or the tendency
of iron to the loadflone, is the confequence of the pro¬
per difpofition of the magnetifm induced in the iron.
It has already appeared, that this phenomenon arifes
from the excefs of two attraflions above two repulfions,
and this is farther proved by the following conlidera-
tions : 1. That the magnetifm of the two poles is evi¬
dently of an oppolite nature, the one attra&ing what
the other repels, and vice verfa. If a piece of iron is
'Vol. XII. Part I.

attracted by one, it ought therefore to be repealed by
the other ; but each pole, by inducing on the near end
of the iron a magnetifm oppolite to its own, and on the
remote end a limilar magnetifm, and its aclion dinn-
niihing as the diitance increafes, the attraction mult al¬
ways be in excefs, and the iron mutt on the whole be
attracted. 2. When we have two magnets placed in a
parallel pofition, with their oppofite poles together,
if a piece of common iron be brought near their ex¬
tremities, the different poles counteradting each other,
the piece of iron will not be fupported by the two mag¬
nets together, unlefs there is an inequality of adtion }
but it is evident that either of them alone would be
capable of fupporting the iron. 3. In all the cafes
where the indudtion of magnetiim is flowg the attradlion
is proportionally weak, and the attradlion increafes ex-
adliy according to the incredfe of the progrellive in*
dudlion. 4. An ore of iron that is not capable of ac¬
quiring magnetifm, is not attradled by the magnet, and
on the other hand it is an univerfal fadl, that no fub-
ftance which is not attradled by the magnet, can be
rendered magnetical.
The indudlion of magnetifm by juxtapofition affords Arrange-
a complete explanation of the curious arrangement of ment of
iron filings round a magnet. Let us fuppofe a greaW^^G*
many fmall oblong pieces of iron to be lying near each6 P ^
other on the furfase of mercury, and that a ftrong
magnet be brought into the midit of them. T hey are
all immediately rendered magnetical by indudlion ; any
one that is neareft the north pole of the magnet acquiring
two poles, one a north and the other a fouth pole, turns
the fouth pole towards the north pole of the magnet,
and the north pole away from it*, a fimilar effedl is pro¬
duced on another piece or filing that lies near the firtt,
and fo on of the reft. All thofe that lie near each
other muft mutually attradl, as the magnetifm of each
is fo difpofed that both ends of it are in a ftate of at¬
tradlion towards one or other of its neighbours. They
will therefore arrange themfelves by coalefcence in a
particular manner 3 if they are near enough, they will
unite by th^ir extremities, and if they are at fome di- ■
ftance they will point towards each other, forming
curved lines.
It is found that the magnetifm of magnets, whether Magnetifm
natural or artificial, is continually tending to decay, can be re-
Now as we find that this magnetifm may be induced verGfi*
merely by the approach of a magnet, and as wre know
that in producing magnetifm, magnets may oppofe each
other, it is reafonable to conclude, that when a fiight
though permanent magnetifm has been acquired by a
piece of iron by its vicinity to a magnet, it may be
deftroyed, and the contrary magnetifm induced, by
applying a magnet in the oppofite diredtion. Accord¬
ingly it is a well-known fadl, that the poles of magnets
made of foft fteel can be reverfed at pleafure.
This explains why magnetic repulfion is always
weaker than attradlion at the fame diftance, as magnets,
when placed with their fimilar poles fronting each
other, in order to try their repulfion, are thereby weak¬
ened ; whereas, on the contrary, magnets applied with
their oppofite poles, fo as to attradl each other, are
thereby improved, and their attradlive powers are
made to appear greater than they really are.
It has been obferved that a magnet is not weakened
by inducing magnetifm on iron. In fadl, it is rather

improved hy fuch ir dcdtidr, and this will increafe he
effedl j for as the magnet is improved, the induced
niagnetifm of the iron will be thereby increafe'd, and
thus the magnet will be thus fanner improved.
After what has been faid, we need not enter further
into an explanation of the phen-rfiena, or of the pro-
defies employed in making artificial magnets. They
are all referable to this one fa£l of the indu&uwi of
magnetifm by juxt-ipofition, and explanations will readi-
1y fuggefl themfelves to readers who carefully confider
the preceding faffs, and compare them with Dr Gil¬
bert’s theory of terrefirial magnetifm.
It is now time for us to return to Dr Gilbert’s hypo-
thefis, and confider an objection that has been ftrongly
urged again!! it.
There is ©bferved no tendency in the magnetic needle
towards thegreat terreflrial magnet, that is, though, when
made to float on water, it fpeedily acquires direflive
power, it does not in thefe latitudes approach the north
fide of the veffel, nor does an iron bar appear heavier
when its fouth pole is uppermoft, as ought to be the
cafe on account of the attraction of the great magnet.
Dr Gilbert faw this objection, and it appears to have
given him fome concern, fie attempted to get rid of
it by obferving that the directive power of a magnet is
greater than its attraffive force ; a faft in fupport of
which he brings many experiments. A much more
iatisfaflory anfwer may be derived from what has been
Hated refpefting the actions of the four poles. We
thence find, that tl^e polarity of the needle depends on
the difference of the Jt/rns of the affions of each pole of
the magnet on both poles of the needle *, whereas its
tendency towards the magnet arifing from the attraftion
between them, depends on the difference of the differ¬
ences of the fame aftions. Hence the former may be
very great while the latter is very fmall. We find
that fmall iron filings are much lefs forcibly attrafted
by magnets than coarfe ;Ones, and, if we confider
that the largeft magnets which we employ do not bear
lo great a proportion to the earth, as the fineft iron fil¬
ings to an ordinary magnet, we {hall not wonder that
the attraftive power of the earth is not very fenfible.
As this objection is one ot the ftrongeft that can be
brought againft the theory, and as wTe may confider
this as done away, we may now receive the theory as
juft fo far as it goes. We muft remark, that though
we call that pole of a magnet which inclines towards
the earth in the northern latitudes, a north pole, it is
properly fpeaking a fouth pole ; for as we muft call
that pole of the great magnet the north pole which is
in the north, and as this pole produces the contrary
polarity in the proximate end of a needle, that end muit
be poiTeffed offouth polarity. We fhall return to this
fubjeCt in the article Variation.
Some valuable obfervations on terreftrial magnetifm
have lately been made in France by M. M. Humboldt
and Biot, and as they would fuffer materially by a-
bridgement, we ihall prefent our readers wfith the great-
eft part of the memoir nearly as tranflated in the Philo-
fophieal Magazine, vol. xxii.
After explaining the objeCt of the memoir, and
giving an account of the fhare that he had in conduct¬
ing the obfervations, M. Biot proceeds as follows.
It is neceffary to confider the aCtion of terreftrial

ing to the different claffes of the phenomena which it
produces. 96
It we confider it firft in general, we find that it ^f£net'j'ni
aCts on the whole furface of the globe, and that it ex- vvhoteVur-
tends beyond it. This faCt, which Was doubted, has face of the
been lately proved by M. Guy-Luffac, during his two globe,
aeroftatic voyages. And if thefe obfervations, made
with all the care poflible, have not {hewn the leaf! fen¬
fible diminution in the intenfity of the magnetic force,
at the greateft height to which man can attain, we have
a right to conclude that this force extends to an inde¬
finite diitance from the earth, where it decreafes, per¬
haps, in a very rapid manner, but which at prelent is un¬
known to us.
If we now confider magnetifm at the furface even
of the earth, we fhall find three grand claffes of pheno¬
mena which it is neceffary to ftudy feparately, in order
to have a complete knowledge <~.f its mode of aCtion.
Thefe phenomena are, the declination of the magnetic
needle, its inclination, and the intenfity-of the magne¬
tic force, confidered either comparatively in different
places or in themfelves, paying attention to the varia¬
tions which they experience. It is thus that, after
having difeovered the aftion of gravity as a central
force, its variation, refulting from the figure of the
earth, was afterwards afeertained in different latitudes.
The declination of the magnetic needle appears . to
be that phenomenon which hitherto has more particular¬
ly fixed the attention of philofophers, on account, no
doubt, of the affifiance which they hoped to derive
from it in determining the longitude j but when it was
known that the declination changes in the fame place,
in the courfe of time, when its diurnal variations were
remarked, and its irregular traverfing occafioned by
different meteors, in a word, the difficulty of obferving
it at fea, within one degree nearly, it was neceffary to
abandon that hope, to confider the caufe of thefe phe¬
nomena as much more complex and abftrufe than had
been at firft imagined. ^
In regard to the intenfity of the magnetic power Magnetic
in different parts of the earth, it has never yet been Power h1'
meafured in a comparative manner. The obfervations
of M. Humboldt on this fubjedt have difeovered a very eqUator to
remarkable phenomenon 5 it is the variation of the in- the poles,
tenfity in different latitudes, and its increafe proceeding
from the equator to the poles.
The compafs, indeed, which gt. the departure of
M. Humboldt gave at Paris 245 ofcillations in 10 mi¬
nutes, gave no more in Peru than 211, and it conftantly
varied in the fame dire£tion 5 that is to fay, the num¬
ber of the ofcillations always decreafed in approaching
the equator, and always increafed in advancing towards
the north.
Thefe differences cannot be aferibed to a diminu¬
tion of the force in the magnetifm of the compafs, nor
can we fuppofe that it is weakened by the effb£t of time
and of heat $ for after three years refidence in the
warmeft countries of the earth, the fame compafs gave
again in Mexico ofcillations as rapid as at Paris.
There is no reafon to doubt the juftnefs of M.
Humboldt’s obfervations, for he often obferved the
ofcillatiohs in the vertical plane perpendicular to that
meridian j and by decompofing the magnetic force in

the latter plane, and comparing it with its total aftion,
which is exercifed in the former, we may from thefe
data calculate its direction, and confequently the di-
redtion of the needle (c). This inclination, thus calcu¬
lated, is found always conformable to that which M.
Humboldt obferved diredtly. When he made his ex¬
periments, however, he could not forefee that they
would be fubje&ed to this proof by which M. Laplace
verified them.
As the juftnefs of thefe obfervations cannot be
contefted, we muft allow alfo the truth of the refult
which they indicate, and which is the increafe of the
magnetic force proceeding from the equator to the
poles.
s To follow thefe refults with more facility, it will
be proper to fet out from a fixed term j and it appears
natural to make choice for that purpofe of the points
where the inclination of the magnetic needle is null,
becaufe they feem to indicate the places where the op-
pofite adlion of the two terreftrial hemifpheres is equal.
The feries of thefe points forms on the furface of the
earth a curved line, wThich differs very fenfibly from the
terreftrial equator, deviating from it to the fouth of tne
Atlantic ocean, and to the north in the fouth fea. M.
Humboldt found this equator in Peru about 7® 1' S.
Tat. which for that part of the earth places it nearly
in the fpot where Wilke and Temounier had fixed it.
The places fituated to the north of that point may
be divided into four zones, the three firft of which, be¬
ing nearer the equator, are about 40 of latitude, while
the latter, more extenfive and more variable, is 14 .
So that the fyftem of thefe zones extends in America
from the magnetic equator to 230 of north latitude,
and comprehends in longitude an interval of about
5°°.
The firft zone extends from 70 i' of fouth lati¬
tude to 2° 54'. The mean number of the ofcillations
of the needle in the magnetic meridian in 10' of time
is there 211,9 : no obfervation gives lefs than 211, or
more than 214. From M. Humboldt’s obfervations
©ne might form a fimilar zone on the fouth fide of
the magnetic equator, which would give the fame re-
fults.
The fecond zone extends from 2® 13' of fouth la-
30 15' of north latitude. The mean term of
E T I S M.
titude to j -j     -
the ofcillations is there 217.9: they are never below
220, nor above 226.
The fourth zone, broader than the other two, ex¬
tends from 90 15' to 23° 8' of north latitude. Its
mean term is 237 : it never prefents any obfervation be¬
low 229, nor above 240.
We are unacquainted, in regard to this part of
the earth with the intenfity of the magnetic force be¬
yond the latitude of 230 north ; and on the other hand,
in Europe, where we have obfervations made in high
latitudes, we have none in the neighbourhood of the
equator j but we will not venture to compare thefe two
claffes of obfervations, which may belong to different
fyItems of forces, as will be mentioned hereafter.
However, the only comparifon of refults, collected
in America by M. Humboldt, appears to us to efta-
blifh with certainty the increafe of the magnetic force
from the equator to the poles ■, and, without w'ifhing to
connect them too clofely with the experiments made in
Europe, wTe mult remark, that the latter accord fo far
alfo with the preceding as to indicate the phenomenon.
If w7e have thus divided the obfervations into zones
parallel to the equator, it is in order that we may more
eafily (hew the truth of the fa£t which refults from
them, and in particular to render the demonftration in¬
dependent of thofe fmall anomalies which are inevitably
mixed with thefe refults.
Though thefe anomalies are very trifling, they are
however, fo fenfible, and fo frequently occur, that,
they cannot be aferibed entirely to errors in the obfer¬
vations. It appears more natural to aferibe them to tne
influence of local circurhftances, and the particular at¬
tractions exercifed by collections of ferruginous mat¬
ters, chains of mountains, or by the large mafies of the
continents.
One of them, indeed, having carried to the Alps the
magnetic needle employed in an aerial excuriion, he
found that its tendency to return to the magnetic meri¬
dian was conftantly ftronger in thefe mountains than it
was at Paris before his departure, and than it has been
found fince his return. 1 his needle, which made at
Paris 83.9° in io' of time, has varied in the following
manner in the different places to which it was carried.

fch Let HOC (fie. 2S.) be the plane of the magnetic meridian pafling through the vertical OC ; let OL be
tlm direftion of the needle fituated in that plane, and OH a horizontal. The angle LOH will be the inclina¬
tion of the needle, which we Ihall denote by I. If F reprefent the total magnetic force which afts in the di-
reftion OL, the part of this force which ads according to OC, will be F fine of I : but the magnetic orces
which determine the ofcillations of the needle in any plane, are to each other as the fquares of the olcillations
made in the fame time. If we denote them by M, the number of ofcillations made m 10 of time m the magnetic

Thefe experiments were made with the greateft
care, conjointly with excellent obfervers, and always
employing the fame watch verified by frnall pendulums,
and taking the mean terms between feveral feriefes of
obfervations, which always differed very little from
each other. It appears thence to refult, that the adfion
of the Alps has a fenfible influence on the intenfity of
the magnetic force. M. Humboldt obferved analo¬
gous effedls at the bottom of the Pyrenees; for example,
at Perpignan. It is not improbable that they arofe-
from the mafs of thefe mountains, or the ferruginous
matters contained in them; but whatever may be the
caufe, it is feen by thefe examples that the general
aiffion of terreffrial magnetifm is fenfibly modified by
local circumftances, the differences of which may be
perceived in places very little diftant from each other.
4 his truth will be further confirmed by the following
obfervations. ,
It is to caufes of this kind, no doubt, that we muff
£ifcribe the diminution of the magnetic forces obferved
in fome mountains 5 a diminution which, on the firff
view, might appear contrary to the refults obtained du¬
ring various aerial voyages. This conjecture is fupported
by feveral obfervations of M. Humboldt. By making
his needle to ofcillate on the mountain of Guadeloupe,
which rifes 338 toifes above Santa-Fe, he found it in
Io' of time give two ofcillations lefs than in the plain.
At Silla, near Caracas, at the height of 1316 toifes
above' the coaft, the diminution went fo far as five of-
cillations 5 and on the other hand, on the volcano of
Antifana, at the height of 2467 toifes, the number of
ofcillations in 10 minutes was 230 ; though at Quito
it was only 218, which indicates an increafe of inten¬
fity. A fimilar effecff was obferved on the fummit of
Mount Genevre, at the height of 800 or 900 toifes, as
may be feen from the numbers already given ; and on
this mountain M. Biot found the greateft intenfity of
the magnetic force. He faw on the hill of La Super-
ga, in the neighbourhood of Turin, an example of
thefe variations equally ftriking. Obferving, with Vaf-
fali, on this hill, at the elevation of 300 toifes, they
found 87 ofcillations in 10 minutes of time. On the
fide of the hill they had 88.8 ofcillations, and at the
bottom, on the bank of the Po, they’ obtained 87.3.
Though thefe refults approach very near to each other,
their difference is, however, fenfible, and fully ftiews
that their fmall variations muft be confidered as flight
anomalies produced by local circumftances.
This examination leads us to confider the intenfity of
magnetifm on the different points of the furface of the
globe, as, fubjecff to two forts of differences. One kind
are general *, they depend merely on the fituation of the
places in regard to the magnetic equator, and belong to
a general phenomenon,, which is the increafe of the in-
E T I S M. Chap. 11 r.
tenfity of the magnetic forces in proportion as we re- Theory,
move from the equator ; the other kind of variations, ~—v——'
which are much fmaller and altogether irregular, feem
to depend entirely on local circumftances, and modify
either more or lefs the general refults.
If we confider terreftrial magnetifm as the effeft of
an attractive force inherent in all the material particles
of t.'j globe, or only in fome of thefe particles, which
■we are far from determining, the general lav/ will be,
the total refult of the fyftem of attraffion of all the par¬
ticles, and the fmall anomalies will be produced by the
particular attraftions of the partial fyftems of the mam.
netic moleculae diffufed irregularly around each' poiinj
attractions rendered more fenfible by the diminution of
the diftance.
It now remains to confider the inclination of the
magnetic needle in regard to the horizontal plane. It
has been long known that this inclination is not every
where the fame ; in the northern hemifphere the needle
inclines towards the north ; in the fouthern towards the
fouth ; the places where it becomes horizontal form
the magnetic equator j and thofe where the inclination
is equal, but not null, form on each fide of that equa¬
tor curved lines, to which the name of magnetic paral¬
lels has been given, from their analogy to the terreftri¬
al parallels. One may fee in feveral works, and parti¬
cularly in that of Lemounier, entitled Lois du Magne-
tif/ne, the figure of thefe parallels, and their difpofition
on the face of the earth. roo
It evidently refults from this difpofition, that the Inclination
inclination is in proportion as we recede from the magne- ^ ^
tic equator j but the law which it follows in its increafe, creWs Ts"
has not yet, as far as appears to us, been given. To we proceed
afeertain this law, however, would be of great utility 5fro:ri 1:116
for the inclination feems to be the moft conftant of aHmagnet^c
the magnetic phenomena, and it exhibits much fewer effaator
anomalies than the intenfity. Befides, if any rule well
confirmed could be difeovered on this fubjeft, it might
be employed with advantage at fea to determine the la¬
titude, when the weather does not admit an obfervation
of the fun; which is the cafe in various places during
the greater part of the year. We have fome reafon to
expeft this application, when we fee the delicacy of
that indication in the obfervations of M. Humboldt,
where we find 35' 6" of difference between two towns
fo near each other as Nifmes and Montpellier. Thefe
motives have induced us to ftudy with great intereft the
feries of obfervations made by M. Humboldt in regard
to the inclination $ and it appears to us that they may
be reprefented very exactly by a mathematical hypothe-
fis, to which we are far from attaching any reality in it-
felf, but which we offer merely as a commodious and
fure mode of connefting the refults.
To difeover this law, we muft firft exaffly deter¬
mine the polition of the magnetic equator, which is as
an intermediate line between the northern and the
fouthern inclinations. For this purpofe we have the
advantage of being able to compare two direft obferva*
tions, one of La Peroufe, and the other of M. Hum¬
boldt. The former found the magnetic equator on the
coafts of Brafil at io° sf of fouth latitude, and 250 25'
of weft longitude, counted from the meridian of Paris.
The latter .found the fame equator in Peru at 70 1' of
fouth latitude, and 8o° 41' of weft longitude, alfo rec¬
koning from the fame meridian. Thefe data are fuffi-

cient to calculate tire portion of the magnetic equator,
fuppofjng it to be a great circle of the terreftrial fphere;
an hypothefis which appears to be conformable to ob-
fervations. The inclination of this plane to the ferref-
trial equator is thus found to be equal to lo° 58' 56",
and its occidental node on that equator is at 1 20° 2' 5"
weft from Paris, which places it a little beyond the
continent of America, near the Galhpagos, in the South
fea ; the other node is at 590 57'' 55" to the eaft of Pa¬
ris, which places it in the Indian feas. (d)
“ We do not give this determination as rigoroufly
exa£t; fome corre£!ions might no doubt be made to it,
had we a greater number of obfervations equally pre-
cifej but we are of opinion that thefe corre&ions would
be very fmall, and it will be feen afterwards that, in¬
dependently of the confidence which the two obferva¬
tions w’e have employed deferve, we have other reafons
for entertaining this opinion, (e)
“ It is very remarkable that this determination of
the magnetic equator agrees almoft perfeftly with that
given long ago by Wilke and Lemounier. The latter
in particular, vcho for want of direft obfervations
had difcufled a great number of correfponding ob¬
fervations, indicates the magnetic equator in Peru-to¬
wards 70 20' of fouth latitude, and M. Humboldt found
it in the fame place at 7° befides, Lemounier’s
chart, as well as that of M. Wilke, indicates for the
inclination of the magnetic meridian about ii°, and
they place the node about 140° of weft longitude, rec¬
koned from the meridian of Paris.
“ Can it be by chance, then, that thefe elements,
found more than 40 years ago, fhould accord fo well
with ours founded on recent obfervations ? or does the
inclination of the magnetic equator experience only
very fmall variations, while all the other fymptoms of
terreftrial magnetifm change fo rapidly ? We fhould
not be far from admitting the latter opinion, when w’e Theo
confider that the inclination of the magnetic needle has v“
changed at Paris 30 in 60 years fince it has been ob-
ferved *, and that at London, according to the obferva¬
tions of Mr Graham, it has not changed 2° in 200
years, while the declination has varied more than 20°
in the fame interval, and has paffed from eaft to wTeft :
but on the other hand the obfervation of the inclination
is fo difficult to be made with exadtnefs, and it is fa.
ffiort a time fmce the art of meafuring it with pre-
cifion was known, that it is perhaps more prudent to
abftain from any premature opinion on phenomena, the
caufe of which is totally unknown to us.”
To employ the other obfervations of M. Hum¬
boldt in regard to the inclination, the terreftrial lati¬
tudes and longitudes reckoned from the magnetic equa¬
tor were firft reduced. The latter, being reckoned from
the node of that equator in the South fea, M. Biot firft
perceived by thefe calculations that the pofition of that
plane determined by preceding refearches was pretty
exadl 5 for fome of the places, fuch as Santa-Fe and
Javita, wffiere M. Humboldt obferved inclinations almoft:
equal, were found nearly on the magnetic parallel, though
diftant from each other more than 6o° of longitude.
When thefe reductions were made, M. Biot en¬
deavoured to reprefent the figns of the inclinations ob¬
ferved, and to leave as little to chance as poffible. He
firft tried a mathematical hypothefis conformable enough
to the idea which has hitherto been entertained in re¬
gard to terreftrial magnetifm.
He fuppofed in the axis of the magnetic equator,
and at an equal diftance from the centre of the earth,
twTo centres of attraftive forces, the one auftral and the
other boreal, in fuch a manner as to reprefent the two
oppofite magnetic poles of the earth. He then calcu¬
lated the effeift which ought to refult from the adfion
of
(d) To calculate this pofition, let NEE' (fig. 29.) be the terreftrial equator j NHL the magnetic equator,
fuppofed alfo to be a great circle, and HL the two points of that equator, obferved by Meffrs Humboldt and
La Peroufe. The latitudes HE, LE', and the arc EE', which is the difference of longitude of thefe two points,
is known : confequently, if we fuppofe HE=£, LE'—EE'=^, EN~.r, and the angle ENHzrr/, we lhall
have two fpherical triangles NEH, NE'L, which will give the twm following equations:

(e) La Peroufe, after having doubled Cape Horn, fell in a fecond time with the magnetic equator in 18' north
latitude, and 1190 7' of longitqde weft from Paris. He was therefore very near the node of the magnetic equa¬
tor, fuch as we have deduced it from obfervations. This fa£t eftablilhes in a pofitive manner two important con-
fequences : Firft, that the preceding determinations require only very flight corredlions; and the fecond, that tho
magnetic equator is really a great circle of the eartbj if not exaftly, at leaft very nearly.

making their attractive force reciprocally vary as the
fquare of the diftance \ and in this manner he obtain¬
ed the direction of the rel’ult of their forces, which
ought to be that alfo of the magnetic needle in that
latitude.
He fuppofes that the point B (fig. 30.) is the north
magnetic pole of the earth, and that the point A is the
fouth magnetic pole •, he fuppofes alfo that there is in
the point M, at the furface of the earth, a molecula
of the auftral fluid which is attra&ed by B and repel¬
led by A in the inverfe ratio of the fquare of the di-
ffance j and he requires wrhat will be the direction of
the power refulting from thefe two forces aCting on
that molecula. It is evident that this direction will be
that alfo w'hich would be affumed in the point M by
the needle of a compafs freely fufpcnded ; for, in con-
fequence of the fmallnefs of the needle in ccmparifcn of
the radius of the earth, the lines drawn from its points
to one centre, B or A, may be confidered as parallel,
efpecially if the points A and B are near the centre of
the earth, which is the cafe with nature, as may be
feen.
Pie firft fuppofes that the earth has a fpherical fi¬
gure, and that the two poles A and B are equal in
force, and he then examines how far the latter fuppofi-
tion agrees with the refults obferved.

Thefe equations determine the diredion of the mag¬
netic needle in regard to each point M, the diftance
of which from the magnetic equator is known; but it
is feen that this direftion depends on the quantity K,
which reprefents the diftance of the magnetic centres
from the centre of the earth •, this diftance being ex-
prelfed in parts of the terreftrial radius, w’e muft there¬
fore firft determine this quantity from obfervations.
To do it in the manner of approximation, and thus
acquire a firft idea of the value of K, M. Biot chofe
an obfervation made by M. Humboldt at Carichana in
6° 3 4' 5" of north latitude counted from the terreftrial
equator, and 70° 18' weft longitude reckoned from the
meridian of Paris, which gives 140 52' 25" of longitude
counted from the magnetic equator, and 48° 51' 53'' of
weft longitude, proceeding from the node formed by that
equator wfith the equator of the earth. PAe inclina¬
tion of the magnetic needle was obferved in that place
by M. Humboldt in the month of Mefildor, year 8,
and found to be, equal to 33,78° of the centigrade divi-
fion. A comparifon of this refult with the other ob¬
fervations of M. Humboldt, (hew's that it may indeed
be confidered as agreeing to that latitude.
3
To make ufe of it, M. Biot fucceffively gave to K
different values in the formula; he calculated the in¬
clinations refulting from that latitude ; and comparing
thefe refults with that which M. Humboldt really ob¬
ferved, the progrefs of the errors naturally led him to
the moft proper fuppofition. The following is a table
of thefe trials.

The firfl: value of K would place the centre of the
magnetic forces at the furface of the earth and the
poles of the magnetic equator. It is feen that this lup-
pofition cannot be admitted, becaufe it would give ah
increafe of inclination much lefs rapid than that indi¬
cated by obfervations. The cafe is the fame with the

Theyry. following refults, which place the centres of aftion on
the terreftrial radius at different diftances from the
centre of the earth j but it is feen alfo in general, that
they approach more and more to the truth in proportion
as this didance becomes lefs j which evidently {hew7s
that the two centres of action of the magnetic forces
are fituated near the centre of the earth. All the other
obfervations of M. Humboldt would alfo lead to the
fame confequence. r
The molt proper fuppolition 'would be to make Iv
•null, or fo fmall that it w'ould he needlefs*to pay atten¬
tion to it 5 which amounts to the fame thing as to con-
fider the tw'o-centres of a&ion placed, as we may fay,
in the fame molecula. The refult, indeed, obtained in
this manner is the moft exaft of all •, it is =31.0843° \
this value is ftill a little lefs than that which M. Hum¬
boldt obferved, and the difference is =2.69 ; but it
muff be confidered alfo that the formula from which
we derive thefe values fuppofes the pofition of the mag¬
netic equator is perfeftly determined ; but it may not
be fo with the utmoff exa&nefs, according to the two
only obfervations of La Peroufe and Humboldt, which
we have employed. It is therefore by ftudying the
progrefs of the formula, and comparing it with the ob¬
fervations, that we are able to appreciate it juflly j af¬
ter w7hich wTe may think of remedying the fmall errors
with wntich it may be accompanied.
To obtain the refult here mentioned, and which is,
as it were, the limit of all thofe w'hich may be obtained
by giving to K different values, it is to be remarked
that the quantity

(I-f 2K cof. 0-f K*)^—(I—2K cof. w-l-K2)*
becomes — when K is null; but by applying to it the
o
methods of known quantities, it will be found that its
value in this fuppofition is really determinate and
=  L__. By fubftituting this in the formula we

fin. m
which will eafily give the value of and when this
value is known, we (hall have the inclination I, by the
following formula :
1= IOO-}-W—/3,
which will ferve throughout the whole extent of the
two hemifpheres.
From the progrefs thus traced out, it is feen that the
preceding formula is not merely an empyric confiruc-
tion of obfervations on the contrary, it is totally in¬
dependent, and only fuppofes the inclination of the
E T I S M.
magnetic needle to be produced by a magnet infinitely
fmall, placed in the centre of the terreftrial furface ;
but by calculating from this formula the inclination for
the different latitudes, M. Biot found precifely the
fame numbers as M. Humboldt obferved either in Eu*
rope or America j and it is not his obfervations only
that are reprefented in this manner j but thofe which
have been made in Ruffia, and at Kola in Lapland,
during the laft tranfit of Venus, are alfo comprehended
under the fame law.
It is feen that the refults of the formula deviate very
little from the obfervations ; but thefe difference*; may
be rendered ftill fmaller. By examining, indeed, the
progrefs of the errors, it is feen that the numbers given
by calculation are a little too fmall in America for the
low latitudes, and a little too great for the high lati¬
tudes, which {hews that the whole may be allowed,
with fome flight modifications, either by changing,,
however little, the node and inclination of the magne¬
tic equator, which two obfervations cannot determine
with the utmoft exaftnefs, or by difplacing ever fo
little our fmall magnet, leaving, however, its centre
in the plane of the magnetic equator, and placing it in
fuch a manner that it {hall be a little nearer America
than Europe. It is by thefe obfervations themfelves,
wEen we {hall have a greater number, that wre muft be
guided in thefe fmall corredlions.
In a wmrd, it muft; not be expefted that we can re-
prefent in a rigorous manner, by a mathematical law,
all the inclinations obferved 5 for the phenomenon of
the inclination, though more regular than the other
magnetic effects, is not free from fome anomalies; this
tnay be eafily feen on conftrufling the curve given by
the obfervations themfelves. Thus, for example, the
inclination obferved at Popayan is o° 10' greater than
at St Carlos del Rio Negfo, though the magnetic la¬
titude of the latter is 30 7' greater. The cafe is the.
fame v.'ith obfervations made at Javita and Santa Fe.
Other anomalies are difcovered in the comparative pro¬
grefs of the obfervations and formula. This is the cafe
in regard to Carichana, St Thomas de la Guyane, and
Carthagena. The increafe of the inclination from the
firft to the fecond of thefe points is by no means in har¬
mony with the increafe from the fecond to the third ;
and if we compare together the intenfities obferved in
thefe different places, the anomalies they exhibit an¬
nounce in fome meafure thofe which the inclination
ough*. to experience.
The caufe of tbefe anomalies becomes evident from
what has been already remarked 5 they are merely the
effetft of local circura(lances, and arife from the fmall
fyftems of attraefion by which the general phenomena
are modified. This muft be fenfible in particular for
that part of America which M. Humboldt travelled
over, and which is traverfed throughout its whole
length by the grand chain of the cordillera of the An¬
des. It is alfo in thefe places that the mod confider-
able differences exiit. Popayan, for example, is fitaat-
ed near the volcanoes of Sotara and Pourace ; it is
joined to bafaltic mountains abounding with magnetic
iron. Near Sulumito, to the eaft of Popayan, thefe
bafaltic columns have very linking poles : in like man¬
ner Mexico is fituated at the height of 1160 toifes on
the ridge of the grand cordillera of Lenfchlitlan 5 the
ground there is covered with porous bafaltes and amyg¬
daloid s.
s
M A G N E
daloids, wliicli ara almofi; all charged with magnetic
iron. Muft not all thefe caufes have a fenfible influ¬
ence on the inclination of the magnetic needle 5 and
muft not the different difpofitions of the ferruginous
maffes. Or their change of ftate, in confequence of the
adlicn of nature, produce alfo variations ? M. Hum¬
boldt made on this point a decifive obfervation : the
earthquake of the 4th of November 1799 changed at
Cumana the inclination of the needle. On the iff of
November it was 430 65'; on the 7th it was only 420
75', and ten months after it returned t© 42° 85', but
it did «ot regain its former value ; the intenfity of the
magnetic force was not changed by the effedt of this
earthquake.
It is proved, then, by thefe obfervations, that local
circumftances may have on the inclination a fenflble in¬
fluence 3 and this influence is remarked in the countries
traverfed by M. Humboldt.
It appears, therefore, that the mathematical hypo-
thefis which we have employed really exprefles the
law of nature, at leaf! to the north of the magnetic
equator ; for, though the firft refults obferved towards
the fouth feem to bend to it alfo, the uncertainty under
which we are, in regard to the true caufe of tHefe phe¬
nomena mufl. flop our conjedlures, and prevent us from
extending too far the confequences of the laws which
we obferve (f).
From the preceding refults, we may calculate the
points where the axis of the magnetic equator pierces
the terreftrial furface 3 for their latitudes are equal to
the complements of the obliquity of that equator, and
their meridian is at ioo° of longitude from its nodes.
The north magnetic pole is found alfo at 790 T4" of
north latitude, and at 30° 2' 5" of longitude weft from
Paris, which places it to the north of America. The
other magnetic pole, fymmetric to the preceding, is
lituated in the fame latitude fouth, and at 149° 67' 5$"
of longitude eaft from Paris, which places it amidft the
eternal ice 3 indications entirely analogous to thofe of
Wilke and Lemounier.
If we could reach thefe poles, the cortipafs would
be feen vertical 3 but if any confidence can be placed
in the law which we have difcovered, this wmuld be the
only difference which wrould be obferved in regard to
the inclination, and we ftiould be ftill as far diftant
as in Europe from the real centres which produce
it. This refult might appear to be of fuch a nature
as to diminifti the intereft one might have in vifi-
ting thefe horrid regions, had we not alfo the hope
of difcovering there new phenomena in regard to the
intenfity of the magnetic force, and the influence of me¬
teors.
Thefe confequences do not entirely accord with the
opinion pretty generally received, and which afcribes
T I S M. Chap. III.
the increafe of the magnetic effects towards the north Theory.
to the great quantity of iron difperfed throughout thefe'—'“'T  
regions 3 but it appears to us that this opinion is not
agreeable to the truth. The cordillera of the Andes
contains an enormous quantity of magnetic iron 3 the
native iron of Chaco, that problematic naafs analogous to
that of Pellas, and thofe of Nacatares in Mexico, is
found even under the tropics.
On feeing the inclinations of the compafs fo exafily
reprefented in the hypothefis, they endeavoured to dif-
cover whether it could be applied to the intenlities ob¬
ferved by M. Humboldt 5 but they found that it did not
apply. It gives indeed, an increafe of the magnetic
forces from the equator to the pole ; but this increafe,
which at firft is too flow, becomes afterwards too rapid.
M. Biot has not yet been able to try whether the fmall
difplacement of the terreftrial magnet will contribute
towards reprefenting them better 3 but it muft be re¬
marked, that the feries of the intenfities is extremely
whimfical, and contains an infinite number of anoma¬
lies, fo that local phenomena may have on this pheno¬
menon a much more fenfible influence than on the in¬
clination.
On reviewing the refults which have been given, it is
feen that we have firft determined the pofition of the
magnetic equator by direct obiervations, which had
never been done before ; we have then proved that the
magnetic force increafes in proceeding from that equa¬
tor to the poles 3 in the laft place, we have given a ma¬
thematical hypothefis, which, when reduced to a for¬
mula, fatisfies all the inclinations hitherto obferved.
Suppofing, as has been done in this formula, the
fmall corrections of which it is fufceptible, its utility
becomes evident, either for making known, in the
courfe of time, the variations which may take place in
the aftion of the terreftrial magnetifm, or to afeertain
or even forefee the value of the inclination, which in a
great many cafes is of the utmoft importance.
For example, near the magnetic equator, the increafe
or diminution of the inclination will indicate to a veffel
on a voyage whether Ihe has gained or loft in latitude
by currents. This knowledge of the latitude is fome-
times as important as that of longitude. On the coafts
of Peru, for example, the currents tend from Chiloe to
the north and north-eaft with fuch force, that one may
go from Lima to Guayaquil in three or four days, and
two, three, and fometimes five months are neceffary to
return. It is confequently of the greateft importance
for veffels coming from Chili which ftretch along the
coaft of Peru, to know their latitude. If they go be¬
yond the port to which they are bound, they muft work
to the fouthward, and every day’s progrefs requires of¬
ten a month of return. Unfortunately, the fogs which
prevail during four or five months on the coaft of Peru,
prevent
(F) Obfervations made at the Cape of Good Hope, Cape Horn, and New Hplland, by different navigators,
are very exactly reprefented by the above-mentioned formula 3 and it follows, that it extends alfo to the auftral
hemifphere. We hope foon to have numerous and very exadft obfervations on the inclination of the needle in that
part of the earth. But we have thought it our duty to add to our table fuch refults as relate to it, and which we
have been able to procure. We have inferted alfo two obfervations on the intenfity, made with great care
by M. Roffel, during the expedition of d’Entrecafteaux, which are very important, as they prove that the
terreftrial magnetic force increafes alfo in the auftral hemifphere in proportion as one removes from the equa¬
tor.

without feeing the fun or ftars, and during that interval
they come to anchor, being afraid of overlhooting their
port; but if we fuppofe that the inclination of the mag¬
netic needle in the ports to the fouth of Lima is known,
for example at Chancay, Huaura, and Santa, the dip¬
ping needle will fliow whether it be, in regard to Lima,
to the fouth or to the north. It will (how at the fame
time oppofite what point of the coaft a veflel is 5 and
this indication will be attended with more exadilnefs
than one could hope for, becaufe in thefe feas the in¬
clination varies wdth extraordinary rapidity. M. Hum¬

Thefe obfervations prove that the error of three or
four degrees in the inclination in thefe feas would pro¬
duce but a degree of error in latitude ; and, on account
of the tranquillity of the Pacific ocean, the inclination
may be obferved to wdthin a degree nearly. Frequent
inllances of fuch refults may be feen in books of voy¬
ages. In like manner, if one knew exactly the incli¬
nation at the mouth of the Rio de la Plata, it w-ould
be very ufeful to navigators, who, when the Pamperos
blow-, remain 15 or 18 days without feeing the hea¬
venly bodies, and go on different tacks for fear of lo-
ling the parallel of the mouth of that river.
In a word, the inclination may indicate alfo the lon¬
gitude in thefe feas 5 and this method may be employed
when others fail. A veffel which fails there in the di-
reftion of a parallel could not find its longitude either
by a chronometer or the declination of Halley, unlefs
a ftar could be feen, in order to take an horary angle
or the magnetic azimuth. The dipping needle then
throws light on the longitude amidft the thickeft fogs.
We point out this method as one of thofe which have
only a local application j but hitherto little attention
has been paid to it. Thefe ideas may be extended and
reflified by able navigators.
In general, if the inclination of the needle, and the
law wre have-tried to eftablilh, could be depended on,
to obferve the inclination and the terrellrial latitude
would alfo be fufficient to determine the longitude j but
we have not yet examined the extent of the errors of
which this method may be fufceptible, and confequently
we confine ourfelves to a mere indication of it.
The phenomenon of the inclination has in maritime
©bfervations a peculiar and very remarkable advantage,
namely, that of not being fubjeft to thofe great pro-
greffive variations which affeft the declination. With¬
out repeating what we have already faid above on the
luppofed conftancy of this phenomenon, it may be re¬
marked that-our formula even affords a new proof that
it may comprehend in the fame law the obfervations
made many years ago in Lapland, thofe which Lacaille
brought back in 1751 from the Cape of Good Hope,
Vol. XII. Part I.
In fhort, when we tried to reprefent the inclinations
in different latitudes by the fuppofition of a magnet in¬
finitely fmall, very near the centre of the earth, and
perpendicular to the magnetic equator, we did not pre¬
tend to confider that hypothefis as any thing real, but
only as a mathematical abltradlion ufeful to conne<ff the
refults, and proper to afcertain in future whether any
changes exift. In regard to the declination and inten-
fity, we freely confefs that we are entirely unacquaint¬
ed with their laws or their caufes 5 and if any philofo-
pher is fo fortunate as to bring them to one principle,
which explains at the fame time the variations of the
inclination, it will no doubt be one of the greateff dif-
coveries ever made. But this refearch, exceedingly
difficult, requires, perhaps, before it be attempted,
more obfervations, and in particular more precile ob¬
fervations, than have hitherto been collefted. For this
reafon we have prefented the preceding refearches, im-
perfedl as they are, hoping our readers will receive
them with indulgence *.
We would willingly have entered into a more full
illuftration of the theory of Atpinus, and compared it
with the phenomena noticed in Chap. II. but the im¬
portant paper juft given has taken up fo much room,
that this article is already extended to very nearly the
utmoft limits affigned to it. We muft therefore con¬
tent ourfelves with giving fome idea of the indudfion of
magnetifm by juxtapofition according to iEpinus’s hy¬
pothefis, and muft refer for the reft to his Tentamen
Theories EleBricitatis et Magnetifmi, or to the abridge¬
ment of it in Van Swinden’s work Sur PAnalogic de
PEleciricite et du Magnetifrne, tom. ii.
Let NAS (fig. 31). be a magnet, of which the part
next the north pole AN is overcharged, and let a bar
of iron j- B « be brought near the north pole of the
magnet, fo that their axes ate in the fame ftraight line.
Now, in this theory, the overcharged pole N atfts on
the iron only by its redundant fluid, for that part of the
fluid which is merely fufficient to faturate the iron will
repel the fluid in B as much as the iron in AN attracts
it, and of courfe can produce no change in B. In the
fame way SA a£ls on B merely by its redundant iron.
Now, were the fluid in r B » immoveable, no fenfible
effect would be produced on it} but as it is fuppofed to
be eafily moveable, the redundant fluid in AN will
have the effeft of repelling it towards «, till the refift-
ance met with there, added to its own tendency to dif-
fufe itfelf uniformly, juft balances the repuliion of AN.
In the mean time, however, an attraction exifts between
the redundant iron in AS, and the fluid in B, by which
the latter would be drawn from B «, and condenfed in
B r, the attradlion oppofing the repulfion above men¬
tioned } but fince AS is more diftant from every point
of B than AN from the fame point, the redundant
fluid will prevail, and on the whole the fluid will be
condenfed towards », and rarefied towards r. The more
diffufed we fuppofe the fluid and iron in the magnet to
be, the more removed will be the centres of effort of
its poles from their extremities, the fmaller will be the
adlion, and the difference of aftion of AN and AS,
and of courfe the fmaller the condenfation towards n%
and the rarefaction towards r. From this we learn,

that, according as the poles of a magnet are more
counteiafted, the greater will be its pow'er of a£Hon 5
and as this is agreeable to obfervation, it gives addition¬
al credit to the hypothefis.
Now, we fee that the piece of iron « B r is attracted
in conlequence of its fluid being repelled towards its re¬
mote extremity, and diftributed fomething like the
fluid in NAS. In this hypothefis magnetifm is fuppof-
ed to depend entirely on the diffufion of magnetic fluid.
The iron B has become a magnet, and by having mag¬
netifm induced on it, is attracted by the magnet A.
In a fimilar w7ay we might explain the adtion of
the magnet, if its fouth or deficient pole were prefented
onpofite to B.
When the notion of a magnetic fluid was once en¬
tertained, it is not furprifing that philofophers, reafon-
ing from the analogy between eledlricity and magnetifm,
and the different effedls arifing from the fouth and
north pole of a. magnet, Ihould be led to the idea of
the magnetic fluid being compounded of two fluids.
Accordingly the hypothefis of two magnetic fluids has
long been a favourite on the continent, where it has
been chiefly fupported by Coulomb and Hairy. As
the experiments and obfervations of the former philofo-
pher entitle him to the higheft refpedl, we fhall here
give a Iketch of bis theory of magnetifm.
1. Coulomb admits of two magnetic fluids, one of
which may be called the northern, and the other the
fouthern fluid.
2. The particles of each of thefe two fluids are mu¬
tually repulfive of each other 5 that is, the particles of the
fluid N mutually repel each other, and the particles of
the fluid S repel each other.
3. There is a mutual attra&ion between the particles
of one of thefe fluids and the particles of the other •, or
the particles of the fluid N attradb and are attracted by
the particles of the fluid S.
4. In the ordinary ftate of iron not magnetized, thefe
two fluids are found mixed together, and hence a piece
of ordinary iron under the ufual circumftances exhibits
no figns of magnetifm.
5. In a magnetized body thefe tw'o fluids are fepa-
rated, and this feparation takes place as foon as we be¬
gin to magnetize the body j one of the fluids N, retir¬
ing towards one extremity, and the other fluid S to the
other extremity of the magnetized body.
6. The attraftion and repulfion of two magnetic bo¬
dies, when they approach each other, is the relult of
the mutual adlion of the two fluids.
Suppofe wre have two needles A and B. If we make
them approach each other on the fide of the two poles
of the fame name, N or S, they will repel each other }
but if they are made to approach on the fide of differ¬
ent poles, as when the needle A prefents .its north pole
to the fouth pole of the needle B, they will attradl
each other. Here there are four forces in adlion ; 1.
the fluid N of the needle A repels the fluid N of the
needle B. 2 The fame fluid N of the needle A at¬
tracts the fluid S of the needle B. 3. The fluid S of
the needle A repels the fluid S of the needle B ; and
4. The fluid S of the needle A attracts the fluid N of
the needle B. Now, if the extremity N of the needle
A be very near the extremity S of the needle B, the
mutual attraction between the twm fluids N and S, will
be itronger than the mutual repulfion between the two
fluids N, N, and the two fluids S, S, and confequently Theory,
the twTo needles will approach each other. ——y——
7. The attraction and repulfion of the two magnetic
fluids is in the direCt ratio of the maffes, and in the in-
verfe ratio of the diftances.
'1 his important part of the theory Coulomb deduces
from a feries of very delicate experiments made with
his magnetic bars, fimilar to thofe by which he proved
the fame law to take place with refpeCt to the aCtion of
the eleClric fluid. See Electricity, Part IV. chap. ii.
8. The magnetic fluid is entirely in the interior o^
magnetic bodies, for as the magnetic fluid moves with
difficulty in the interior of a magnetic body, it cannot
diffufe itfelf over the furface, which is the reafon why
filings of iron brought near a magnetic bar, remain at¬
tached to it.
9. Confequently magnetic bodies can have no mag¬
netic atmofphere.
10. In a magnetic needle, the centres of magnetic
a£lion are near the extremities of the needle.
11. A magnetic needle being broken in any place,
each of its parts is found to have twTo poles.
12. The forces wffiich attradl a needle towards one
pole, are equal to thofe wffiich draw it toward the other
pole.
13. Magnetic bodies do not act on other bodies fuf-
ceptible of magnetifm, in any other w?ay than by at-
tradtion or repulfion j for the magnetic fluid remains
entirely within the interior of thefe bodies.
14. Magnetic attradlion ought to be regarded as a
particular power, analogous, however, to the power
wdiich we call univerfal gravitation, the only dif¬
ference being, that gravitation adts very fenfibly on
all bodies, whereas magnetifm adts moft powerfully on
iron.
15. This magnetic power or attradlion is therefore a
particular power produced neither by impulfion, nor by
the adtion of any other fluid. I0^
Though the inftrument which is ufually employed to Coulomb’s
meafure the inclination of the magnetic needle is very mode of
Ample in its conftrudtion, it is neverthelefs liable to ^certaimri£
great errors, which in general arife from the almofl: ab-
folute impoffibility of placing the needle in all the pofi-
tions it can take in equilibrium with regard to the ef-
fedt of gravitation, that is to fay, fo that its centre of
gravity may always exadlly agree wfith the point on
which it turns. When the dimenfions are confiderable,
a new inconvenience arifes from a degree of flexure,
which, though fcarcely fenfible, is neverthelefs pre-
dudtive of very great effedts from the ffightefi: dif-
placement of the centre of gravity producing a com¬
bination of the power of gravitation with that of mag¬
netifm.
To obviate thefe difficulties, Citizen Coulomb, in-
flead of endeavouring to afcertain immediately, as has
been hitherto done, the diredlion of the magnetic
needle in the vertical plane which paffes through the
magnetic pole, conceives the force of this pole to be
decompofed or refolved into two others in the fame
plane, the one adting in a horizontal, and the other in
a vertical diredfion. He determines feparately the in-
tenfity of each of thefe iaft forces, and the refult gives
the diredlion in which the magnetic force adls, and
which a needle governed fingly by this force would
take,.

Theory. Citizen Coulomb has proved, in tbe Memoirs of tbe
Academv of Sciences for tbe year 17S9, that the mag¬
netic needle fufpended by its centre of gravity is incei-
fantly brought back to its true direftion by a conftant
force at the fame place and time. It thence follows,
that by obferving the number of olcillations made in a
given time by a needle horizontally fufpended, the ra¬
tio of the horizontal component part of the magneuc
power with gravity may be obtained. As to the verti¬
cal component part, it is meafured by determining with
care the weight neceffary to be added to^ the fouthem
part of the magnetic needle, to maintain it in a perfect¬
ly horizontal pofition. 1 hat being done, if A and
reprefent the refpeftive meafures of the horizontal and
vertical component parts of the magnetic pmver, will
be the tangent of the angle made by their refult with
the horizontal force, and confequently, it will be the in¬
clination of the magnetic needle.
In the experiments made by Citizen Coulomb, the
needle had the form of a right angled parallelopipedon,
very thin in proportion to its breadth, and always lu -
pended fo that its breadth was kept in a vertical plane.
Let P reprefent the weight of the needle, / the half of
its length, X the length of a pendulum that performs
its ofcillations in the fame time as the needle when it
obeys the magnetic power in a horizontal plane. Cou¬
lomb then gives the formula to calculate the mo¬
mentum of the magnetic force referred to the arm of a
lever of one millimeter in length. 1 he length of the
needle was 427 millimeters, its breadth 13, and its
wreight 88,753 milligrammes. It was fufpended hori¬
zontally by a thread of fdk in a box well clofed, and it
made 30 ofcillations in 286 feconds, and by applying
thefe data to the preceding formula, Coulomb found
that the logarithm of the momentum of the horizontal
magnetic force is 4.1740. # ~ .
Coulomb having placed his needle m a clip, having
knife edges, which refted on two cylinders of glafs,
in the manner of the beam of a balance, endeavouied
firft to bring it to an equilibrium in a horizontal fitua-
ticn coinciding with the magnetic meridian, by placing
the edges in a proper manner, and when they were fuf-
ficiently near the point where the equilibrium ^ took
place, he completed it by the addition of fmall weights.
He theji reverfed the poles of the needle by the magne¬
tic touch, but without altering the pofition of the clip,
and again bringing it to an equilibrium in this new
ftate, the fum of the momenta of the additional weights
placed in thefe two operations gave him the double of
the momentum of the vertical component parts of the

ftrument for making accurate obfervations on the dip.
The refult of this
force, and of the horizontal force, is inclined 68° 9'.
In repeating thefe operations three times, Coulomb
found fucceflively 68° 9', 68° 13', and 68° 11'. Though
the differences of thefe refults are very trifling, he
thinks they are to be entirely attributed to errors in the
obfervation ; for he is affured they do not amount to fo
much. It is poffible that the needle is fubjett to varia¬
tions in the vertical fimilar to thole which are known to
take place in the horizontal plane. _ > _
Daniel Bernoulli contrived an ingenious dipping
It depends on the following principle. Ii a dipping
needle be made by an ordinary workman, and balanced dipping
with fome care, fo that when impregnated with mague-needle,
tifm, it may fliow nearly the true dip, and if it be
touched, and the dip obferved, then its magnetifm de-
ftroyed, and its balance fo altered, that without any
magnetifm it wdll take nearly the inclination of tbe true
dip •, and if it be then touched again, giving it the fame
polarity as it had before, it is evident that it will now
approach very nearly to the true dip, fince, by its want
of perfect equilibrium it was deranged only a few de¬
grees from its proper direction. If the fecond obferva¬
tion of the dip fhould, from the inaccurate formation of
the needle, differ confiderably from the firff, the opera¬
tion mult be repeated ; and in this third obferva¬
tion there will very feldom be an error of more than
half a degree.
Bernoulli’s inftrument is as follows. A very light
graduated brafs circle EFG (fig. 32.) is fixed on one
fide of the dipping needle, fo as to be concentric with
its axis, and the whole is balanced with as much nicety
as may be, before being impregnated, CD is a very
light index fixed to the axis in fucha manner as to turn
on it with fome difficulty. By this the equilibrium of
the needle will be deftroyed. If great care has been
taken in forming the inftrument, and if it has been ba¬
lanced with great accuracy, it will, by the addition of
the index, be made to fettle fo as to have the index
perpendicular to the horizon, at whatever degree of the
circle the needle may happen to point. As fuch accu¬
racy, however, is fcarcely to be expelled, let the in¬
dex be fet to feveral different degrees of the circle, and
note the inclination taken by the needle before being
magnetized, correfponding to each pofition of the index,
and let all thefe be written down. For example, let
us fuppofe that when the index is at 50°, the needle in¬
clines 46° from the horizon $ if we obferve at any place
that the needle, after being magnetized, inclines 46°,
when the index is at 50°, we may be fure that the for¬
mer is the true magnetic dip at that place, as the needle
is not deranged by the magnetifm that has been given
it, from the fituation it would affume by gravity alone.
We ufually know fomething of the dip that may be ex¬
pelled at any place. If we fet the index accordingly,
and if the needle does not then point out the expefted
dip, change the pofition of the index, and again obferve
the dip } examine whether this fecond pofition of the
index and the fecond dip form a correfponding pair of
numbers, fuch as we have written down j if they do,
we have got the true dip, but if not, another pofition
of the index muft be tried. Thus, by noticing whe¬
ther the agreement of this laft pair be greater or lefs
than that of the former pair of numbers, we learn whe¬
ther we are to change the pofition of the index in the I0(-
fame or in the oppofite diredlion. Analogy
A clofe analogy has long been remarked between thebetween
phenomena of magnetifm and thofe of induced eledlrici-electricity
ty, efpecially thofe of attraction and repulfion. The me-“mitilasne
chanical compofition of thefe aClions produces a directive
power and polarity, both in eleCtrical and magnetical
bodies. It is eafy to form an eledtrical needle that will
arrange itfelf with refpedt to the overcharged and under¬
charged ends of a body eledtrified by pofition, juft as a
,3 D 2 magnetic
396 M A G N ]
( Theory, magnetic needle arranges itfelf with refpeft to the mag-
' net. A flick of fealing wax may be touched in a manner
fimilar to the double magnetic touch, fo as to acquire poles
of confiderable force, and very durable. Again, melted
fealing wax, when cooled in the neighbourhood of a po-
litive and negative eleftric, acquires permanent poles,
juft as a red hot fteel bar acquires them by being
quenched near a magnet. Laftly, lightning fometimes
gives polarity to needles, fometimes deftroys it, and
fometimes reverfes their polarity.
From thefe various circumflances of refemblance,
fome have luppofed that both phenomena originate from
the fame caufe, but there are feveral cireumftances
which ftiow their original caufes to be different. Thus,
we find that eleftricity is common to all bodies, and
can be excited or induced on all in a degree that is
pretty nearly equal. Magnetifm, on the contrary,
though from Coulomb’s experiments, it appears in fome
degree to affeft all terreftrial bodies, afts, however,
very imperceptibly on all but iron and its compounds.
The adtion of lightning muft not be confidered as a
proof of their identity, fince that is accompanied with
a great degree of heat, and we have already feen that
this power, under favourable circumftances, is a very
ailive agent, both in producing and deftroying magne¬
tifm. Again, there is nothing in magnetifm like a'
body being entirely overcharged, or entirely under¬
charged, as in eledlricity ; but a magnetic body having
two poles, muft always be overcharged at one extremi¬
ty, and undercharged at the other. There is nothing
in magnetifm refembling that inconveivably rapid mo¬
tion which we fee in eledhicity. In fine, the only per-
fedl refemblance is between the induced magnetifm of
common iron, and the induced eledlricity of a conduc¬
tor. On the arguments that have been employed for
and agjrnft the identity of magnetifm and ele&ricity,
eur readers may confult Van Swinden, Sur I'Analogie
de I'Eletlricite, et du Magnetifme, and a trail by iEpinus
De Similitudine EleBricitatis et Magnetifmi.
Some late experiments of Ritter tend to fliow a greater
analogy than has yet been fuppofed, between magne¬
tifm and that modification of eleilricity which we call
galvanifm.
107 Mr Ritter’s firft experiments with the magnet were
Ritter’s ex-on frogS> jje foun(J that a magnetic iron wire, with
gemnents. anotj1€,r not magnetic, excited a galvanic palpitation in
thefe animals. Prefently he ob%ved, that the fouth
pole excited ftronger palpitations, and the north pole
weaker, than the iron not magnetic. Having con-
ftantly noticed, that the metals moft fufceptible of oxi¬
dation excited the ftrongeft palpitations, he inferred,
that the fouth pole poffeffes a greater affinity for oxygen
than Ample iron, and the north pole lefs.
This fuppofition he confirmed by means of feveral
chemical re-agents. He placed a magnetic iron wire
on pieces of glafs in a plate of earthen w^are, and pour¬
ed upon it a very weak nitric acid. The fouth pole
was attacked by the acid much more powerfully than
the north ; and was foon furrounded by a depofition of
oxygen, the quantity of which greatly exceeded that of
the other pole.
The different oxidability of the magnetic pole* is very
well exhibited likewife, by taking three fmall bottles
of equal fize, filled with water, either pure or flightly
acidulated, and putting into one the fouth polar end of
t T I S M. Chap. III.
a magnetic wire, into a fecond the north polar end of Theory,
a fimilar wire, and into the third the end of an equal —v—
wrire not magnetic *, the fouth pole will firft begin to
depofit oxide, the unmagnetic iron a little after, and
the north pole laft. This experiment requires confide¬
rable care. The furface of the water muft be covered
with very frefti oil of almonds, to exclude all accefs of
air. Care muft be taken too, that one of the bottles is
not more expofed to the fun than the others, becaufe
light accelerates oxidation. Ritter convinced himfelf
of this by diredl experiments ; expofing two iron wires
in water to the fun, but covering one of the phials with
black paper, when that in the phial left uncovered was
oxidated much more quickly.
If infufion of litmus be fubftituted inftead of the wa¬
ter in the three phials in the preceding experiment, the
relative oxidations will be the fame, but they will be
attended with a change of colour, (bowing that an acid
is produced proportional to each oxidation ; fo that the
fouth pole not only undergoes the greateft oxidation,
but likewife reddens the infufton of litmus moft. The
a6lion that takes place in this experiment is very feeble,
and frequently requires a week to produce a diftinfl ef¬
fect ; and indeed to accelerate it fo much as this, it Is
neceffary to add, previoufly to the infufion, as much
acetic acid as will incline it to red, without completely
changing its colour. The infufion reddened in this ex¬
periment refumes its blue colour on expofure to the air ;
but we muft not hence conclude, that the acid pro¬
duced by the aftion of the magnet is very volatile, for
infufion of litmus reddened by phofphoric acid, or any
other, exhibits the fame phenomenon.
The following experiment exhibits fome things pecu¬
liar, and therefore we (hall give it more at large. , It
has not been repeated, but the harmony of its refults is
in favour of its accuracy. Sixteen magnetic wires, of
equal fize and power, were placed in fix veffels, all
equally full of a mixture of one part nitric acid, and
36 parts water, in the following manner : in the firft
glafs were placed two wires, one with the north pole
immerfed in the fluid, the other with the fouth, and not
more than half a line afunder : in the fecond, the fame,
but the wires an inch and three-fourths apart : in the
third and fourth were each three wires, writh the fouth
poles of all immerfed, but their diftances in the two
glaffes different, as in the firft and fecond : in the fifth
and fixth were wires fimilarly arranged, but with the
north poles immerfed. Different quantities of oxide
wrfere gradually depofed, and to exprefs the whole in
few words, we will call the fouth pole S, the north
pole N, their greater diftance^, and their lefs />, and we
will exprefs the order of oxidations as follows: SN(§-"^5’
SN/)-^3 S^-^3 On the
nineteenth day it was obferved, that the lofs of fluid by
evaporation had not been equal in all the veffels, but
took place in the inverfe order of the oxidations. All
the magnetic wires were weakened in power; NS^
leaft ; NS/> more : of the wires 3 S/>, two had loft lefs
power than the third ; and in like manner 3 S^, 3
3 N^, had each two left more powerful than the third ;
the ftrongeft: were equal to NSj-.
In another experiment, where two little veffels filled
with infufion of litmus were employed, one of them
containing two magnetic wires, the fouth poles of which,
were immerfed in the fluid ; the other two fimilar wares,

_v tion was greateft in the latter veflel.
The analogy between galvanifm and magnetifm is
flill farther proved by other experiments of Ritter on
ga/vani-z/ng metals, which he does by placing them in
a dream of galvanic fluid proceeding from a ftrong pile.
He found that a golden needle thus galvanized and ba¬
lanced on a pivot, exhibited, like a magnetized iron
needle, both dire&ive power and horizontal inclination.
Some late experiments of Ritter, referring Hill more
dire&ly to the analogy between magnetifm and galva¬
nifm, were communicated to the Royal Academy of
Sciences of Munich, and the following are their gene¬
ral refults.
1. Every magnet is equivalent to a pair of heteroge¬
neous metals united together •, its different poles repre-
fent as it were different metals.
2. Like them, it gives electricity ; that is to fay,
one of the two poles, the pofitive electricity, and the o-
ther the negative.
3. By following the fame procefs, a certain number
of magnets, as well as a certain number of pairs of
metals, afforded eleCtricity j and in this manner the
eleCtricities afforded by the poles of different magnets,
have been fuccefsfully indicated by the eleCtrometer.
4. By means of thefe eleCtricities, one of thefe bat¬
teries of magnets, accordingly as it is more or lefs
ftrong, produces upon dead and living bodies, all the
phenomena which are produced by a pile of Volta, of
the common kind, and of the fame force.
397
5. The experiments W’hich prove this, fliow, that in Theory,
magnetized iron, the fouth pole gives pofitive eleCtrici-
ty, and the north pole negative eleCtricity j but that
on the contrary in magnetized fled, the north pole af¬
fords the pofitive, and the fouth pole the negative.
6. ihe fame inverfe difpofition is alfo obferved with
regard to the polar oxidability of the magnetized body
in which this change is produced by magnetifm. In
magnetized iron the fouth pole is moft oxidable, and the
north pole leaft ; whereas in magnetized fled the north
pole is moft oxidable, and the fouth leaft.
7. Mr Ritter thinks, that by confidering the earth
as an immenfe magnet, thefe refults might ferve to ex¬
plain various phenomena of nature, fuch as the phyfical
difference between the two hemifpheres, the aurora
borealis and aurora auftralis. In fad, after what has
been juft ftated, the earth confidered as a magnet, may
be taken as an equivalent to an immenfe pile of Volta,
of which the poles are on one fide fufficiently clofed by
the waters of the ocean. And the aCtion of this pile
muff produce, and has produced the greateft chemical
changes in the materials of the earth •, changes which *
muff have differed according to the poles ; and of
which pile the poles at the other extremity have always
fuch an abundance of detiricity as to caufe its fplendour
to appear by radiations in the vaft fpaces of theheavens*.
The foregoing experiments appear to prove that mag-Nicbolfon's
netifm has fome effedt in producing chemical changes, Journal.
and thence we may infer that perhaps it would not be Xv’
altogether inadlive in the animal economy.

Animal Animal Magnetism, a fympathy fuppofed by fome
perfons to exift between the magnet and the human bo-
dy ; by means of which the former, it was thought,
pofieffed the property of curing many difeafes.
The notion of animal magnetifin appears to have
originated, in 1774, wfith a German philofopher named
Tether Held, who greatly recommended the ufe of the
magnet in medicine. M. Mefiner, a phyiician of the
f

deviating from the tenets of his inftrudlor, he loft his v
patronage, as well as that of Dr Ingenhoufz, which he
had formerly enjoyed. Mefmer had already diftinguifh-
ed himfelf by “ A diflertation on the influence of the
Stars upon the human body,” which he publicly de¬
fended in a thefis before the univerlity of Vienna ; but
he
MAG [ 399 ] MAG
Animal he was fo unable to Hand before the oppofition of Hehl
Magnetifm. an(j Ingenboufz, that his fyftem fell alraoll inftantly in-
to difrepute. Mefmer appealed to the Academy of
Sciences at Berlin •, but they rejefted his principles as
deflitute of foundation, and unworthy of the fmalleft
attention. He then made a tour through Germany,
publilhing everywhere the great cures he performed by
means of his animal magnetifm, while his enemies eve¬
rywhere purfued him with detedlions of the falfeheod of
his aflertions.
Mefmer, ftill undaunted by fo many defeats, returned
to Vienna 5 but meeting there with no better fuccefs
than before, he retired to Paris in the beginning of the
year 1778. Plere he met with a very different recep¬
tion. He was firft patronized by the author of the
Diciionnaire des Merveilles de la Nature; in which
work a great number of his cures were publilhed, Mef¬
mer himfelf receiving likewdfe an ample teftimony of
his candour and folid reafoning. Our phyfician foon
collected fome patients 5 and in the month of April
1778 retired with them to Creteil, from whence he in
a thort time returned with them perfe&ly cured. Plis
fuccefs was now as great as his former difappointment.
Patients increafed fo rapidly that the dodlor was foon
obliged to take in pupils to aflift him in his operations.
Thefe pupils fucceeded equally wHl as Mefmer him¬
felf-, and fo well did they take care of their own emo¬
lument, that one of them named M. Deflon realized
upw-ards of ioo,ocol. fterling. In 1779 Mefmer pub-
lilhed a memoir on the fubjedl of Animal Magnetifm,
promifing afterwards a complete work upon the fame,
which fhould make as great a revolution in philofophy
as it had already done hr medicine.
The new fyffem now' gained ground daily j and foon
became fo falhionable, that the jealoufy of the faculty
was roufed, and an application concerning it wras made
to government. In confequence of this a committee
was appointed to inquire into the matter, confiding
partly of phyficians and partly of members of the Royal
Academy of Sciences, with Dr Benjamin Franklin at
their head. This was a thunderftroke to the fupporters
of the new dodfrine. Mefmer himfelf refufed to have
any communication wfith the committee j but his molt
celebrated pupil Deflon was lefs fcrupulous, and ex¬
plained the principles of his art in the following man¬
ner :
1. Animal magnetifm is an univerfal fluid, confti-
tuting an abfolute plenum in nature, and the medium
of all mutual influence between the celeftial bodies,
and betwdxt the earth and animat bodies.
2. It is the molt fubtle fluid in nature ; capable of a
flux and reflux, and of receiving, propagating, and con¬
tinuing all kinds of motion.
3. The animal body is fubjedted to the influences of
this fluid by means of the nerves, which are immediate¬
ly affedted by it.
4. The human body has poles and other properties
analogous to the magnet.
5. The adtion and virtue of animal magnetifm may
be communicated from one body to another, whether
animate or inanimate.
6. It operates at a great diftance without the inter¬
vention of any body.
7. It is increafed and refledted by mirrors j commu¬
nicated, propagated, and increafed by found ; and may
be accumulated, concentrated, and tranfported.
8. Notwithfianding the univerfality of this fluid, all
animal bodies are not equally affedted by it on the
other hand, there are fome, though but few in number,
the prefence of which deftroys all the effedls of animal
magnetifm.
9. By means of this fluid nervous diforders are cured
immediately, and others mediately ; and its virtues, in
flrort, extend to the univerfal cure and prefervation of
mankind.
Animal
Masmetifni.
From this extraordinary theory, Mefmer or M. Def¬
lon, had fabricated a paper, in which he flated that
there was in nature but one difeafe and one cure, and
that this cure w'as animal magnetifm : and laftly,
M. Deflon engaged, 1. To prove to the commiflioners,
that fuch a thing as animal magnetifm exifted ;
2. To prove the utility of it in the cure of dlfeafes;
after which he was to communicate to them all that
he knew upon the fubjedl. The commiflioners accord¬
ingly attended in the room where the patients under¬
went the magnetical operations. The apparatus con-
fifted of a circular platform made of oak, and raifed
about a foot and a half from the ground; which
platform was called the baquet. At the top of it w-ere
a number of holes, in which w-ere iron rods with move¬
able joints for the purpofe of applying them to any part
of the body. The patients were placed in a circle round,
each touching an iron rod, which he could apply to any
part of the body at pleafure ; they w'ere joined to one
another by a cord pafling round their bodies, the de-
fign being to increafe the effedt by communication. In
the corner of the room r»as a piano forte, on which
fome airs were played, occafionally accompanied with a
fong. Each of the patients held in his hand an iron
rod ten or twelve feet long ; the intention of which, as
Deflon told the commiflioners, was to concentrate the
magnetifm in its point, and thus to render its effedts
more fenfible. Sound is another condudlor of this mag¬
netifm 5 and in order to communicate the magnetifm to
the piano forte, nothing more is neceflary than to bring
the iron rod near it. Some magnetifm is alfo furniftied
by the perfon who plays it 5 and this magnetilmis tranf-
mitted to the patients by the founds. The internal part
of the platform was faid to be fo contrived as to concen¬
trate the magnetifm, and was the refervoir whence the
virtue diffufed itfelf among the patients. Its ilrudlure,
however, is not mentioned ; but the committee fatisfied
themfelves, by means of a needle and eledtrometer, that
neither common magnetifm nor eledlricity was con¬
cerned.
Befides the different ways of receiving the magnetifm
already mentioned, viz. by the iron, cord, and piano
forte, the patients alfo had it diredtly from the dodlor’s
finger, and a rod which he held in his hand, and which
he carried about the face, head, or fuch parts of the
patient as were difeafed -, obferving always the direc¬
tion of what he called the poles. The principal appli¬
cation of magnetifm, however, was by preflure of the
hands or fingers on the hypochondria or low'er regions
of the ffomach.
The effecls of thefe operations upon Deflon’s pa¬
tients were very different. Some felt nothing, neither
had the magnetifm any effebt whatever upon them.
Somr;
MAG [ 400 ] MAH
A-nimal Sorae fpit, coughed, fvveat, and felt, or pretended to
Magnetifiri. £eei, extraordinary heats in different parts of the body.
Many women, but very few men, had convulfions,
which Deflon called their crifis, Sec.—The commif-
fioners at laft found that they could come to no fatis-
faftory conclufion while they attended in this public
way, and therefore determined to try the experiments
themfelves privately. As the fluid itfelf, however,
was totally imperceptible by any of the fenfes, they
could only afeertain themfelves of its exiftence by ul¬
timately curing difeafes, or by its obfervable effects
upon the human body. Being well alfured, howrever,
that though many difeafes wrere cured, it would not
amount to any proof of the exiflence of animal mag-
netifm, they determined to obferve its effefts on the
animal economy. For this purpofe they made the fol¬
lowing experiments :
1. They tried it upon themfelves, and felt no¬
thing.
2. Seven of Deflon’s patients were magnetized at
Dr Franklin’s houfe, four of whom felt nothing ; three
felt, or affe6ted to feel, fomething.
3. Several perfons in a higher fphere of life were
magnetized, and felt nothing.
4. The commiflioners, now' determined to difeover
what (hare imagination had in this bufinefs, blind¬
folded feveral of the common people, and made them
fometimes think that they were magnetized, at other
times they magnetized them without letting them
knowr that they did fo : the confequence was, that
when they fuppofed themfelves magnetized, the pa¬
tients likewife thought they felt fomething, and vice
verfa.
5. A magnetized tree was faid to produce convul-
flons; a young man, blindfolded, fell into convulflons
when he imagined himfelf near the tree, though he
W'as really at a confiderable diftance from it. Deflon
accounted for this on the principle of all trees being
magnetic : but in this cafe, every one, fufceptible of
magnetifm, would be feized with convulfions when
he approached a tree. The lame influence of imagi¬
nation was obferved in a wToman accuftomed to have
convulfions when magnetized. They came on when
nothing wTas done to her, on being told, when blinded,
that (he wras magnetized.
Other inftances are given, from which it was evident,
either that the patients were impoflors, or in fuch a moft
wretched ftate of debility both of mind and body, that
the moft trifling effects of the former had the moft
powerful effedts on the latter. The commiflioners there¬
fore entirely difapprovpd of the whole. The touch,
imitation, and imagination, they concluded, were the
great caufes of the effects produced by M. Deflon’s ope¬
rations *, and by means of thefe they fuppofed, that con¬
vulfions, which in themfelves are a very violent difor-
der, might be fpread much farther than could be wifti-
ed, even through a whole city. It was obferved that
the operator fometimes preffed ftrongly, and for a
length of time, upon different parts of the body, parti¬
cularly the hypochondria and pit of the ftomach j and
it is well known that a ftrong preffure on thefe parts
will produce difagreeable fenfations in thofe who enjoy
perfefl health.
It is needlefs to add more upon this fubjeft, than
that Melmer complained of the report of the commif-
3
fioners, petitioned parliament, w'as by them command-Magnifying
ed to difeover the myileries of his dodlrine 5 and that it
is now' exploded by every man of fenfe.—The conclu-. - —v —>
fion of the academicians concerning it wras, that it is not
entirely ufelefs even to philofophy 5 as it is one fa£l
more to be configned to the hiftory of the errors and il-
lufions of the human mind, and a fignal inftance of the
power of imagination.
